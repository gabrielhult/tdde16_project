Ive been considering Miltons and others position that robber barons are a myth. And I was throwing stuff mad when I first heard people saying robber barons is a myth but I think im starting to understand why people like ayn rand and thomas dilorenzo and robert murphey say that its a myth. The start of the railroad industry is a good example. there was nasty dirty dealings but there was also alot of jobs created and alot of product moved quickly to sale around the country and raised profits for lots of people that wouldnt have otherwise had those profits. yeah there could have been a more fair way for the railroads to have land aquired and been built.  im just wrapping my mind around this and im not saying i believe it. im just trying to fully understand the position.,Conservative

"Which theory of the business cycle do you agree with most? I’m curious what people here think after seeing some recent posts.

A quick breakdown:

Keynesian: Recessions happen when bad news spooks consumers and investors who cut back on spending. Wages get stuck in place above equilibrium, causing unemployment. We will be stuck there until planned investment expenditure is restored. 

Austrian: Recessions are the inevitable consequence of an economic boom fueled by easy credit (too much money printing) that leads investors to make bad investments. 

Monetarist: Keynesian except the cause isn’t bad news is negative monetary shocks. 

New Classical: Monetarist except is *unexpected* negative monetary shocks and people’s expectations are right on average. 

Real Business Cycle Theory: Events out of our control reduce labor productivity and people wisely exit labor markets. Recessions are not a deviation from a “trend”, they represent an economy at equilibrium. Only supply-side solutions help. 

New Keynesian: New Classical except nominal wage rigidity (wages change slowly) means the Fed can basically smooth out the business cycle with competent monetary policy.

"Controlling the message a la Swarmwise? If you haven't heard of Falkvinge's book, Swarmwise, take a look: http://falkvinge.net/2013/02/14/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-one/

In particular, he discusses the idea here: http://falkvinge.net/2013/09/01/swarmwise-the-tactical-manual-to-changing-the-world-chapter-eight/ under ""CALLS TO ARMS: PERCEPTION IS REALITY""

To paraphrase, the goal is ""controlling the message"" that appears in the media. Basically, come up with a system of rallying people competent to rebut wrong ideas that pop up so that the observing public sees the rebuttals and the right ideas over & over, and also gets the impression that there are more people that believe in the right ideas than the wrong ones.

In essence, an extremely vocal minority takes control of the public dialogue.

"I believe that the anti work movement, along with other ""left leaning"" economic ideologies are a huge extension of capitalism. I just had to get this off my chest somewhere, I see anti work activists denounce capitalism all the time. What they don't realize is that they are the reason capitalism grows and evolves to fit the market.

The best example is anti work. I don't agree with what the members over there say by any stretch of the imagination. But I don't think that the people who support anti work understand that Capitalism is what let's them advocate for higher wages or more pay in general. Half of capitalism is aimed at the workers. If you aren't happy with your job, you can leave for a higher paying job, or bargain for higher wages with them. It is supply and demand. What the anti work movement supporters might not understand is that strikes and unionizing isn't anti-capitalist, it's actually the reason that capitalism thrives. The whole idea of capitalism is that over time the people will make better decisions than the government. The only downside is that it takes a little more time than forcing everyone to conform with a new rule or law enforced by the government. 

Tdlr; movements like anti-work aren't fighting capitalism, they are the reason that capitalism grows and helps the economy as a whole over time.",Conservative

"The worst part about work isn't my boss. It's my lazy, whiney, selfish co-workers... I know this isn't about capitalism but I need to vent because I'm tired and extremely frustrated. I'm sorry if this isn't allowed.

I go to work today and in the middle of trying to load about 5 trips of steel at about 1 ton each trip my co-worker leaves... ""I need to get to the bar"" he says. I'm pretty frustrated because yesterday he left and made a bunch of incorrect holes in some plates that I was working on so I stayed late and fixed them all.

I arrive at work and another co-worker immediately comes complaining and telling me I have to help him find a drill chuck. He doesn't have the time he says. My boss had informed me that I needed to deliver a beam to a jobsite so I didn't have time either.

Both of these co-workers are huge believers in their uncompensated value. They both believe that the company is exploiting them and that they aren't paid enough. Hogwash I say. Neither will lift a finger if I'm struggling with something. They think my boss is the problem but it's them...

I start school at 7:30 AM. My first break is from 9:20 - 10. My next one is from 11:20 - 12:30. I get out of class and go directly to work at 2:20. I'm off between 8-10 depending on homework. They think I shouldn't complain because I brought this on myself. 

I think they shouldn't complain because they are lazy assholes who deserve every ounce on misery they get. Someday if I own a business, I will treat the crappy employees like crap. I will reward the good ones with all of the money they earned and the money I would have paid the lousy workers if they weren't terrible employees. I will think of all the terrible co-workers in the world and I will hope that it's their kids that I'm taking unearned raises from and giving them to the workers who deserve it 

So yeah. I guess I feel a little better. Thanks.",Conservative

For causing trouble to our esteemed Chinese customers, partners and the general public, we express our sincere apologies.”

Intel’s apology comes after social media users this week seized on the issue to criticize the U.S. firm. The lead singer of TFBoys -- one of China’s most popular boy bands -- Wang Junkai said it will terminate all partnerships with the U.S. company immediately, according to a statement by his studio Wednesday. The studio said it had repeatedly asked Intel to “express a correct stance,” but the chipmaker had yet to respond.

The company had  ‘no other intention and did not mean to express a position on the matter’, according to the statement.

"Marxist outdated cliche#1 ""cuba is poor because of US sanction""

Doesn't communism aim to abolish all forms of trade in  the first place? Castro had this economic ""import substitution"" scheme,which means trying to get rid of imports while trying to bolster local production i order to reach a self-sustaining economy or an Autarky.the iaim of an autarky is to eventually cut all sorts of trade.and the latter mentioned is/was a common theme among already extinct communist regimes of the past. Japan and the soyviet onion is a case in point:

Incel Soyviet onion-exports local grain in able to purchase Western technology and raw materials for the NEP'a hard industry growth.

Based Japan-Import raw materials,capitalise on their productivity then export for profit.

This example alone proves how superior free market capitalists are. Japan has very limited natural resources. while russia have one of the biggest gas reserves and minerals on earth,yet The economic gap between the two is astronomical. Japan will make russia look like a burger flipper in terms of wealth.

Isnt there a real chance this turns into WWIII? Putin named off a lot more countries than Ukraine, could be Poland next, if he acts out against a NATO country shit gets serious fast. 

On top of that, China is already playing games with Taiwan. Which I might add is the hub of our biggest economy, technology/microprocessors, which we are already behind on. If China ends up backing Russia, they would be one hell of a force to reckon with. 

I feel like people are underestimating how this could play out. 

The only thing that keeps me somewhat convinced it won't be WWIII is the amount of Russians speaking out against Russia being involved. WWII Era Germany seemed like a cult following compared to how Russians feel about Russia right now. But, with enough tyranny, propaganda, and fear people can quickly lose confidence to speak out. 

I will add, there has been some pretty crazy videos of Russians talking about it in interviews, and it's nuts to see how each country lives in their own media dome and has their own narrative. They didn't seem too upset about it.

But the mere existence of that tension/demand/incentive raises ethical and rational questions for me concerning the logical underpinning of anarchocapitalism.  

I can get all wordy with it but over the years arguing with my Ancap friends I have reduced it to a pretty basic scenario/question so here goes-

if you are born into a stateless society and have no land, then you are necessarily reduced to organizing your entire life around gratifying the interests of those who do.  And there is little incentive for them to permit the elevation of your station.  So, why is it not coercion to tell a newborn baby, ""Oh you want water? Get a job.""


*my working out of this conundrum has since caused me to abandon the moral and logical precepts of AC'ism in search of an idea that respects the property of our species' cognitive hardware that recognizes rather instinctively the injustice of dooming babies to servitude and barring their access to territorial resources for their sustenance.

"Libertarians make the argument against welfare or benefits of sorts and I'm just curious how exactly that would work out. Would it improve things or make them simply worse. Discuss. Living in the UK we have a welfare system known as benefits and while it does help people in need it also gets taken advantage of big time so my personal opinion is that welfare should be a thing but it should be massively regulated and more strict than what it already is. As to prevent people exploiting it. 

Are people out there who are in desperate need and need that financial support. Whether they're jobless, have or developed a disability or perhaps they're parents who do work but are struggling financially to look after their children. 

Because the simple fact is that if these people don't get money somehow they're going to be thrown into extreme levels of poverty and endured homelessness. And as it's well documented it's a lot harder to get back up on your feed once you're made homeless. 

One underlying issue with the benefit system is that due to the fact it gets exploited by lowlifes that means the people who desperately need the support aren't getting it due to how much of a money drain these other leeches are being. 

&#x200B;

However, I've noticed that it appears to be a Libertarian belief to abolish welfare entire and I think I understand the premise behind it. Making us less independent of the government for funds and establishing some sort of independence but I find it somewhat difficult to agree with. 

I don't like government as much as the next joe but abolishing welfare entirely just seems like a sure fine way to throw potentially millions of people (depending where you live) into extreme poverty. 

Not sure how having an increased homelessness, child mortality and increased starvation figures would benefit us as a society. 

Sure the government would certainly have loads more money for other things like committing war crimes in third world nations but how would this benefit us as a society. 

&#x200B;

I'm not too sure how the US system works so you'll have to create your own plan for that but in terms of the UK what I think I'd do is I'd abolish or massively regulate unemployment benefits as that's a system that is always exploited. 

Believe it's been changed in which you have to meet a certain quota of jobs applied for and you have to take an interview from the first job you get regardless if you like it or not. 

But what often happens is that they apply for these jobs, get the interview, either purposely fuck over the interview or they'll get the job and purposely do bad shit in order to get fired. 

Now what I'd do is if you get a job you have to remain at said job for a certain set of time. If you happen to lose said job then you must wait an entire month or maybe more if I'm being an asshole from when you lost your job to when you can apply for unemployment. 

This way it prevents folks from just purposely getting fired from their job just to get back on benefits as they'll be without money and income for 1 or 2 months. It'd be a sure fine way to lose money if you kept trying this shit. 

Folks who are on unemployment for genuine reasons will find the first job they can get and stay in said job, those folks who are good won't be on unemployment for long thereby reducing overall cost of that benefit system while maximising the amount of people going to return. 

&#x200B;

My hope is that this would save much more money thus allowing the people who desperately need benefits to actually receive said benefits. As for disabilities it's tricky but again in the UK people exploit this as well. 

Suppose the simple solution to this would be a monitored health check, not just a Doctor's note or some shit, as much as that would suck it would essentially weed out the people who don't have genuine disabilities or at least if they do have a disability we can determine how major or mild it is and see how that affects their ability to work. As often enough they're still perfectly capable of working. 

Single or struggling parents you don't really need much to prove. If both parents are working and they're struggling financially then it's quite obvious that they need help so hopefully with my suggest changes said parents can get the support they need. 

I'd much rather my tax money go towards the wellbeing and development of raising a child than the dregs of society who leech of the good people of this nation. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, that's my opinion of welfare and benefits and while I agree with people needing help it's so fundamentally flawed that it's in need of major reforms. 

I don't believe wiping out welfare entirely would benefit people or society as a whole, I just believe it will only create more problems than what you're trying to solve. 

But maybe you can give an argument as to why removing welfare entirely would be beneficial for society.",Conservative

"Read as much communist and socialist literature as you can I don't really comment or browse this sub because a lot of you are troublesome and there's not much good content here, but I just wanted to urge all of you to read up on as much communist literature as you can.

The more popular it becomes, the less popular common sense against their arguments and proposals become. Most of these communists haven't read or comprehended any of this socialist crap, or know the history of it. Those that do are doing their best to muddy the waters with lies and accusations of lies on the part of people who uncover the atrocities caused by socialist regimes.

Whether we like it or not, socialism is on the rise in the developed world. The opposition to socialism and economic literacy are also on the rise, but that isn't going to lower the risk of socialist sabotage of general freedoms, whether that sabotage is purposeful or not.

As far as truth goes, this isn't an equal battle. The truth is heavily stacked in our favor. Being able to communicate that fact without bias towards our beliefs is what will show that the truth is on our side. As of right now, superior argumentation and the mainstreaming of the arguments against socialism is the best way to get the average Joe to understand the dangers of it.

Become a professional in communist literature and talking points and the arguments against them, for the sake of the millions who have died under these regimes. Explaining basic economics only goes so far to people who won't listen or don't care. Learn their methods and the dishonesty and fallacies of their arguments, and let it be known to people who haven't been indoctrinated yet.

"Dismantling Das Kapital, Day 1, Part 1. Today I take the first step on a long campaign. How successful it will be, and whether I change even one mind is anyone's guess.   
Reading the title, you can already guess what these posts will be about, but you're likely asking what the larger goal is.   
Communism is a utopian philosophy turned dystopic. Every iteration of communism in history fails in incredible fashion. However, like Phil Swift slapping Flex Tape on a leaking water tank communist apologists spout ""...but that wasn't *REAL* communism. Communism is stateless. Those facts are skewed by Capitalist propaganda.""   
Worse, their arguments almost always end or begin with a link to some article right here on reddit. Usually they're heaping piles of mush. Academically and Intellectually lazy diatribes consistent of meandering condemnation of capitalism and trite platitudes about communism.   
Sadly these...dissertations...are mistaken for educated, meaningful content because of their lofty rhetoric and use of buzzwords/phrases. However, any critical analysis of these droll posts betrays the reality that Most *communists* are entirely unread on communist philosophy.   
Well, as a proud capitalist swine, I too am largely unread on communist philosophy. While that comes partly rom my general opposition to ingesting intellectual junk, it's also because each time I start to read a communist manifesto or philosophy it's simply such trash I cannot bring myself to finish it.   


However, to get through to these quasi-scholarly Zoomers of TikTok and Twitter, I am going to painstakingly read and unpack Communist Literature and Manifestos. I will illustrate how it is intellectually disingenuous, academically lazy, and hopefully bring some minds back to reality.  


I fully believe one must go big or go home, so I am starting with the ponderous tome ""*Das Kapital""* or *""Capital""*  by Karl Marx. If you're a communist and wish to serve up another manifest or philosophy, please: send it my way and I'll get to it...I'm not sure when. *Capital* may take a while. 

Here's why I'm at least worth the read, for you skeptics:   
I have a degree in Philosophy, so I can unpack and understand complex and novel thought.   
I have a JD and am licensed to practice law in \[a State\] so I understand how to (1) set aside subjective impressions in favor of an objective interpretation and (2) I know how to thoroughly research where I fall sort. 

My goal is to do some cognizable section (depending on the text that could be a chapter, part, book, etc.) each week. This will be fairly real-time. If you wish to engage, it will be most fresh on my mind when I finish the post.

Here are 11 questions you can ask Libertarians to see if they’re hypocrites ,Conservative
"Minimum wage increases do not cause inflation. It’s the other way around. Inflation is not caused by the increase of minimum wage. Inflation is strictly caused by the increase of money in circulation. When the federal reserve prints more money, inflation is a byproduct. Money adheres to the principle of scarcity. More money = less scarcity = lower value.

But it’s understandable why people still dislike minimum wage increases. Usually, they indicate that inflation is hitting the market. In a scarce market with finite cash, minimum wage will stay the same. Unless people in higher paying jobs take a pay cut for minimum wage to go up, minimum wage will stay the same. 

If a flood of newly-printed money comes along, inflation hits. The value of the dollar goes down and your salary now has less purchasing power. It’s necessary to adjust your pay for inflation to assure that your purchasing power is where it was at before inflation occurred. If you could afford a $3 muffin before inflation, but now muffins are $5, your salary should be increased such that you can still afford the $5 muffin. 

Same goes for minimum wage. The minimum wage should (and will) be increased so that people who make minimum wage can afford what they could afford before inflation hit. 

People seem to associate inflation with minimum wage because minimum wage is the only widely-known wage standard out there, and inflation hits around the same time that minimum wage goes up. But as you now see from above, minimum wage increases aren’t a cause of inflation, rather an effect. 

Side note: the visibility of minimum wage, I’d hypothesize, has an impact on the cost of living adjustment during inflationary periods. People don’t like to see minimum wage go up because they associate it with inflation. So of course, it’s a public matter that is often a hot topic of debate. Minimum wage, in some areas, may not be adjusted appropriately for inflation. That’s why you may see people advocating for seemingly high spikes in how much minimum wage should be. It’s possible that inflation has significantly outpaced minimum wage for a given state, and is in desperate need of updating. At the end of the day, increasing minimum wage is not a byproduct of wanting to give too much credit to people who do “the minimum” for society—it’s a byproduct of reckless government spending which results in the federal reserve printing more and more US dollars, resulting in inflation that changes the value of the dollars we all have in our pockets.",Conservative

"Why is it common for libertarians to align with Republicans? I've considered myself a libertarian since senior year in high school (about to be 26 in a few days) but I've never aligned or supported most views of Republicans. I'm all for a smaller government and I'm all for personal freedoms, but it seems recently libertarians started choosing sides between liberals and conservatives and a lot along with conservatives since they're always publicly scrutinizing the governments role with the pandemic. 

I'm all for masks, I'm all for vaccines, because I understand this is needed in order to better the livelihoods of everyone, not only worried about myself and what I want. We as humans are not individually able to make a working system to combat this and that's obvious considering it's 2 years already and we're practically in square one. 

Not going to argue about this tho. It's pointless and it isn't the point. My question is why do a lot of us align ourselves with these conspiracy theory conservatives that are judgemental about anything and everything, while also commonly not accepting anything that doesnt align with their ideologies and limited world experience? I mean half of these conservatives (being moderate) have racial views or a lack of racial awareness and understanding. A lot of them are actively and public racist. A lot of them are even starting to don racial flags/sayings ynser the guise of conservatism. 

Don't tread on me? That has always been a racial thing until adopted by the libertarian party. Why did we adopt a flag with such a deep racial background? By doing that you're aligning yourself with the racist south protesting government involvement and the racist state rights to own slaves. This is what we're really aligning ourselves with?? Really?? 

To be honest I don't choose a political party often. I believe in things from democracy, libertarian, even Marxism and communism. But I just can't understand why we so often support and help conservatives? Conversatives don't truly support or like freedom any more than democrats and that's obvious. And no I don't support liberals either. They are doing some crazy shit to this society. However a lot of them are vastly more open minded and push for freedom than a republican does.

"Are trade imbalances benign? A big theme amongst libertarians, neoconservatives, and their friends is that free trade is great for everyone. If this is the case, then there is no need to worry about trade imbalances between the US and other countries. 

But if these trade imbalances make no difference, why do other countries work so hard to ensure their own trade surpluses? Germany and China provide excellent examples. Are they simply wasting their energy, or do they know something that we don’t know? 

A common refrain among Americans is that no one cares about the trade imbalances between Massachusetts and California. The assumption is that the money will come back one way or another. But this reminds me of the fallacious martingale gambling fallacy. If you keep doubling your bet every time you lose, you’ll be sure to recoup your losses, because at an infinite number of games your probability of winning reaches 1. Problem is, between now and infinity you lose your money. 

So eventually we do recoup the trade imbalance one way or another. But the problem is, between now and then, we may lose our country.",Conservative
"Shattering the marxian zero-sum Victimology fallacy. Wealth acquired legitimately is nothing to be guilty of.you're not taking advantage over someone if you spend something that was obtained from fair trade. its actually a moral dimension at play,not an economic one. you see,charity manifests in so many ways,not merely by generous giving without reciprocal returns. in a freemarket,charity takes place when input demanded is output supplied. and a series of that process is what responsible for all the wealth a society accumulates for progress. the system doesnt seek to eliminate poverty. it only provides means to lift people away from it. we cant get rid of absolute poverty because it is a constant state. however,relative poverty is self evidently fixable. for an instance,poor people in the US are middle class people in some poor asian nation such as the philippines. Middle class people in the philippines are rich people in some remote indigenous tribe like the congos. and we can reduce the threshold of  absolute poverty for everybody to improve our quality of life 

Never listen to commies who peddle a zero-sum setting where one's win is other's loss. that's not how life works.this is the reason why they have to resort to victimology to advance their case.",Conservative

"On the minimum wage Hello all. For context, I’m a leftist (not a liberal). Not exactly a fan of unregulated capitalism as I see the entire system as greedy and exploitive. Didn’t come here to antagonize y’all though, just wanted to exchange ideas.

With that said, I’m curious as to what you all think is an acceptable minimum wage? Not a number per se, but the quality of life that it’s meant to sustain. 

When FDR first introduced this, it was meant to actually be a *livable* wage - https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938. Of course this means you should be able to feed yourself and have a roof over your head at the very least without working 4 different jobs. 

It seems today that many believe that for example, the giant fast food corporations don’t need to pay workers sufficiently for their labor because it’s “not a real job” or “it’s for teens/high school students”. It seems to me that from a capitalist perspective, cutting corners when compensating your workers is just a means to maximize your profit, which is a core tenet of capitalism. (See: chattel slavery, child labor, sweatshops). I believe that if you can’t pay your employees a livable wage, *in most cases* you probably shouldn’t be in business. 

I’ve worked many jobs from grocery stores to warehouses. Many of my coworkers had multiple jobs and were *still* struggling. What are your thoughts?",Conservative

Strangely enough Marx was the first to see this. He is the one who informed us, looking backwards, that the evolution of private capitalism with its free market had been a precondition for the evolution of all our democratic freedoms. It never occurred to him, looking forward, that if this was so, these other freedoms might disappear with the abolition of the free market.""

"Are there any Austrian economic groups that are NOT full of shit I can’t think of one that actually cares about the truth. The most referenced one I can think of is the FEE. I know the FEE isn’t a real economics group because much of the stuff they say are low effort attempts to benefit shareholders. One example would be the analysis they did on how rich Jeff Bezos was.

The claim made was that Bezos is not rich because most of his wealth is just non liquid shares in various companies. Saying he only makes $87,000/yr and that means he is middle class. Anyone who has invested in the stock market knows shares can be sold for real money and last year he sold $2 billion dollars worth of shares. He underspecs his income so he can pay less in capital gains.

Even if you didn’t understand the practice of financial investing, you can SEE that he clearly built a personal fortune. He owns 5 mansions, a warehouse full of rare luxury cars and a fucking rocket ship.

"Thomas Sowell on Freedom ""The growth of the decision making powers of government may facilitate various specific forms of material progress – even if at the expense of material progress in general – while reducing freedom. That trade-off needs to be made explicit. It is instead muddied over by those who define freedom as options (freedom to) – and who have many options to promise in exchange for our freedom. The options approach asks, “What freedom does a starving man have?” The answer is that starvation is a tragic human condition – perhaps more tragic than loss of freedom. That does not prevent these from being two different things. No matter what ranking may be given to such disagreeable things as indebtedness and constipation, a laxative will not get you out of debt and a pay raise will not insure “regularity.” Conversely on a list of desirable things, gold may rank higher than peanut butter, but you cannot spread gold on a sandwich and eat it for nourishment. The false issue of ranking things cannot be allowed to confuse questions of distinguishing things.""

Basically the US tax rate would be cut to a 5% income tax and property tax while increasing the minimum wage to 20 dollars an hour.

Most people would say that with the increase in wages the price of goods and services would increase but if the government were to use regulatory powers keeping prices at the same rate before the change in wages.

""This episode is an attempt to wrest control from an independent agency’s chairman with a change in the administration. More than that, it’s an example of the erosion of America’s democracy. Many government institutions are built on norms and practices that encourage parties to work together. This foundation depends on agency leaders who recognize that the long-term benefits of cooperation outweigh the short-term incentive to blow up institutions in pursuit of immediate partisan gains. Since the FDIC’s founding in 1933, all 72 board members have respected that foundation. Until now. 

When I arrived in the U.S. from Yugoslavia alone on my 18th birthday, I had $500 in my pocket. I came to this country with a firm belief in a system of government built upon the rule of law. In the old country, those in power all too often changed the rules and circumvented protocols to enact their preferred policies. When I was sworn in as chairman, I promised myself that I would lead the FDIC with deliberation and due care.""

Democrats hold a majority on the board, and with board member Martin Gruenberg now set to take over as acting chair, they have sway at the top. Gruenberg has spoken out against the deregulatory actions taken over the past several years at the Federal Reserve that also have drawn sharp criticism from firebrand Sen.

"Is this war going to be acceptable because Joe Biden started it? After Biden’s botched exit from the Middle East, I thought we as a society could have overwhelmingly agreed it was a hiccup on Biden’s behalf. 

Instead, people defended the action by claiming we needed to get out and there is no need for war. This thread was no different. People said the US should mind their own business. It’s a Libertarian thing to do. 

However, as we are on the brink of war with Russia due to incompetence in leadership on behalf of the US and Ukraine, people suddenly seem to have a thirst for war. Or at least no qualms with it. 

**”It’s different.””** or **”The Libertarian thing to do is defend Ukraine.**

I under the argument: laziness as an end rather than a mean *is* a virtue, because you strive to be lazy and will create, invent, and innovate to make life easier, so you can be lazy down the line. That’s certainly more of a virtue, especially if it enables *more* to be lazy. Capitalism is trending towards this virtue as automation develops over time.

But the more common encounter of laziness is as a mean, and *that* is a vice. It prevents you from creating, inventing, and innovating. You choose to do nothing instead of something. That’s not of high moral standard. Happiness, in itself, is a “being-at-work” state. You must strive and work for happiness. Laziness is the polar opposite, wherein you do *nothing*.

"Mirror mirror on the wall..... “The West is promising ""massive"" sanctions on Moscow in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But any action that affects Russia's energy interests will highlight the role played by some of the West's biggest players, which have generated billions of dollars for the Russian state and are among the country's leading foreign investors. Here's how ExxonMobil (XOM), BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA) are helping keep Russia's oil-dependent economy afloat.”

ExxonMobil

The American oil giant has more than 1,000 employees in Russia, and has been in the country for over 25 years. Its subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), has a 30% stake in Sakhalin-1 — a vast oil and natural gas project located off Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. It has operated the project since 1995 on behalf of a consortium that includes Japanese and Indian partners, as well as two affiliates of Russia's largest oil company,

Shell

Shell says Sakhalin-2 supplies about 4% of the world's current LNG market. Japan, South Korea and China are the main customers for oil and LNG exports. A Shell spokesperson said it was monitoring the situation closely, but declined to comment on the company's investments in Russia.

BP

On its website, BP proclaims itself ""one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia."" BP also owns 49% of Yermak Neftegaz — formed in 2016 — which is conducting onshore exploration over a combined area of about 260,000 square kilometers in the West Siberian and Yenisey-Khatanga basins. The third joint venture covers the Kharampur project, in which BP has a 49% interest. Kharampur is a mature oil field but BP and Rosneft are planning to develop the project to pump gas. BP says there is potential to ""double overall field production."" BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Need help understanding capitalism. For a long time I was a socialist a long time ago who pretty much was in this deep rabbit hole of communism and how every single thing about capitalism is bad and etc. but now I’m looking to understand it a lot more, possibly even become in favour of it. I’m gonna present some arguments against capitalism made by communists in the past. Don’t be too harsh, these are just honest topics. 

1. Capitalism will inevitably collapse due to its own conditions and contradictions.

Apparently the left likes to say capitalism will just wither away and die out basically because of the state having too much power. Or.. there’ll be a revolution (which in my opinion is silly to say for a communist because they never work for anything and wait)

2. The only way workers can get rid of alienation is by owning the means of production. 

This made sense. Workers own how their products get controlled but a capitalist response I once heard was you can just buy stocks (pretty vague) if anyone would like to add on that.

3. Capitalism has a false relationship with meritocracy

Communists say only in their regime hard work gets rewarded. 

4. Taxing the rich

>If bill gates got taxed 70% of his net worth the healthcare system would only be benefited for 16 days only.

5. Capitalism leads to starvation, homelessness and extreme levels of inflation and unemployment.

6. Communism is a prosperous society where you have a planned economy that benefits everyone",Conservative

"Libertarians have been warning about inflation since 2008. Why has it taken so long for inflation to kick in? After the 2008 recession the Fed lowered interest rates to 0% and started quantitative easing. Many libertarians claimed that this would result in substantial inflation. Yet, many years passed, and no inflation was evident. However, inflation has started roaring in the last year, and many libertarians feel vindicated.

What doesn't make sense to me is why it took 12 years for inflation to kick in. Of course many non-libertarians are still claiming that the current inflation is transitory or due to supply chain issues and not related to the actions of the fed at all.

On the other hand I used to live in an apartment when out of nowhere the apartment below me became an Airbnb, and every now and again hosted groups of young people putting loud music and partying till the small hours, because they’re tourists so wtf do they care that I have work the next day. We ended up leaving because we couldn’t take it anymore.

So I can’t imagine buying a flat and all the sudden an apartment next to you becomes Airbnb, another one becomes a clinic and another one maybe a weed club or what not. We can say “don’t like it?

"Comparing Covid lockdowns To Laws Against Drink Driving Is A False Equivalency 1: Laws against drink driving do no violate established civil liberties. They do not impact freedom of expression, freedom of movement, the right to a speedy trial, the right to be free from searches without a warrant or the right to work. The same can't be said about lockdowns.

2: Laws against drink driving are limited in scope. They only require somebody to refrain from drink driving. Lockdowns impact most if not all aspects of a person's life. They impact the person both socially and economically and in so many other ways.

3: Laws against drink driving do not cause harm. Although not being able to drive home while drunk may be annoying, the benefits of not driving home drunk absolutely outweigh downsides. Lockdowns cause widespread harm to society including social, psychological and economic harm. This harm disproportionately harms the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of society.

4: Laws against drink driving achieve their intended purpose. Laws against drink driving do in fact save lives and are supported by science. Lockdowns save little to no lives and are not backed by science. Every pandemic plan prior to covid-19 opposed lockdowns and current studies are showing that they have slim to none impact on saving lives from covid-19.

5: It is more difficult to use laws against drink driving as a political weapon. Lockdown rules can easily be used to target and shut down political groups and movements. This is seen in both third world countries and in western countries as well. For example, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews shutting down the entire construction industry to punish them for a protest and the Chinese government using covid restrictions to restrict the travel of political dissidents.

6: Laws against drink driving are proportional to the threat of drunk drivers and there doesn't seem to be any viable alternatives to laws against drink drivers. Lockdowns are disproportionate to the threat of covid-19. Although covid-19 can make people from some demographics very sick, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the average person. We also have some vaccines that can reduce the severity of the disease. Focused protection is not just a viable alternative to lockdowns, it also saves lives unlike lockdowns.",Conservative

"Find the flaw in this plan Idea for a game. Thinking in terms of realism, is there any flaw in this plan?

1) Someone creates a set of laws for a hypothetical minarchist state – zero taxes, complete freedom, extremely harsh sentences for criminals, etc

2) They create a company which people can buy stocks in

3) The goal of the company is to buy an island and create a LARP'ing environment where libertarians can pretend to have their own state

4) They scout out fitting islands that are privately owned, and buys one of them

5) With the funds from the stocks, they build a couple of underground silos on the island – one for housing, with many ""apartments"", and one which houses LARP'ing courts, prison cells, a hypothetical but non-producing gold currency factory, etc. They also buy a lot of long-storage food.

6) Many people ""go on vacation"" to this island, to LARP

7) The remaining funds are used to buy gold

8) Through underground channels, they are able to quickly buy and transfer a nice arsenal of weapons to this island, and declare it to be a new nation, which would never attack anyone, but only defend itself against any hypothetical invasion (this would ensure that there's not much of a pretext for invading the island. Governments will of course want to do it, but how do they convince the man in the street and the average soldier that this is justified?)

9) Later, the gold-rich inhabitants and investors can come together and build a large gravity-based structure next to the island (like those supporting oil platforms), strong enough to withstand waves and attacks, and high enough to withstand tsunamis. On the top of this, one would built a flat platform, and divide it into private properties according to who put in the most money. And the places on top of pillars might be more expensive, since they can support skyscrapers, etc.

Thus, a free state is built. Thoughts?",Conservative

"I think my Girlfriend may be an anacap? So my girlfriend votes Democrat. And initially I thought she was a standard liberal which me (being somewhere in between libertarian and conservative) tried to change. She seemed to smart to be a liberal.

So I started to ask her questions about why she supported the Democrats and listed a litany of reasons of why she shouldn't. But then she said something that blew my mind. It went a bit like this:

The United States is too far gone to save or salvage. We won't have a good country until it fails and we have to start over again. I vote for the Democrats because A) I support things like gay marriage and abortion but also B) Because I think that the Democrat's financial policy will more quickly bring about the end of the US government. And until the US gov't as we know it ends we will never have a shot to rebuild it into something that won't become a huge mess. Republican's talk about starving the beast, I think the beast is too large and too connected to starve. I think the beast must be defeated by overfeeding it and letting it die from it's on largess.

"Who are the REAL Corporate shills? The real corporate shills aren't libertarians and ancaps, but the anti-corporatist liberals and leftists.  They are the *perfect* shills, because they have no idea that their efforts against corporations is just making the corps stronger and more powerful.  

Corporations were created by governments.  Corporations have special privileges and protections from governments.  ""Crony Capitalism"" (Crapitalism!) is all about government doing things on behalf of the corporations, corporate welfare, and legislation to protect corporations from competition.  

The anti-corporatists, while strangely recognizing that corporations influence, subvert, and control government, somehow think that the solution is to give the government MORE power over society, and then government will SOMEHOW be able to resist the influence and subversion by corporations, and thus allow government to control corporations.  Because being able to vote somehow makes government accountable to ""the people"".  Not that that's provided much accountability up to this point.  But it will somehow work better in the future. 

In fact, giving the government more power merely means giving the corporations more power over government, and makes their influence and subversion even more powerful over the rest of society.  

See?  Perfect shills!

There are some few corporations that support libertarianism (cough, Koch Brothers, cough), but the great majority of corporations do NOT support libertarianism.  More importantly, NO corporation, not even the Koch Brothers, really favor the end of government and the creation of an anarchist society.  And for good reason. 

Corporations are dependent upon government for the vast powers they exercise.  Without government privileges and protections, and without the governmental power structure, Corporations have little choice other than to compete for consumers on an equal footing with other businesses.  The large corporate structure and bureaucracy becomes a hindrance without government protectionism.  Corporations would not only NOT become all-powerful in a market anarchist society, it's possible that they may not even be able to exist!

And then there are people who are so confused that they think that corporations using government for their corporate agenda is somehow equivalent to anarcho-capitalism and radical free marketeering.  Not only are they perfect corporate shills, but they don't even realize how they're undermining their own argument for more government controls and regulations!",Conservative

Now it could be said that the freedoms of person y would be limited because of the actions of person x, but this could only so far as a positive or modified sense, as person y actions are inherently reliant of the actions of person x.

If we were to force person x to do business with person y than we could say person y regain his modified freedom, however person x's own freedom is now limited.

"Capitalists, government and the free market From what i have seen, most people believe that capitalists are pro free market and against government intervention. This, on paper, seems very logical, capitalists would want a free market so they can freely do what they want and no government to interfere and holding them back.

Though i believe that this notion is only valid at the beginning. After the capitalists have become big enough with enough reach, influence and wealth, the free market no longer seems like a good option.  Why choose to let others compete with you when you can keep yourself on top forever? Capitalists, i believe would opt for preservation of their position, even if it means making the market less free.

One way they could do this is through the government by lobbying. The government, politicians would not be able to be partial because in the end, the one paying their bills and putting them in their seats are the wealthy, those with influence and power. The capitalists would always have power to influence the government and why wouldn't they use it to their advantage? The way i see it, the government would always lean toward the capitalists regardless of which side of the aisle they are on. 

All in all, capitalists prefer the free market for themselves but not others because that is the best way to maximize profit and they can do so through the government. That is why i believe the notion that capitalists are pro-free market and anti-government is not true.",Conservative

"Capitalism can and will work without socialism,but the latter won't work without the former. Socialism  is a redistribution system not a wealth creation system. its purpose ends after it equally redistributed wealth. Take beff Jezos and all billionaires on earth for instance. converting all his wealth into liquid asset and redistributing it will induce hyperinflation. all people are millionaires but one piece of candy is worth millions too. So you did not create wealth when you redistribute it. you can't multiply wealth by dividing it. Redistributing all the wealth is basically turning the World into one huge venezuela.This is one of the reason why commies/socies aim to abolish money. to abolish money is to abolish the pricing system and to abolish the pricing system is to eventually get rid of markets. to get rid of markets is to get rid of supply and demand. in a market capitalist economy. a Monopoly is a function of demand. while in a communist utopia. a monopoly is a function of supply with no reference to demand. it means the state will produce out of impulse with no reference to demand and they will consume with no reference to supply leading to catastrophy. This is why communism/socialism is impossible.

"America (and some other countries) have an exploitation problem, but I'm tired of seeing capitalism defined by these problems (details inside) I believe every country (especially first world ones) should strive to allow anyone working 40 hours a week, regardless of which job, a certain standard of living. I think anyone contributing this much time to a wealthy country should be able to afford standard necessities. Such necessities in my mind include a house, medical care, food, water, utilities. America is currently on the border of this, with many workers not being able to afford all the things above. The problem for America comes down to corporations opting to spend their profits each year on expansion, rather than employee pay. I'm not going to give my opinion on a solution, but to me, that seems to be the core of the problem. And if you think this isn't a problem, look around. It's not a few dozen workers, it's the whole country, throwing a fit. Psychology of the masses works on input/output, and if there's enough people lashing out, there's an underlying problem that needs addressing.

But, capitalism isn't a form of government. It's an economic policy, and I'm tired of the two being interchanged.

Capitalism works so well and is so fundamental, many people don't even realize what it is. If a country allows people to run their own business, it has a capitalism based monetary policy. Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Japan, S. Korea, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, America, Taiwan, Vietnam, South Africa, China, Russia. All capitalist.

"Tales of America health care ……or How to make a terrible health care system into something worse. So instead of acknowledging that decades of pinching pennies and cutting corners led to this chaotic juncture and course-correcting by sacrificing future profits to permanently increase capacity, major health care companies have opted for a more predictable response. They’ve united with venture capital and Silicon Valley in a depressingly on-brand pivot to the gig economy.

Saving money on labor, regardless of the outcome for workers and patients, is the name of the game in hospital management. It’s how we got into this mess to begin with. And it seems the responsible parties know better than to let a good crisis go to waste.

Companies like CareRev and its competitors — ShiftMed, Trusted Health, Nomad Health, connectRN — are raising tens of millions of dollars in venture capital investment because they provide value to their customers. But their customers are not the health care workers who want to earn a living on their platforms. Their actual customers are for-profit hospitals desperate to cut labor costs.

The ultimate problem is that it treats workers and patients as little more than inputs in a system designed to generate profit.

First, who decides what money is good? I know a lot of AnCaps like BitCoin. Is it consensus that BitCoin will be the global valuta in AnCap utopia? What was the generally accepted idea before crypto-currency came along? Will there also be physical money, and if so, who gets to print it?



Secondly, how does an AnCap society deal with orphans? This can be both children whose parents give them away, or perhaps children of single mothers-to-be who die at birth. Are they supposed to just start working as soon as they leave the womb, is it consensus that kids below X years are taken care of by someone, or what?



Thirdly, (and i know i might reveal my lack of research on this one, bear with me) who maintains the non-agression principle? Do you have other options in case of an attack than utilizing your gun, or your hired mercenaries? 



I hope you will keep a friendly tone, and thank you in advance for the answers.",Conservative

"Wondering how Libertarians feel about school choice from a different angle than what’s been talked about lately..? So to go along with the title.. I graduated roughly 12 years ago now and I’ll say that in the schools I went to my parents had a lot of choice in MY education. 

Back when I was in school we learned about alot of things that I’ve come to realize aren’t taught in most American schools as freely as it is where I live. We had pretty extensive sexual education that covered anatomy, sexually transmitted disease, intercourse, contraceptives, sexual orientation, gender reassignment… the list probably goes on and on. We learned about the Holocaust and the way Hitler rose to power through nationalism. We learned about things like the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Daughters of the Confederacy, Jim Crow, just general acts of suppression in the US. 

We read books that had  subjects that dealt with sexual assault, murder, racism, genocide, incest, religion, lack of religion, pro religion, anti religion… basically everything people think now should be a parental right to remove from curriculum. 

I learned about social issues that gave me different perspectives than my parents were teaching me. I learned about different things like living with disabilities, living as a homosexual during the Stonewall Era, and other subjects people don’t see fit for school. 

You know what schools did back then? Gave us a sheet to take home that said “Next week we will be dealing with X subject that may cause concern for some parents. Please sign below if you approve of your child seeing this material, if not your child will be placed in a different classroom while this material is given” If your parents didn’t approve you would go to another class where you’d get tutoring help with other subjects, be able to read, sometimes even physical activity would be the replacement like team sports or something. 

Overall this choice kept school informative to so many people and parents were still able to keep their children away from subjects they didn’t believe.


So I’m wondering if this system is unique to my area or if the topic has just shifted to just banning these things altogether vs on a case by case basis?Do you think that school is not only for Math and English but also for teaching kids how society functions good and bad? Thank you for reading and look forward to hearing your perspectives!",Conservative

"US Rep. Swalwell Suggests Kicking Russians Out of US Universities But Ignores Chinese in US Universities Stealing US Knowledge and Research Used in Development of COVID-19 By Joe Hoft

Published February 25, 2022 at 8:00am

&#x200B;

Democrat US Congressman Eric Swalwell from California suggests that Russian students should be removed from US universities but he for some reason has never suggested the same for Chinese students. 

FOXNews reported on Swalwell’s interview on CNN:

&#x200B;

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said on CNN Thursday that kicking Russian students out of U.S. universities should be “on the table” in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin launching an invasion into Ukraine.

&#x200B;

“Frankly, I think closing their embassy in the United States, kicking every Russian student out of the United States … should … be on the table. … Vladimir Putin needs to know every day that he is in Ukraine, there are more severe options that could come,” Swalwell said on “CNN Newsroom.”

&#x200B;

The congressman added that other retaliatory actions should be sanctioning Putin personally and “completely” removing Russians from SWIFT, an international banking system that facilitates financial transactions between banks globally.

&#x200B;

Shockingly, Swalwell never suggested that same after the Chinese released COVID on the world.  We have reported that the knowledge, research and development, and money used to develop COVID and build China’s bioweapons expertise was paid in large part by the US and US universities.

&#x200B;

There may be reasons to address Russians in US universities but to discount the massive infiltration of Chinese in US universities who bring back to China billions in knowledge, training, and state of the art knowledge in multiple industries.  There is a good reason why Swalwell will never address this – because he is compromised.

&#x200B;

Swalwell was caught sleeping with a Chinese spy and yet he still holds a position on the Intel Committee in Congress.

&#x200B;

The problem with the US is that crooks like Eric Swalwell are not held accountable for their corrupt actions.  So when they make statements about anything, they leave a question of doubt due to their prior actions and no one knows if they are responding in good faith or based on their conflicts.",Conservative

Google parent Alphabet’s 22 deals, Microsoft’s 56 deals and Amazon’s 29 deals in 2021 were all 10-year highs, according to Dealogic. While Dealogic data only accounts for publicly disclosed deal values, based on those records, Alphabet and Microsoft’s aggregate deal volumes were also at 10-year highs, at $22 billion and $25.7 billion, respectively. Amazon’s total deal volume, at $15.7 billion, just missed a 10-year high, trailing only 2017, when it agreed to buy Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.

"It's not an act of war They come without uniforms.  They attack the unprepared in places they think themselves safe.  They shoot and bomb the places where the innocent body count will be highest.

Terrorism is not war, and war is not terrorism.  War requires the courage to face armed adversaries, fully prepared for the reality of being shot and killed for your beliefs.  Terrorism cannot be answered by the state, even retribution is impossible, because the perpetrators of terrorist acts almost never survive, and do not value life even if they did.

The **ONLY** thing that would make this whole mess less tragic is if it could somehow be undone - to lower the body count of the innocent.  The past can't be changed, but these events aren't done unfolding.  There will be more of them.

No policy will unwind the hate from the vile fundamentalist mind, nor stop them from arming themselves and finding their way into your local shopping mall, your kids' schools, your coffee shops, your churches and synagogues .  Policy can't do fuck-all about them, and neither can police.  These acts are calculated to happen in the places where people feel the most safe, where they are not on their guard, where the first responders will *always* be too late to prevent an urgent hardship from becoming a tragedy.  **That is the very point.**

Calling this ""an act of war"" is a feeble abstraction that makes it sound like there's some front to which we can march an army, away from the place where we can leave our precious and delicate loved ones safely behind, in homes that the enemy would never be able to reach.  But there is not.  The enemy defines the front, and that front is *where you least expect it.*

The version of the events in France which, while still awful, is nevertheless *distinguishably superior* to the savage tragedy we've all just witnessed, is the version where the well armed citizens of Paris shoot back at these vicious animals and put them down on the spot.  Guns in the hands of the ethical.

Gun control, and the cultivated culture of abnegating responsibility for personal security onto the police, the state, and anyone else is as much to blame for the scale of this awful catastrophe as the savage, regressive, hateful, inhuman shit-soup of Muhammed's chosen assholes.

So stop calling this an act of war.  The state is powerless to oppose it.  We must all act as the white blood cells of society to root out the infection of ideological violence.

In closing, **fuck ISIS.**",Conservative

"As a Canadian this is the first time i've gotten to see firsthand the power of ""fake new"" and misinformation. It's kind of scary. It's wild seeing what American news media are doing with the events of our country. We are seeing borderline comical levels of over exaggeration mixed in with outright lies.

The vast, vast majority of Canadians support some of the ideas of the convoy but absolutely do not support how they went about it. Blocking people from working and living their lives is simply not ok. Blasting loud noise 24/7 in residential areas, not ok. Blocking ambulances and flooding 911 lines, not ok. These violate the informal NAP that Canadians hold dear. The government wronging you absolutely does not give you the right to turn around and harm others.

\- The emergency act is highly controversial. Obviously.  Unfortunately the Ontario provincial government has an upcoming election and decided it was a good strategy to leave Ottawa high and dry while they did help out in Windsor. The federal government cannot tell local police what to do without the emergency act.

\- Freezing bank accounts is very standard. Any time your account gets flagged for potential criminal activity it will get frozen and investigated. I've had mine frozen a few times when I add big chunks of money that are from unfamiliar sources. All they did was add crowdfunding sites to the list of regulated sources.

\- France breaks out tear gas on children on day 1 and you hear crickets. A horses bumps some people after a 3 week occupation and suddenly we all live in concentration camps under the reincarnation of Hitler? During the G20 summit there was 1000x the police aggression and...crickets. Why is this being targeted so heavily by America media?

In Canada it is an indictable offence to compel “another person to abstain from doing anything that he or she has a lawful right to do, or to do anything that he or she has a lawful right to abstain from doing.”

We intend to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay based on these circumstances,” Apple said in a statement.

         The fact remains: “it should be their choice,”   Judge Gonzalez Rogers wrote. 

But she expressed concern that Apple was keeping consumers in the dark about alternative payment methods and ordered Apple to lift its ban on in-app links, buttons and messages to users about other ways to pay.

Apple has appealed the judge’s ruling, asking her to pause her orders while the appeals process plays out, which could take several years.

"Suggestions for a newcomer and someone who wants to learn about and understand more about Libertarianism? Young American here. I’m genuinely fed up with the in-fighting and bullshit of the last 8 years, I’ve never felt represented by any delegates of either the Republican or Democratic parties. My introduction to voting and politics in general was in 2016 and it’s been a rather tumultuous relationship with politics ever since, I never felt implored to learn more about either parties because I felt disinterested and turned off by aspects of both of their socio-political ideologies and the various garbage fires both administrations have started.

However, I feel implored to learn more about libertarianism because of my base level understanding of this parties philosophies. I’m fed up with our 2 party system, I value individual freedoms, autonomy and endorse the idea of drug decriminalization. I want to learn more about this party and it’s philosophies as much as possible moving forward so I’m able to participate in discussions and know what I’m talking about instead of just calling myself a libertarian without really fully understanding the party and having just a bare minimum amount of knowledge.

I guess what I’m asking is what books, websites, news outlets or other sources would you recommend as starting points or ways to build my knowledge? I know I could start my own research and I have to some extent but it feels like there’s an endless sea of information and I’d love some recommendations on sort of “must know” types of information!

His voice rose: ""Oh God, who is--"" and broke off.

""-- John Galt?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" he said, and shook his head as if to dispel some vision, ""only I don't like to say that.""

""I don't, either. I wish I knew why people are saying it and who started it.""

""That's it, ma'am. That's what I'm afraid of. It might have been me who started it.""

""What?""

""Me or about six thousand others. We might have. I think we did. I hope we're wrong.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well, there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for twenty years. It was when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody -- almost everybody -- voted for it. We didn't know. We thought it was good. No, that's not true, either. We thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid according to his need. We -- what's the matter, ma'am? Why do you look like that?""

""What was the name of the factory?"" she asked, her voice barely audible.

""The Twentieth Century Motor Company, ma'am, of Starnesville, Wisconsin.""

""Go on.""

""We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wasn't too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had any doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut -- because they made it sound like anyone who'd oppose the plan was a child-killer at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise? Hadn't we heard it all our lives -- from our parents and our school-teachers and our ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech? Hadn't we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there's some excuse for what we did at that meeting. Still, we voted for the plan -- and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma'am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil -- plain, naked, smirking evil, isn't it? Well, that's what we saw and helped to make -- and I think we're damned, every one of us, and maybe we'll never be forgiven...

""Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try pouring water into a tank where there's a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it, and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider, and the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand slinging buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six for your neighbor's supper -- for his wife's operation -- for his child's measles -- for his mother's wheel chair -- for his uncle's shirt -- for his nephew's schooling -- for the baby next door -- for the baby to be born -- for anyone anywhere around you -- it's theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures -- and yours to work, from sunup to sundown, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of your life, without rest, without hope, without end... From each according to his ability, to each according to his need...

""We're all one big family, they told us, we're all in this together. But you don't all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a day -- together, and you don't all get a bellyache -- together. What's whose ability and which of whose needs comes first? When it's all one pot, you can't let any man decide what his own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht -- and if his feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it's not right for me to own a car until I've worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage on earth -- why can't he demand a yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed? No? He can't? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he's replastered his living room? ... Oh well... Well, anyway, it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma'am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just one meeting to discover that we had become beggars -- rotten, whining, sniveling beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work didn't belong to him, it belonged to 'the family' -- and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them was his 'need' -- so he had to beg in public for his relief from his needs, like any lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife's head colds, hoping that 'the family' would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, because it's miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm -- so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each claiming that his need was worse than his brother's. How else could it be done? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort got away with the jackpot?

""But that wasn't all. There was something else that we discovered at the same meeting. The factory's production had fallen by forty percent, in that first half-year, so it was decided that somebody hadn't delivered 'according to his ability.' Who? How could you tell it? 'The family' voted on that, too. They voted which men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay -- because you weren't paid by time and you weren't paid by work, only by need.

""Do I have to tell you what happened after that -- and into what sort of creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when we knew that if we did our best for 'the family,' it's not thanks or rewards that we'd get, but punishment? We knew that for every stinker who'd ruin a batch of motors and cost the company money -- either through his sloppiness, because he didn't care, or through plain incompetence -- it's we who'd have to pay with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good.

""There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to 'the family,' didn't ask anything for it, either, couldn't ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn't gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn't come up with any ideas, the second year.

""What was it they'd always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compete for who'd do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn't it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who'd do the worst job possible. There's no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not -- your 'housing and feeding allowance,' it was called -- and above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You couldn't count on buying a new suit of clothes next year -- they might give you a 'clothing allowance' or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn't enough money for new suits for everybody, then you couldn't get yours, either.

""There was one man who'd worked hard all his life, because he'd always wanted to send his son through college. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan -- but 'the family' wouldn't give the father any 'allowance' for the college. They said his son couldn't go to college, until we had enough to send everybody's sons to college -- and that we first had to send everybody's children through high school, and we didn't even have enough for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fight over nothing in particular -- such fights were beginning to happen among us all the time.

""Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records. I guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days, he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music. Well, they didn't give him any 'allowance' for records -- 'personal luxury' they called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody's daughter, a mean, ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth -- this was 'medical need,' because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority complex if her teeth weren't straightened out. The old guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he couldn't forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them.

""Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don't ask how we got the money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there's always ways to get the rotten ones. You don't break into grocery stores after dark and you don't pick your fellow's pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle, but if it's to get stinking drunk and forget -- you do. Fishing tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn't any 'amusement allowance' for anybody. 'Amusement' was the first thing they dropped. Aren't you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it's something that gave you pleasure? Even our 'tobacco allowance' was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month -- and this, they told us, was because the money had to go into the babies' milk fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn't fall, but rose and kept on rising -- because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they didn't have to care, the baby wasn't their burden, it was 'the family's'. In fact, the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a 'baby allowance'. Either that, or a major disease.

""It didn't take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nicke's worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn't marry, he wouldn't help his folks back home, he wouldn't put an extra burden on 'the family'. Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility, he couldn't marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it. They bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all over the country, every unmarried pregnant sister, for an extra 'disability allowance,' they got more sicknesses than any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes -- what the hell, 'the family' was paying for it! They found more ways of getting in 'need' than the rest of us could ever imagine -- they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed.

""God help us, ma'am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we'd been given a law to live by, a moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed it -- for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next man's dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the dishonest collected. The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort of a law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren't many chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country's labor. Within one year under the new plan, there wasn't an honest man left among us. That was the evil. the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else that it could do -- and it was called a moral ideal!

""What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were cheating or plain incompetent, whether they were unwilling or unable -- what difference did that make to us? If we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs -- all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half-stockyards -- a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease -- beasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever's need.

""Love of our brothers? That's when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one man's new shirt, for another's wife's hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house -- it was taken from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to spy on one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as to cut their 'allowance' at the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday -- which he'd paid for by gambling, most likely. We began to meddle into one another's lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get somebody's relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn't want anyone to marry, we didn't want any more dependents to feed.

""In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn't speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now -- well, I'll tell you about just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names and we all liked her -- we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she'd have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for town. They never established the cause of death. No, I don't know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I -- and that's what I can't forget! -- I, too, had caught myself wishing that she would die. This -- may God forgive us! -- was the brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us!

""Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you're not goting to remind me that they'd sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one, too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma'am, depends on what it is you're after. And what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that.

""Eric Starnes, the youngest -- he was a jellyfish that didn't have the guts to be after anything in particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public Relations Department, which didn't do anything, except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn't have to bother sticking around the office. The pay he got -- well, I shouldn't call it 'pay,' none of us was 'paid' -- the alms voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn't riches. Eric didn't care for money -- he wouldn't have known what to do with it. He spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn't stand him.

""Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what the size of his take of -- his alms -- had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out, and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for him -- it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack -- a hundred pounds, we weighed them -- of magazines in Gerald's office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap show-off who's got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough -- except that he makes no bones about the cash being his, and you're free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don't. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesn't care for material wealth, that he's only serving 'the family,' that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it's necessary to keep up the presige of the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public -- then that's when you learn to hate the creature as you've never hated anything human.

""But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists -- just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting -- by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, trying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rules to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody's life except his own -- then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the 'family meetings' -- in the name of 'production efficiency and time economy,' one meeting used to take ten days -- and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Starnes' office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then she made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a ten-minute period on the agenda for discussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a factory's income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people's value. Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father's time, all of his money wouldn't have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you sould have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who'd talked back to her once and who'd just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who's ever preached the slogan: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.'

""This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination -- when five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn't do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choice -- it's because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren't so innocent either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn't do it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we'd be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn't a man voting for it who didn't think that under a setup of this kind he'd muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There wasn't a man rich and smart enough but that he didn't think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better's wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he'd get unearned benefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who'd get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all his inferiors who'd rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss's, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. That was our real motive when we voted -- that was the truth of it -- but we didn't like to think it, so the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good.

""Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we'd asked for, it was too late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in the first week of the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest-skilled workers. A man of self-respect doesn't turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but they couldn't take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a pesthole -- till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability.

""And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century -- and, somehow, we couldn't make ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we couldn't quit, because no other employer would have us -- for which I can't blame him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesville fast -- till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory's needy kept stretching, but the list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don't know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor that didn't have something wrong with it -- the magic stamp began to work the other way around: people wouldn't take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century. And it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but because we needed the orders so badly.

""By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out? What good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane?

""Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to work, when you're tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To work -- and whenever any men failed anywhere, it's you who would have to make up for it. To work -- with no chance to rise, with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle, any famine, any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work -- with no chance for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through college. To work -- on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you'll never see, whose needs you'll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question -- just to work and work and work -- and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This -- a moral ideal?

""Well, we tried it -- and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world -- and that the plan was a noble ideal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy -- the one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year -- got up, as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.""

...

""But what about John Galt?"" she asked. ... ""You were going to tell me who was the John Galt they mean -- if there ever was such a person.""

""I hope there wasn't, ma'am. I mean, I hope that it's just a coincidence, just a sentence that hasn't any meaning.""

""You had something in mind. What?""

"I’m just gonna say it (Russian/Ukrainian conflict) There’s a whole lot about this that makes me feel very uneasy and it’s not just that Putin seems to have gone off the deep end of psycho. 

Suddenly all of legacy media and all multi-million/billion dollar corporations are all jumping on the Ukrainian support wagon. Anonymous is hacking things all over Russia, historically immovably peaceful countries are now participating in sanctions against Russia, the Ukrainian president and several other notable Ukrainians are seen getting involved in the combat. It feels almost an archetypal hero story of the most grand scale imaginable is being directed before our very eyes where the world joins together against the evil supervillain and if there is anything that I have learned about human nature, shits just not that simple. This all feels way too good to be true and that means it almost certainly is.

"What developments in attitude are necessary for a ""stabilized"" anarchy? I believe that anarchistic societies to be the highest ideal to strive for. A plurality of self-sustaining anarchist collectives. However I am burdened by trying to understand why these profit seeking collectives wouldn't join forces to protect their interests and thus lead us back into centralized government.

What changes in attitude or changes to the world at large are necessary to bring about a stabilized anarchy?

Well the good news is that global government mismanagement combined with technological advances is causing a power struggle. If change continues to advance more rapidly than human bureaucracy can cope with, then small groups of people who understand and can utilize those technologies will be freed from the bureaucracy. As technology advances and branches out we may see governments become more or less obsolete. 

However, I'm not certain this will be a good thing for the majority of the slave class. Those who stay on the cutting edge of the new technologies (automation) will be employed by corporations, while those who have no skills to offer these corporations will find they have nowhere to turn to.

When I meander down these thought-paths I always come back to the same conclusion. We humans have multiple problems, but the principle problems are that most communities around the world have outsourced many of their essential needs production (food and water), and we have too many people on this planet.

Because most communities are dependent upon other communities for food and water, changes that affect availability or prices of those commodities must move in lockstep globally or people face starvation or dehydration. We have so many people that disruptions in these markets often cause human suffering.

What exactly is the incentive for managing this complex network of food and water for 7billion people when the corporations running everything only need less than 1billion to create an indefinitely self-sustaining peak civilization?

I'm not saying that it is impossible for the Earth to support 7billion people (though some do make that argument) but that human populations grew faster than our ability to sustainably support our level of population and growth. 

I do see the dissolution of ""modern"" government in the near (10-20years) future, but I'm concerned it will just be replaced with corporate government rather than a plurality of bottom-up societies.",Conservative

"Why you can be a libertarian and anything else at the same. I have had a lot of internal conflicts about different policies lately and at my core I’m libertarian. Meaning I start every issue from a libertarian lense.

I live in a non-libertarian state and I enjoy it more than time I’ve spent in libertarian states. And I realized I’m only a libertarian at the federal level. I support left policies on a state level, but live in a red county and vote for conservative policy with local politics, and non of it is hypocritical or contradictory.

The federal system was set up for exactly this purpose. There’s no reason to scream at what Florida or California are doing. In fact, you should embrace that because if you let states do their thing the federal government will keep their nose out of things.

A more libertarian America means more states doing shot you disagree with.

You have the freedom to move. No excuses. It may cost you and there may be consequences but that’s life. The only thing this sub should be against is authoritarian policy at the federal level.

I think the way Covid was handled was great, people moved if they didn’t like their states policies. People left California. Business owners left Florida. And we should all celebrate that. Some people want to live in California and like the states policies, I do. But I would be appalled to see those same policies at the federal level.

"Big Tech Allows Russian War Propaganda While They De-Platform Pro-American Voices By Brock Simmons

Published February 26, 2022 at 7:30am

&#x200B;

As YouTube works to eliminate pro-American channels (Dan Bongino being the latest casualty), Facebook shadowbans and eliminates conservative pages, and Twitter infamously bans then-sitting-President Trump and this website, Gateway Pundit, both platforms are openly allowing the Russian government to spread its propaganda and disinformation. Apparently, invading a sovereign country isn’t a violation of terms, but questioning the integrity of an election or saying a particular Covid treatment works is strictly forbidden.

&#x200B;

Over on Twitter, u/KremlinRussia_E is the official blue-check-marked account for the President of Russia in English. There is also a duplicate of that account in Russian language, u/KremlinRussia.  They are actively posting tweets. Twitter has no problem with this. Also operating with impunity on Twitter are accounts for Government Of Russia (@GovernmentRF) and the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs (@mfa\_russia).

&#x200B;

You can also count on the Metaverse as a safe haven for Putin and his supporters, as Zuck’s Facebook allows for a Vladimir Putin page, which has over three million followers:

&#x200B;

It’s unclear whether this is his official page or just a fan page, but Zuck doesn’t seem to care.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, YouTube has been allowing Russia Today (RT) to live stream continuously. RT is funded by the Russian government. It features lots of English speakers, namely from the UK. This includes anchors and reporters, some of whom are based in Moscow.

&#x200B;

RT is framing the invasion as a “special operation” and claiming Russia is only trying to liberate Donetsk and Luhansk, which they say Ukraine has unlawfully claimed as their own in violation of the Minsk agreements. They claim Ukraine recently shelled a grade school in Donetsk, killing two teachers and that Ukrainian militia groups have been attacking the region for years. Much of the content is to draw sympathy to the Russian cause and demonize the west and Ukraine.

&#x200B;

But if that were true, why is Russia attacking from all angles instead of just an eastern front, as well as making threats about Finland joining NATO?

&#x200B;

News reports are sprinkled in around repeating puff pieces, one of which chronicles the life of a Spetsnaz soldier. They also claim Russia has no intention of attacking civilian poplulations, despite evidence to the contrary.

&#x200B;

In a bizarre statement, Putin started randomly claiming that Ukraine is run by neo-nazis and white nationalists. Where have we heard this kind of rhetoric before? Oh yeah, from antifa terrorists in the US, trying to justify their street violence against those with whom they disagree.

&#x200B;

The RT roster also includes an American, who reported on air after the UN “security council” meeting. He 100% took Russia’s side with his biased reporting:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While it’s oftentimes important to see what the other side is saying, clearly RT’s role is to convert Westerners into Russian sympathizers, as they constantly paint NATO and Western countries out to be liars and blame the west for the war.

&#x200B;

"Ukraine banned males aged 18-60 from leaving country. I find this unacceptable. Hello,

As many of you I'm watching current conflict on Ukraine with anxiety and emphasizing with countless people that go through the horrors of war due to one magalomaniac with inadequate ambitions.

I was very concerned when I learned about leaving the country ban for 18-60 years old. It caused mixture of extreme emotions that resulted in this short open petition

I am probably naive, but I believe that change is possible if people are communicating with each other with patience and respect. Although I go tomorrow to demonstrate in front of Russian embassy, it is to show solidarity, not to influence Russia's actions. It would be unrealistic to think otherwise.

Yet in my opinion situation is different with decree of president Zelensky. I think that with enough publicity discussion could start and exert right amount of pressure to actually safe lives.

I haven't done my research yet and I'm clueless how Ukrainians are reacting and how many of them share similar thoughts. Yet by a little logic I'm convinced that there are actually people whom this general mobilization will drag to death against their will.

As I said so far I'm clueless how to achieve any significant footprint, so I post here. It is my desire to either join movement that strives for the same or to find help in propagating and polishing above message to stir discussion.

"Potential for WW3 ruin the momentum of the liberty movement? I've been noticing a huge libertarian uprising occuring in the US after the disaster that was the covid lockdowns and the Trump presidency. People are waking up to the lying media, the huge covid lie, and fragile economy that the FED is continuing to make worse and worse. Bitcoin is fundamentally libertarian and is having huge adoption all over the world. As far as I could tell most Americans were dissatisfied with the options for president in 2020. No one wanted Trump but I have yet to meet anyone who is excited about Biden either. With all these things it seems to me this would be the absolute perfect time for a huge third party or libertarian party movement in America. However I'm worried that America becoming involved in the war with Russia would ruin any chance for that. Historically, Americans rally behind one leader, usually a strong man, in times of war. There is no way American citizens would take a chance on a libertarian candidate for president in 2024 if we are mid war. The great momentum the liberty movement has built up over the last couple years has been great but if we do get involved in this war it could destroy that.",Conservative

"How should we combat white supremacy among our elected officials? As many of you have probably already seen, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green and AZ State Senator Wendy Rogers attended AFPAC this week, a white nationalist convention organized by out-and-proud white nationalist and holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Rep. Paul Gosar and Idaho’s Lt. Governor Janice McGeachin also made virtual appearances. 

Many of the speakers who took the stage that day spouted white nationalist rhetoric - the great replacement theory, Jewish “globalist elite” conspiracies, holocaust denial/apologetics, and repeated calls for violence. Wendy Rogers said we need to erect gallows to deal with “traitors”, and one speaker even called for the execution of Dr. Fauci. Oh and Fuentes led everyone in a round of applause for Putin. 

While Greene’s speech wasn’t explicitly white nationalist, just her typical conspiratorial culture war bullshit, she did call the crowd of white nationalists “patriots” and “canceled Americans”. Her presence at the conference signifies an endorsement, or at the very least a tolerance, of the rhetoric the speakers and attendees used. Plus, it lends the conference itself an air of legitimacy to have an elected official in attendance.  

My question is, how should we handle situations like this? We cannot and should not tolerate white supremacy/nationalism among our elected officials, but do we have to wait another five years until she gets voted out? Would Congress be justified in expelling her?",Conservative

"(Satire) Why We Need Mandatory Hand Washing Stations It's already been established that **there is no right to infect people with potentially deadly sicknesses and diseases.** It's a clear violation of the non-aggression principle.

That said, I don't think we're doing enough as a society to protect ourselves from COVID. Even if we get vaccinated and wear masks, we can still spread these diseases such as COVID. **Hand sanitizing stations are NOT enough.** Still, since mask and vaccine mandates work so well, let's take it a step further and call for hand washing stations everywhere. **We've already been having mandates** and rules for a number of years now. All it is, is a necessary step in the fight against COVID.

**After all, it's been scientifically proven that washing hands reduces the spread of sickness and disease such as COVID. Therefore, clean hands are a RIGHT.** It's part of essential healthcare that the government should provide to all of its citizens. It'll be enforced similarly to vaccine passports and mask mandates. Have a hand washing station and wash hands before stepping into a business. If possible, have police and private security standing guard so that every customer, client, and employee complies.

If people have a problem with it, that's too bad. There's no right or entitlement to these businesses' services. **By questioning these rules, you're questioning science.** Stop the spread of misinformation and crazy conspiracy theories. People can still be sick asymptomatically, which means you can be spreading diseases without even knowing it!! Anyone who opposes these measures is a potential FASCIST and should be de-platformed and fired from his/her job. **There is no right to spread misinformation about clean hands.**

How do we fund this, you ask? Let's tax all the rich people and then re-distribute with grants and forgivable loans. Small businesses won't really be losing that much business. It's a no brainer. We'll pump money back into the economy. We'll create plenty of blue collar jobs because of the plumbing and supply movement. If anything, this will benefit the economy because people won't be getting sick!!! It would be good for the news and for our government to track statistics of all Americans who wash their hands at least five time per day.

**If small and medium sized businesses don't provide a right to clean hands, then they should not be in business. Full stop.**

This might suck for now, but it's all for the common good. Let's call for reasonable government intervention to stop the spread of disease until COVID, flu, cold, and all the rest of them are eradicated from this earth.

Thank you all for your time.

"**Use the Magnitsky Act on Justin Trudeau, his cabinet, and the big five banks.** **Use the Magnitsky Act on Justin Trudeau, his cabinet, and the big five banks.**

Over the past week Justin Trudeau and his liberal cabinent have evoked Emergency powers so as to crush the peaceful Freedom Convoy demonstrators and confiscate their bank accounts without any  court orders.

These are demonstrators who after agreeing to Leave their ambassador bridge protest hugged the Police officers who saw them off and had broken up the remainder of the border protests without incident before the emergencies act even took effect, and even after this weekend which saw Officers trample a elderly disabled indigenous woman under horse, and after police had beaten protestors, and seemingly purposefully fired teargas canisters into the legs of attending reporters,  The protestors still joined in chants of “We love you” directed at the cops in an attempt to deescalate and appeal to their better nature. 

An attempt met repeatedly with flash-bangs and rubber bullets.

 .

Many Canadians and Americans have wondered what they can do to resist the seeming death of protest rights in Canada. What can you do when the banks themselves are confiscating perfectly legal donations to peaceful protests and legal defence funds? What can you do when voicing your opinion or merely having made a legal donation can be declared retroactively illegal and you can have your bank account frozen as a result, without even a court order?

The Magnitsky Act was designed to allow the US government more options in dealing with human rights abuses and the silencing of opposition by abusive regimes, by allowing the US government to sanction individual government figures and politically connected individuals directly. Freezing their bank accounts, locking them out of international finance, barring their entry to the US and preventing US firms from doing business with them.

The Magnitsky act was criticized at the time: Why these human rights abuses? Why target Russia? Saudi Arabia keeps 51% percent of its population in a state of apartheid, unable to work, leave the country, or even show their face with out a husband’s permission... why focus on a country which has been considered for admission to NATO, and as recently as the early 2000s the US recognized as democratic?

There are of course plenty of cynical interpretations... but being charitable: the Magnitsky Act is not for the worst human rights abusers. Hardened dictatorships easily weather such sanctions and are well prepared with shell companies, hidden accounts, and other vehicles to evade such limited sanctions. The Magnitsky act was not passed in response to North Korea or the Chinese genocide of the Uighers. It was brought in for the comparatively minor abuse of Russian oligarchs murdering those investigating their corruption (allegedly), not because Russia was some totalitarian country in 2012, but because Russia was still arguably a democracy.

The Magnitsky act is not made for the worst human rights abusers, it is made for democracies that are sliding. The status of Democracy is not an award where you win it , and then like so many Oscar winning actors, you get to coast and make bad comedies for  decades on end. Democracy is a standard of liberty and open debate that a country has to maintain every single day. The US was right to recognize that when someone is commiting criminal acts or abusing political connections to deprive people of their democratic rights, the democracies of the world should call that individual out and use what economic power they have to stop it.

.

Currently both the Government of Alberta and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association are suing Trudeau’s government, arguing that even the lax language of The Emergencies Act does not apply to the Freedom convoy protests. That the act explicitly forbids the declaration of an emergency for peaceful protests, and that the requirements that such an emergency threaten the lives and safety of Canadians, or the sovereignty of Canada was at no time met... the protests being peaceful, the only threat to life coming from police, and The protestors willing breaking up encampments in response to court orders.

Maybe to staid Canadian courts will act but observers can conclude what is obvious: this was an illegal power grab by Trudeau meant to retroactively declare legal donations and legal peaceful protests illegal, and to punish both Canadians,  and Americans with canadian bank-accounts, by seizing their money without a court order, using information illegally hacked from an American company and distributed by state run media at the CBC, so as to punish dissidents for mere political disagreement. shutting them out of the financial system, unable to buy food or pay rent, in the depths of the Canadian winter.

And not a single Executive or Board member from a Canadian big 5 bank has spoken out about this or raised a legal challenge to this illegal violation of their customer’s liberty and property, which they themselves, the banks, are being asked to enforce. The positions of banker is a sacred trusts. Millions have trusted these people with their money on the basis of their presumed character and their strong institutional ethics, a banker should be happily willing to go to jail for years rather than betray his customers to an illegal order, and when he is being asked to do this without even a court order, we’d expect him to be screaming from the rooftops. Canadian bankers instead are gladly accepting the horrifying power Trudeau has given them, and see no problem with betraying decades long customers for the crime of donating to a charity or legal defence fund.

For this reason I believe the US government should Sanction the  executives and board members of the big 5 Canadian banks:  TD (Toronto Dominion), CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce), Scotiabank, RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), and BMO (Bank of Montreal).

Similarly Trudeau and His cabinet should be sanctioned. Just as they have frozen Canadians assets for peaceful protests, the US should use the Magnitsky act to Freeze their assets for their abuses and bar them from US travel just as they had barred truckers from returning to their own country. Sparing of course back bencher Liberal MPs such as Joel Lighbound who have been horrified and vocal in opposition to their own party’s abuses,  even before the emergencies act was declared.

Ironically  deputy prime minister Crystia Freeland, was instrumental in the initial passing of the Magnitsky act, even having pages of hagiographic praise in Bill Browder's book about its passing, and Canada passed its own Magnitsky in 2015 on her influence. We can speculate whether she was a hypocrite then or now, but these are the standards she, and the government of Canada, agreed to be held to. There is no philosophical debate about whether its right or wrong for the US to interfere in Canada’s affairs, These are the same people who vehemently cheered on the US sanctioning Russians in 2012.

Like Tin pot dictators the world over, Trudeau and his cabinet have denounced the “American influence” behind the freedom convoy, denouncing Americans donating to legal defence funds and peaceful protests for Canadians civil liberties. A preferred attack being to accuse the protestors of being Trump supporters, Ie. to accuse them of of being sympathetic to the previous democratically elected president of Canada’s closest ally. With Justice minister David Lametti saying that Trump supporters “should be worried” about having their bank accounts frozen by the Canadian Government.

All this from a government that has nothing but praise for the World Economic Forum or OECD sending millions around the world to fund advocacy institutes in places as far a field as Hungary or Ukraine.

The free spread of ideas and donations for non-partisan, non-election related,  advocacy and support across international borders is the backbone of any free and open society, whether it be Amnesty international or the Jesuits, philosophical and political advocacy of all kinds has been international since the 18th century. Crystia Freeland herself was a Canadian doing journalism and political advocacy for a US media company in Ukraine and spent decades in US politics, Trudeau himself consistently criticized President Trump and used Canadian tax dollars to fund media that was equally critical and presumably had some influence on US politics.

But now that ordinary Americans are expressing equal interest in Canadian politics Trudeau and perhaps the most internationally affiliated cabinet of any country in the world, that have spent collective centuries outside Canada and advocating politics in other countries, they want to retreat into nationalist chauvinism and issolationism... No.

Trudeau wants to freeze bank accounts for donating to a cause he merely accuses of supporting the previous elected  American president, without a court order, he wants to freeze bank accounts quite possibly held by American Citizens or dual nationals, at Banks such as TD or Scotiabank, banks many ordinary Americans use, as his justice minister confirms that “Trump Supporters”  quote “Should be worried”.

Trudeau doesn’t get to pretend this is something where Americans should mind their own business, this concerns Americans greatly.

Biden is has been prominently siding with Trudeau in this, but Americans should be calling on their Republican Governors, Senators,  and congressmen, people like Ron Desantis, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and others who have been deeply critical of Trudeau to Openly demand the use of the Magnitsky Act.

In many respects its already happening to Americans, many of their donations are frozen, a Delaware based company has already been hacked and its donors leaked over this, and all to crush an international protest already planning convoys to Washington.

This isn’t an assault on democracy happening in America’s backyard, this  is an assault happening in America’s doorway.",Conservative

As a libertarian philosophy, its definitely rooted in freedom and the NAP.

"(Pure) Capitalism stands against everything humanity wants to and should be. First of all, no, i don't think communism is better, i just think that our modern system cannot be the full solution. Their either has to be a mix between capitalism and communism or a new better system needs to be created. Either way, back to the post.

Capitalism is based on exploitation of certain parts in the world, it is basically modern slavery, and there is really no counter argument. You can say, that with capitalism comes wealth, yet, really how many people are profiting of it? Well, scientific and technological progress came with capitalism, right? Yet again, how many people in the world really profit from the new, cutting edge technologies? And how many great minds did we loose in exploited parts of the world that would've taken us to another level?

We so often praise the human rights, but really they are incompatible with capitalism. Where is the freedom for people in indian/chinese/bangladesh fabs? Where is their right for individuality and self-expression? To find such examples, we don't even have to look that far, in each and every country, many if not most people have to work just for the sake of getting money to provide for their family. That cannot and mustn't be humanities future. Every human on Earth needs to have a liveable life by default, and not by achieving it through working.

I don't say we should abandon capitalism, who am i to say so, but i really hope that in the near or far future, people much smarter than me will create a near-perfect system, even it is difficult if not impossible.

Sadly, i have a feeling many people will just have me or like-minded people pegged as dumb commi's.

"The Treasury is proposing billionaires paying tax on unrealized capital gains [Here’s how Janet Yellen's proposed tax on unrealised capital gains may work](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.in/international/news/heres-how-janet-yellens-proposed-tax-on-unrealised-capital-gains-may-work/amp_articleshow/87249423.cms)

For those unfamiliar, an unrealized gain is when you hold a financial asset (stock, crypto, options, etc.) that holds a positive value from when you purchased it. When you sell it, it becomes a realized gain, which is already taxed. An unrealized gain can quickly become an unrealized loss because financial assets are variable.

I hope you see how crazy this is. If you happen to be a billionaire then you have to pay a tax, even though you haven't made income and could potentially lose money if the stock declines in value. Furthermore, billionaires generally have most of their wealth in stocks, so it would be a huge tax on them. This would be especially  brutal for founders of companies, who had the stock when it was worth almost nothing. They would have to pay a massive tax on their unrealized gains!

Unlike us regular folks, billionaires don't have to live in the US to work in the US. Why wouldn't they just leave if such a egregious tax were levied? It's also a slippery slope. Once you do it to billionaires, couldn't you eventually push it to millionaires and then less? And if you want change, then why not just raise the capital gains tax on billionaires instead of proposing stupid ideas like this?

As this [source](https://beincrypto.com/treasury-secretary-tax-unrealized-crypto-gains/) puts it:

*Indeed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled the government was looking into taxing unrealized gains earlier this week and sent some crypto investors into a frenzy with one enthusiast insisting it proved the Biden administration was “willing to annihilate all investor sentiment in order to raise money to fund their reckless spending spree.”*",Conservative

"figuring out life in a capitalist world to anyone who replies to this, i appreciate you very much!!!!!! sorry about the length.

dear all, hello. i am at a point in my life (college) where i am figuring out my beliefs and how that aligns with my everyday actions as well as what i study in school and my career choice. i recognize my privilege, i was lucky to be born into a family with significant wealth. i grew up w a new cell phone, vacations multiple times a year, etc. i am accustomed to that lifestyle and dont want to give it up. i have been thinking about what to study and for me right now its between journalism and computer science or economics. very different!  i have been learning a lot about how to budget salaries and realized that the journalist salary would be very low and uncomfortable for me. the idea of making 30k and living in a rural area (to save money) or trying to live on that in an expensive city is not appealing to me. upon talking to others, they said that parents usually help young entry level journalists with bills, rent, etc. i know my parents would be able to help me in this way if i asked but i feel ashamed to ask because 1) i should be able to support myself and 2) that worsens the problem for people who don't have a safety net and i don't want to take opportunities away from them. i could chose to learn about and pursue a career in something i'm less interested in and good at just to not let my parents help me financially (they said that it would not be a burden on them but the ethics concern me bc i feel that its not fair and i would preferably give them money as a thank u for raising me.) if i did it and didnt ask for their help, im concerned that the lack of economic safety net in this country (united states) would leave me struggling and facing tough choices like paying rent or food and i dont want to experience that. regarding career choice, while i feel guilt about wealth and spending their money in the beginning of my career without earning it myself, i dont want to be poor either. i also dont want to chose a profession that would not pay me enough to live comfortably. at the same time, i would like to enjoy what i do at my job and what i study in college. ahhh! what do u think about this?

i have been learning a lot about the experience of being poor in the united states and how tough it can be to live on minimum wage, it seems like minimum wage is below living wage and really sucks. it seems hard to save on that amount and treat urself because everything is going to bills. so ive been reading a lot about it and i realize that minimum wage is not enough to provide a comfortable lifestyle.

also, my parents recently offered to fund a study abroad program in europe this summer but idk whether or not to accept it bc feel so guilty about accepting bc theres so many people that dont have a roof over their head and are struggling. idk what to do, whether i should go or not. should i stop enjoying luxurious things bc so many people are unable to?

also im studying econ rn. is that bad? im like learning about stocks in class and then going home and reading about how they perpetuate inequality. is it morally ok to invest in the stock market? does it take away money from people who are working?

tldr: (pls read the post its alot more detailed) what kind of career should i pursue? how does money factor into that decision? how do you deal with being wealthy in a country where its so rough to be poor? can you use your wealth to go on vacations and go out to eat while also uplifting people who have less privilege and help them go on vacation? can you be rich and enjoy luxurious things and a leg up while also trying to end poverty?

i feel very confused about my next steps. sorry if i sound naive ive just started learning about living wage etc and am trying to form my opinion and figure out how to deal w capitalism and understand it, and what my next moves should be in this system. any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated, im feeling very confused rn.

"Why are wealthy companies subsidized? I'm coming at this from the angle of a liberal capitalist, who believes that a well-regulated capitalist system brings about the most net good for society. I furthermore believe that crony capitalism is a drain on society on multiple levels.

It's no secret that the US federal government (as well as state and local governments) [spends richly on subsidies](https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/subsidy-tracker) for businesses both public and private. Some of these subsidies can even be argued to be a net good, such as subsidizing certain clean energies or technological innovation. However, I can't get over the fact that multi-billion dollar corporations like [Amazon](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/amazoncom), [Boeing](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/boeing), and [Google](https://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/alphabet-inc) receive supplemental income despite being in no danger of going bankrupt.

"There is no such thing as surplus value The core of socialist philosophy is that the worker is generating a 'surplus value,' and that workers are entitled to this surplus because they own their own labor. This is completely wrong and backwards thinking.

When purchasing goods or service on a market, you are paying for their function at the market rate. The seller, who understands the cost to produce the good/service (development cost, time, skill, etc) dictates the price. The price is impacted by other sellers who offer comparable products. The price of a good is influenced by demand.  

Consider a hammer. The seller sets a price for the hammer based on their costs (literal cost, time to produce, experience, etc) and the desirability of hammers in the market. A buyer purchases the hammer based on the market rate and their budget.

If the buyer goes on to build a patio for their family, or a desk that sells for $5000, or a bird-feeder that sells for $10, this does not mean the hammer generated 'surplus value' and the hammer seller is now entitled to additional compensation. It does not mean that the value of the hammer changes depending on the project it is used for. The hammer was simply accomplishing its function for the price it was bought, while the buyer used the hammer along with many other tools and their own skills to produce something greater than the sum of its parts. This aggregation became an entirely new product which has its own price that can be set on the market. The buyer transitions to a seller.

The employee is the same as the hammer in this example. They have a specific price, set by themselves which might be lower, equal to, or greater than the market rate. They sell their skills to buyers (employers) to accomplish a function. The buyer then combines these skills alongside many others to produce something entirely new (the business) whose outputs are purchased at the market rate. 

Nowhere in this cycle was any surplus value being created. Employees are no more entitled to a percent of revenue generated from a business, as a hammer is entitled to revenue generated by the craftsman for their projects.",Conservative

"The man who paid the salaries of Mises, Hayek, & Rothbard has an amazing story of private charity William Volker was an immigrant from the Kingdom of Hanover (Germany) who fled when their country was annexed into the Prussian empire during the 1860s. The family didn't want their children fighting ""wars they didn't care about."" 

Volker became a successful businessman in Kansas City and was extremely generous with his wealth. He even became a voluntary taxpayer when he started the country's first welfare program in Kansas City. He later changed his mind on this idea when the Tom Pendergast political machine co-opted the program for their own purposes. He decided that private charity and free markets were the best way to support the poor. 

Towards the end of his life, he established ""The Volker Fund,"" which would go on to launch free-market scholarship during a time when these ideas were very unpopular in the U.S. He died ""middle class"" since he had already given away his wealth. The fund would go on to pay the salaries of Mises, Rothbard, & Hayek after his death in 1947.

"A story of a former Socialist state Hey Evrybody. I come to you here from Egypt. Egypt as you may have known is a former socialist state. Our story starts with King Farouq, a king of Egypt under the protection of the British in 1950 - ish. Farouq was a very lazy and vulgar king. He was a meh one in that he want cruel or murdurous but he reveled in drinking, parties and women. But his age was kinda a start for a good capitalist economy manifested in ome of the largest Ford factory in the world and I think the only one in Africa and Middle East. Other prominent businesses were booming and multiple ethnicities and nationalities stormed to Egypt to get their fair share of wealth from working different jobs and such. But there was a problem, the life of an Egyptian Peasant was somewhat of a hell. They were uneducated, they worked for nothing for the land owners and they had a miserable life. All this changed when a charismatic group of army officers decided ro surround the king palace with the army and demanded he cedes the kingdom at once which he did giving birth to the Arab Republic of Egypt. 

Arab Repiblic of Egypt was ruled by the leader of the revolution Mohamed Naguib which wanted to establish a good government and abolish the Army council that ruled the Republic and that led to him being overthrown by our hero "" or our villain imo "" mohamed Gamal Abd el Nasser. 

Our Glorious president Nasser was the son of a dirt poor peasant who lived the hard life and saw how the rich were controlling the poor so when the very moment presented itself he turned the ARE into a socialist state with the help of the USSR. He went out to ""redistribute the wealth "" he ""stole "" for lack of a better word every private owned asset in Egypt and turned it into the public sector. That included factories, stores, savings, lands, apartment buildings and anything he could get. He took the personal belongings  of the kings family consisting of jewelery, palaces, cars and lands. He didnt differintiate between Egyptian owned or foreigner owned. He didnt take into account whether you deserved your stuff due to your hard work or due to abuse of peasants. One example is a prominent singer/composer who built his way up from poverty and made the 1st ME and Africa factory to make vinyl records and sound recordings. When Nasser took the country he took the guys company and annointed a trusted officer as the leader with our singer hero as a manager in his own company with a salary of 1 tenth what he made before because it was deemd too much for a human to make. Our singer hero was so heartbroken he died a couple months later.

So now that Nasser had literally everything in the country he started the ""redistribution"". Ofc the officers who helped him with the revolition got the lions share. They were given palaces, jewellery, companies, lands and ""Wives"" of royalty. He then proceeded to give evry peasant a 5 فدان I dont know the english word sorry but it is kinda a lot. Doing that he created a caste of land owners that really did nothinh with it except use it build apartments and houses and then do as little as possible with the rest because as you know farming is now controlled by the state and that meant little to no money as the price is indocated by the state leading to one of the worst disasters to ever befell Egypt. The country who once fed Europe now has lost 70 or 80 percent of its agricultural lands and the rest were nearly barren.

He wrnt to create a public sector of lazy and useless government emplouees who did no work and still got paid because you know thats their ""right"".

He used the factories to employ the same guys who got ""profits"" from the factories even when the factory was a net loss. This invitrd some genious workers to literally burn the factories to grt out of work knowkng that they will get wages and profits even when there is no work is done.

I can go on and on about the police state and the destriction of private businesses. Btw he was also the one who drove the Jews out of their homes because theu wdre ""greedy"" and hoarded money. Putting them in a situation of life or death leading them to rin into Israel who he antagonised in every oppurtunity he got. 

He got Egypt into many wars to help ojr comrades on the middle east and made a propaganda machine so stupid it would make Orwell seem like an optimist. 

He made a social security program that rewarded the lazy and the people who had many children. Near every family in the country had 6 or more children with some of them reaching 20 children. It was even made fun of in a movie of that period. The program gave free housing, free food, free healthcare, free education even universities and a guaranteed job for every memeber in the country. It sounds like a socialist wet dream. 

Oh I can go on and on and on about this guy but I am sure now you got the gist. If you want more I would be happy to do that in another post.

Long story short he got Egypt into goddamn hole and his presidency ended in a disaster. The Egypt- Israel war of 1967 which ended in the near annihilation of Egyptian Armed forces and the taking of Sinai by Israel at which point he wanted to cede the presidency but the people went to the streets chanting his name and he had to accpet to continue leading the country a couple more years till his death.

Long story short, his economic model got worse every passing year for about 70 years till the presidency of our new ""still military sadly bit at least better than his precedents"" president Abdel Fattah el Sisi who took it up onto himself to change the economy giving way to more ""capitalist"" economy by grtting rid of some social programs and investing much more into the infra structure, tourism, private businesses, foreign investments and less into the public sector of lazy unproductive workers. They guy still catered for the extremely poor by removing their slums and relocating them to middle class apartment building and new cities with mich better amenities and oppurtunities. He created a new healthcare system this time with a more controlled environment and workers. He revolutionised education by introducing new systems, e-learning and new exams that rewards the innovative thinking.
Every single report coming from all sources of valid economic studies say that Egypt has done many things right and we r now the 2nd highest economy in Afroca by GDP. Economic magazines and reports indicate we r going the right way and advancing well. We r becoming an energy hub, a property hub and a military equipment hub. 

Many improvements have happened even to the little man so much that even poor villages now have clean water, a good sewer system, hoapitals, schools and goddamn Fiber optics Internet. 

What dies the common man say now ? Well I imagined they would be happy but no. Most people resent him. They say he is fighting religion and God. They say that the good days are gone. That nothing is free anymore. That the youth dont have jobs and apartmnets waiting for them so they cant marry. They say that the new education sucks because it is ""too hard"" they say that the country is making the rich richer and the poor poorer. Multiple left winged movements are calling for revolurions to remove the sictator and restore our glorious socialist state and economy. People have grown so dependant on government that now when they have to stand on their own legs and walk they want to just lay down. I am too tired of this shit.

I know It is a long wall of text and I apologise but I would be happy to hear your thoughts on the matter and to have further discussions if you want.


TLDR. Socialist state for 70 years - Economy shit and near bankruptcy - people grew lazy and dependant - Revolution - new president - more capitalist approach and recovering economy - people whining and threatening violence - leftist want a new revolution to restore the glorious socialist state and economy - too tires of this shit and too tired of people.",Conservative
"Whats your stance on the ongoing conflict? Personally I feel relatively sure.

1. Sanctions have a negative impact. Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea have an embargo and nothing good has come out of that situation, historically sanctions don't have the impact politicians think will have. Only civilians (from sanctioned and sanctioning countries) suffer. In this specific case, the price of oil will radically increase, it could even reach 150$, that will be bad for everyone.
2. NATO is a corrupt imperialist organization, NATO has lied in the past and will continue to do it to. The lied in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and Yemen. They have massively financed the military industrial complex. The US energy sector also has interests in war, with Russia out of the way the US will be (by far) the most important supplier of energy to Europe.
3. Putin is a fascist and an authoritarian, his actions are NOT justified.
4. The ongoing centralized military is a horrible way to prevent foreign attacks, historically Ukrainian citizens have had their right to bear arms extremely limited by government licenses and prohibitions, it has always been illegal to own military caliber weapons, the citizens are defenseless against invasion. Organized and decentralized guerrillas are a much better way to defend against foreign invasions like Vietnam did against the US.
5. Ukraine has dangerous Neo nazi groups which are relatively small, but if NATO continues to finance them and they win the conflict, it could have similar consequences as in Afghanistan with the Mujahideen.

"What's stopping private legal systems from judging in their customers favour all the time? If they profit from prison labour... Hi, I'm a minarchist, who is for a volentaryist quasi-state. Former an-cap and I've some questions relating to my misgivings on privatised legal systems. So where am I wrong, in your opinion? Also I'm slightly dyslexic, apologies.

The system of the plaintiffs choice could entail any punishment, for the most minor of infractions... Would companies that made use of prison labour, not profit most from life sentences, for the most minor of crimes? Could they not pay the courts for prisoners or even run the courts themselves? Would this not create a massive incentive for false imprisonment and lengthy sentences for the most minor of infractions? Also false accusations to such systems to win compensation.

What are the prisoners rights? If the private legal system determines it, it could be anything, even nothing. It's deliberately crazy but imagine if prisoners were sold as a sex slaves? Why does the accuser have to use a system? Cant he tie the accused up in his basement, who's stopping him? If people are... What extra right is it that private legal systems have to judge and detain people that he doesn't?

I mean I do like aspects of Robert Murphy's suggestions on prisons in a free society, I think there may be a place for things like he suggests. But really struggle with the idea of unlimited choice in law. Defence is justified but beyond that when the assailant is detained it's not longer defence.  To me it aught be the pursuit of justice, but with choice it's whatever the accuser and court wants to get out of it, namely a guilty verdict and profit... Aside from that revenge, financial gain, sadistic pleasure anything.

We have law and order and due process, innocent until proven guilty, not to protect the guilty but to *try* to protect the innocent. When choice enters the equation what prevents the accuser from subjecting the accused, to a system who's trail they are incapable of winning...

- if government / a non-capitalist entity owned a 'critical' site, I'd assume they would 'proactively' address potential disasters, maybe skirting them. 
- if a capitalist entity owned a critical site, does history not prove that any address of disaster needs to have clear & compelling evidence of fault, widespread public perception of fault, etc. Meaning many more lives could be lost.

Here and there and everywhere that a little capital courts investment, there is ever one of these little Jews ready to make a little suggestion or place a little bit of a loan.

The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.” Karl Marx, “On the Jewish Question,” 1844



“This splendid territory [the Balkans] has the misfortune to be inhabited by a conglomerate of different races and nationalities, of which it is hard to say which is the least fit for progress and civilization. Slavonians, Greeks, Wallachians, Arnauts, twelve millions of men, are all held in submission by one million of Turks, and up to a recent period, it appeared doubtful whether, of all these different races, the Turks were not the most competent to hold the supremacy which, in such a mixed population, could not but accrue to one of these nationalities.” Karl Marx, “The Russian Menace to Europe,” 1853




“Thus we find every tyrant backed by a Jew, as is every Pope by a Jesuit. In truth, the cravings of oppressors would be hopeless, and the practicability of war out of the question, if there were not an army of Jesuits to smother thought and a handful of Jews to ransack pockets. ... The fact that 1,855 years ago Christ drove the Jewish money-changers out of the temple, and that the money-changers of our age, enlisted on the side of tyranny, happen again to be Jews is perhaps no more than a historic coincidence.” Karl Marx, “The Russian
 Loan,” 1856

“The expulsion of a Leper people from Egypt, at the head of whom was an Egyptian priest named Moses. Lazarus, the leper, is also the basic type of the Jew.” Karl Marx, letter to Friedrich Engels, May 10, 1861



“Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were fantasy-mongers, that the Israelites were idolators ... that the tribe of Simeon (exiled under Saul) had moved to Mecca where they built a heathenish temple and worshipped stones.” Karl Marx, letter to Engels, June 16, 1864



“Indian society has no history at all, at least no known history. What we shall call its history is but the history of the successive invaders who founded their empires on the passive basis of that unresisting and unchanging society.” Karl Marx, New York Daily Tribune, August 8, 1853




“Russia is a name usurped by the Muscovites. They are not Slavs, do not belong at all to the Indo-German race, but are des intrus [intruders], who must again he hurled back beyond the Dnieper, etc.” Karl Marx, letter to Friedrich Engels, June 24, 1865",Conservative

"Blowing the communist's ""nazis and fascist were leftists"" argument into smithereens It's known to most that the above mentioned have stemmed from a common ideological origin,namely socialism. it's also equally known that socialism is a General term for collectivism that embodies an array of variants ranging from class(communism) to race(nazism) and nationality(fascism)

But,leftist propaganda,as it's notoriously know for,managed to circumvent definitions to their utmost advantage in attempt to arm their mindless drones with hate and contempt for Capitalism.We see this even today in the light of the recurring domestic terrorism perpetrated by a bunch of losers such as BLM(Boy Loves Man) and Antifag movement. groups tjat carried the same ideology their predecessors revered and espoused predicated on coercion and deception. They call themselves Antifascists but anyone who cracks open history books will learn for certain that ""fascist is derived from the word ""fascio"" or a bundle(collective) and we also know that The founders of fascism such as Menito Busolini and Giovanni Jentile were devout and rabid marxists. we know that fascism is a nationalist departure from the italian internationalist socialist theme that led the party excommunicating Benito Musolini for suggesting  that nationalism with socialist flavor sells better to people than the sorvet onion's international flavor. but the postmodern counterparts of socialism these days will deny this using impassioned words because they are burdened by denial against the fact that Fascism is indeed socialism with nationalist theme.

Nazism falls not far from it's tree(fascism) only, The nazis newly found addiction pushed them further towards a much ambitious goal,and that is to carry out socialism only now,with the might of nationalism and race combined. and this is apparent upon the drafting of the Nazi's electoral manifesto(25-point plan) back in the 20's



The program of the NSDAP


The program is the political foundation of the NSDAP and accordingly the primary political law of the State. It has been made brief and clear intentionally.
All legal precepts must be applied in the spirit of the party program.
Since the taking over of control, the Fuehrer has succeeded in the realization of essential portions of the Party program from the fundamentals to the detail.
The Party Program of the NSDAP was proclaimed on the 24 February 1920 by Adolf Hitler at the first large Party gathering in Munich and since that day has remained unaltered. Within the national socialist philosophy is summarized in 25 points:
1. We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of peoples.
2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in respect to the other nations; abrogation of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.
3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people, and colonization for our surplus population.
4. Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently no Jew can be a member of the race.
5. Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest, and must be
under the authority of legislation for foreigners.
6. The right to determine matters concerning administration and law belongs only to the citizen.
Therefore we demand that every public office, of any sort whatsoever, whether in the Reich, the county or municipality, be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting parliamentary economy, office- holding only according to party inclinations without consideration of character or abilities.
7. We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to sustain the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich.
8. Any further immigration of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since the 2 August 1914, be forced immediately to leave the Reich.
9. All citizens must have equal rights and obligations.
10. The first obligation of every citizen must be to work both spiritually and physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all
Consequently we demand:
11. Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of rent-slavery.
12. In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore we demand the total confiscation of all war profits.
13. We demand the nationalization of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).
14. We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries.
15. We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.
16. We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate
communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.
17. We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land.
18. We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, Schieber1 and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.
19. We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order.
20. The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the State must be striven for by the school [Staatsbuergerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the State of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.
21. The State is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.
22. We demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army.
23. We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that a: All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race b: Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language c: Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications or any influence on them and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications which are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.
24. We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: common utility precedes individual utility.
1 “Trafficker”
 
25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.

"The popular ""temporarily embarrassed millionaires"" quote by John Steinbeck is about privileged communists, not poor people thinking they will become rich It amazes me how many people misinterpret the origins of this quote. 

>As quoted in A Short History of Progress (2004) by Ronald Wright: ""John Steinbeck once said that socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" This has since been cited as a direct quote by some, but the remark is very likely a paraphrase from Steinbeck's article ""A Primer on the '30s."" Esquire (June 1960), p. 85-93:  
>  
>**""Except for the field organizers of strikes, who were pretty tough monkeys and devoted, most of the so-called Communists I met were middle-class, middle-aged people playing a game of dreams. I remember a woman in easy circumstances saying to another even more affluent: 'After the revolution even we will have more, won't we, dear?'** Then there was another lover of proletarians who used to raise hell with Sunday picknickers on her property...""  
>  
>**""...I guess the trouble was that we didn't have any self-admitted proletarians. Everyone was a temporarily embarrassed capitalist. Maybe the Communists so closely questioned by the investigation committees were a danger to America, but the ones I knew — at least they claimed to be Communists — couldn't have disrupted a Sunday-school picnic.** Besides they were too busy fighting among themselves.""

"Liberals Need to Stop Lying About Conservative ""Support"" of Putin. I'm a conservative. I'm conservative enough to have been asked to be a mod here... an honor and a responsibility I accepted.  I understand that when President Trump commented on Vladimir Putin's intellectual gifts and strategic prowess - before the shooting started - that he was issuing a simple statement of fact.  No approval.  Not admiration.  Merely observation.

President Trump is a strategist.  Putin is a tactician.  Biden is neither.  When President Trump commented on Putin's pre-war maneuverings on the Russia / Ukraine border he was noting what every competent strategist noticed:  he was playing his hand well (which was a little surprising because Putin isn't a great strategist, as evidenced by him calling his own bluff and invading Ukraine). 

Let me give an example: I have a cousin who is, basically, my evil twin.  Like me, he is very capable in a lot of areas.  I do not admire him.  Let me say that again:

*I do not admire him.*  In fact, I hold him in contempt because I understand his talents, and I've seen him use those talents to do evil.

THAT is what President Trump said about Putin, yet the liberal media, the misinformation / disinformation bots on Reddit, and the useful idiots in Congress like Mitt Romney and AOC have - once again - taken something President Trump said completely out of context.  Then they try to paint US with the same brush, as if conservatives admire Putin and support the invasion.

Let me throw this out there, because I work with a lot of military guys and former military guys.  (Liberals are wildly under-represented in the military, so it's not like those latte-sipping panty-waists would even know which end of the rifle is the loud end, anyway.)  There isn't one of us who wouldn't be on the next C-17 to Kyiv if they called us out of the retired reserves to fight the Russians.

The fact is that Russian troops are in Ukraine because Joe Biden is weak.  When the US is strong - and is seen to have strong leadership - guys like Putin and Xi take a knee and bide their time.  Sometimes they try to tip elections in their favor like they did in 2016 when they collaborated with the Clinton campaign, and sometimes they succeed like they did in 2020.  This time they got what they wanted:  a weak, incompetent, and corrupt sock-puppet in the Oval Office.

"Why anarcho-capitalism *almost* works, but doesn't. There are two things that prevent anarcho-capitalism from being viable: Standards of goods and services, and intellectual investment.

Allow me to explain: in any economy, capitalist, redistributed, or otherwise, there are incentives to create value profitably for goods and services. This necessarily means that producers of these will seek the most optimum margins for profit of these goods and services: this is exactly the right thing to do, but it leads, seemingly inevitably, to the incentive of expedience as a way to facilitate this, which is a very good thing until that expedience causes those goods and services to become dangerous.

Take a light switch, for example.  There are standards and regulations that describe how much current they should be capable of withstanding, the materials they should be constructed of, the way they should be installed, the physical aesthetics they should adhere to, and so on.  Without these standards, light switches- or any commodity item- will be subject to competition switches built to unspecified standards, using materials that may or may not put the function of the switch or the safety of the users at risk, chosen to produce that switch at lower cost, with lower cost to the consumer.

This, in itself, is a problem, but not a big one.  The big problem with this is the consequences: cheap parts, subject to dangerous usage, will inevitably lead to damage, or if you want to keep track of this, the loss of items or functionality of financial value (including human life, which has value that can be measured using money to assess that value).  

And so the situation occurs when losses are caused by people making decisions that were expediently beneficial, and now the problem should become clear: how is that lost value repaid, and how is a person without enough value to be held to account when they can't repay the damages they have caused?  If life were simple, it would be their own loss: use a shitty switch, your own house burns down, and you die in a fire.  But life has put most of the world close together- in apartments, joined homes, or in buildings very near each other, and damage is inevitable.  Who must be held to account for it, how, and who is actually to blame?

If I install my own light switch in my apartment that causes a fire that kills everybody and destroys the building, is it my fault for buying a switch that was unsafe, whether I knew it or not? is it the land lord's, for not installing a safer switch? is it the fault of the manufacturer for not producing a safer switch? is it the fault of the other residents, for living with a neighbor as dumb as me? What if I had no choice- if I'm poor and can only afford the cheapest switch, am I more to blame for not capitalizing on opportunities as well as others? if there is only one switch available, is it the retailer's fault for not stocking others? is it the fault of manufacturers who could have produced safer switches to compete with this one, but didn't? Is it everybody's fault- but if so, what portion of blame does anybody share? Even if everything is insured, is the loss less tangible because it has been transferred to an agency that seeks to capitalize on presumed risk of loss, and which has incentives to not recognize and cover the loss- perhaps by blaming me for installing a switch which was not covered under the insurance plan?


The second problem is intellectual investment.  In a broad sense, this covers both research and development and intellectual property.  I won't stand up and defend the patent system as it is here, because it has many problems, but it is a means of captalizing that, since it is regulated, is also a means of exchange (briefly: if I design a helicopter and patent it, but have no capability or interest in producing it, patents let me captitalize on this anyway by selling the rights to the idea, even though I'm just a person, and the buyer would likely be a large company or syndicate that I would be unable to compete with on equal terms otherwise).

So: creativity, research, design, invention, iteration on designs or solutions, and discovery all have monetary value, all are the result of investment by the people accomplishing these tasks, and the inability of these people to compete with established players in a market can be considered an opportunity cost that is exactly equal to the value their work alone increases in the market that they do not benefit from financially, despite any attempts to do so.

There are at least two possible situations directly following, and a further lost opportunity from the (also seemingly inevitable) result of keeping the fruits of this labor secret.

First, there is the case where the secret is eventually successfully implemented by a competitor, which relies on investment by the competitor in independent research and attempts, as well as other costs such as reverse engineering, and is further complicated because the time this takes may or may not give the secret's original discoverer time to capitalize on it and be able to compete in an existing marketplace: an example is the telescoped locking head lug mechanism in bolt action rifles, which a german inventor developed and was able to capitalize on, but which was eventually implemented elsewhere independently; there are plenty of other examples here, and all induce risk that can be mitigated with some form of regulation, even de-facto consensus.

The second case is that the secret can never be replicated, and dies with the creator or discoverer; in this case, the entire human species experiences a tangible financial loss in the form of decreased operating capacity.

Finally,the lost opportunity is for iterations on development as a result of secrecy: imagine if petrol engines were a secret, kept in locked boxes, only opened by their inventor; we would not have diesel engines, or rotary engines, or any of the other things inspired by the design- or as a best case scenario, we would have the opportunity cost of the time it took for those other things to be independently derived.

So, these are the apparent achilles heel in anarcho-capitalism; it results in unnecessary debt or opportunity cost as a direct result of attempts to capitalize.  This doesn't mean that the entire idea must be scrapped: it means that these issues must be addressed meaningfully, honestly acknowledged, and solutions found for them.",Conservative

"Do people have a natural right to land? I just want to get this sub's take on the matter.

Negative rights seem to be one of the hallmarks of libertarianism. So, in that case, is land use a natural right? Someone has to actively restrict me from using most of the land in the USA, to actively restrict me from cutting down trees or building something on said land, living off of it.

And, on a very practical level, I am very curious; humans are animals, after all, and we don't deprive *other* animals the right to use land.

Perhaps unlike air, land is exhaustible, so it naturally gets some market value. But, what if everyone was given a plot of somewhere on an order of magnitude of an acre? With 2.4 billion acres in the USA, the 330 million population, that would only add up to about 13% of the land in the USA. 

I'm not advocating here, I'm actually just curious and am trying to work this problem out myself. I would really like it if more people had access to land, personally. I find myself able to use a family farm to hobby farm, and it's a great experience, so I'm just thinking about how we could improve access to such an opportunity for people in general, get people out of the ""grind away in a cube till you die"" shit and back to a more natural way of living.",Conservative

"The Goal of Capitalism is to reduce the value of capitalism... ok now hear me out before you jump on your soap box.

Capitalism has many facets but one of them is to drive down price through competition - which is the part I'm talking about today.  Eventually, as long as there is a system that is in place to prevent and punish planed obsolescence, all prices go down to % fractions above cost.  This is because, in a healthy and fair market (which we don't have but that is a different story), productivity and efficiency increases over time.  Well long term, including automation of all things, we are literally talking about a 0 sum game by the end where capitalism wins by evolving itself into something else - what that is I have some hypothesis on (a new revolution in the public domain as well as traditional buying methods both together and combined).  What happens when we hit that point where we have invented the most affordable ways to live, cleared out all margins and middle men and the economic force drives towards 0 because of the unlimited supply (think how digital products have infinite supply but only in a physical reality through automation, 3d printing and so on).  If that isn't the goal, what is ultimately the goal?  Capitalism has great qualities, it's not perfect by far, but there is a point where it may become incompatible with how humans live long term (50-100 years from now).  If you were to select a long term goal for Capitalism, knowing how it works, what does that look like to you today?

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Rama Rau, published by DW in 2022 - English narration.



Information
------------------------------
A midwife is fighting against sexism in India. As India's so-called ""village of men"" demonstrates, a society without women has no future.

In India, a girl is aborted every 12 seconds. Every 22 minutes a woman is raped. The connection between these two statistics is as startling as it is terrifying.

Illegal ultrasounds to detect and abort female foetuses have become increasingly popular over the past two decades. So-called ""sterile villages"", where not a single girl has been born in decades, are scattered throughout India. As a result, the world's largest democracy is on the verge of collapse.

There may be as many as 32 million single Indian men by 2025. Increased levels of violence towards women looms on the horizon. Filmmaker Rama Rau's film paints an intimate portrait of these untenable conditions.

The film tells the story Neelam Bala, a midwife who unwaveringly encourages women to also give birth to girls - in defiance of their husbands, mothers-in-laws, and tradition.",Conservative

"I used to be an anarcho-capitalist... just a quick take on things.... no hate... i feel like *most* of the disagreements between anarcho-capitalist and rest of the anarchist community is just semantic.. for example, if you don't have a state, you do not have *capital* in the sense of monopolized currency. 

i came out of this viewpoint however for a couple reasons, including but not limited to:

- 1. violence (and the non-initiation of force) is not the be all and end all.. there are multiple forms of violence, including systematic forms of violence - many types of which I might be ignorant of.
- 2. reducing everything to a capitalist measurement might be great for a ""worst case scenario"" understanding, which makes the ancap perspective stronger.. but... it also has a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy thing about it.

my viewpoint got a little bit expanded from reading some rousseau and foucault... and understanding ""neoliberalism"" and sophisticated means of control.. just like how freedom is not choosing democrat or republican, freedom is not choosing your kellogs or... uh, another brand. ",Conservative

A person rapes another (even though more people would be armed, some would still find a way to incapacitate a victim). The wrongdoer gets away and the victim sues the wrongdoer. The dispute organization invites the wrongdoer to attend the trial/session, but the wrongdoer refuses even to communicate. The wrongdoer also has no security company, or otherwise, to automatically engage in talks.

This is where I start to run out of ideas. Would the dispute organization be able to issue a warrant to collect more evidence? If not, I imagine the dispute organization would analyze the evidence without the wrongdoer's defense and conclude that a certain restitution/punishment would be appropriate.

"Profit, consumer product quality, and other criteria for product lifespan decisions Wikipedia wrote:

>In economics, many problems involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods is determined by the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization

> planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life or a purposely frail design, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain pre-determined period of time upon which it decrementally functions or suddenly ceases to function, or might be perceived as unfashionable. The rationale behind this strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as ""shortening the replacement cycle""). It is the deliberate shortening of a lifespan of a product to force people to purchase functional replacements.

>Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an oligopoly. Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the customer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them (see brand loyalty). In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an information asymmetry between the producer, who knows how long the product was designed to last, and the customer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence


Note that even if a product manufacturer wants the product to last a reasonably long time, it is impossible for a product to last forever, and any product design optimized too heavily toward lifespan is likely to sacrifice more important factors. Even a very skilled engineer cannot guarantee high value for the consumer by simply sacrificing profit or maximizing any set of desirable factors. Further, some important economic ideas, such as ""externalities"" and ""goodwill,"" cannot be factored into most engineering calculations.


Many introductory books on capitalism suggest the profit is the only objective that must be optimized in any capitalist system. However, in any system with product design, the profit derived from a product is only one technical consideration. Some superficial proponents of capitalism sometimes argue that capitalism is the only system that works, and any system that is not profitable must be discarded immediately. However, in practice, capitalist factory owners are often willing to sink money into very costly product development campaigns that lose money for years.


Even though profits can be optimized in the short run, this can lead to ""wreck it and run"" management, in which a new manager takes over a company, throws it into chaos to jack up the stock price temporarily, takes profits by selling stock, and then retires with a golden parachute while the company crashes and burns.


Here is my modest proposal for people who advocate capitalism: be cautious of saying, ""Profit is the most important thing,"" or ""The rights of the shareholders are the only important rights.""",Conservative

"What is right-wing populism  Please correct my definitions of the left/right divide in politics if you disagree. How I define ""right-wing"" is the veneration of hierarchy as a way of organizing society. As in a pyramid-shaped distribution of power and authority in any given organization. There are a smaller and smaller group of people with ever greater authority to control the ones beneath them.  


Conversely, ""left-wing"" is the veneration of egalitarianism as a way of spreading out authority  to as many people as reasonably possible.  


I think these definitions help explain why some ideologies fall in either camp. A classic example is Marxism vs capitalism (I understand capitalism isn't an ideology but it is often discussed as one).  


As a capitalist, especially if you believe in a form of meritocracy, the people who own or generate capital and money earn their positions of power and influence. It is both a good and an effective way of maintaining society to let people who deserve/earn the power be the stewards of society.  


Conversely, the socialist/Marxist wants to limit the power of capital holders so that the workers, the majority people have the most say in how society is run. I understand this may be a gross oversimplification.  


I only belabor this to explain my viewpoint and why I'm so confused by the prominence of right-wing populism.  


I ask this complete sincerity, Is it possible to have a sense of class consciousness and not be ""left-wing""? Am I confusing class consciousness with populism?   


This is where I show my bias but in the context in American politics, I have often felt that self-described right-wing populists have to settle with culture battles that their ""populace"" want because the right-wing portion of their belief prevents them from critiquing the actual people with power ie the 1 percent (or more accurately 0.5%) Even when they do go after a Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg or George Soros, it's less about their disproportionate wealth and influence and more about the specific agenda. Mind you, this isn't inherently bad and they're well within their rights to do so obviously, However, pardon my bias, it often comes across as surface level. A great example, do people (particularly conservatives) hate/criticize Twitter for essentially having the privileges of a private company while having the power and influence of a utility, or do they get mad at perceived bias against right-leaning Twitter users? I often find that its the latter and personally I think the former would be much more productive.

"Welfare economics is pseudo-scientific nonsense Welfare economists must be fired. there's trillion of funds to ameliorate the poor yet poverty still persists.because poverty is a constant like gravity. we cant get rid of it as much as we cant make perpetual motion machines possible

Suppose the government robbed $100 from someone(perhaps an upper midclass)and needs to redistribute it to Sernie Banders(A) and Wichard Rolff(B) ,A claims that the money is more important to him, while B is fine. assume A's $100 equals twice the utility(200), while B's 100 utility. Then, the problem is to redistribute the $100, with this utility disparity in mind. Nash (1950) has a suggestion.

Welfare economists elucidates the problem with a 2D graph where the x axis measures A's utility, u1, while the Y axis B's, u2. The distribution problem is to find some point on the line joining A's and B's utility. In this particular example, this line can be mathematically expressed as

u1+2u2 =200

Welfare economist's suggestion is to make the two utilities  equal, i.e.,


u1 =u2 .


If you graph this. it will show a 45degree(diagonal line) from the origin on the image provided and the intersection of the two lines shows result.
For the present example, the solutions for the two u's are: u1 =u2 =67.7

https://ibb.co/zQ5YRN5


Converted to money, Sernie Banders(A) obtains $33.3, while Wichard Rolff(B) $67.7. This is just the opposite of what they have asked. Citizen A will be disappointed, while B pleasantly surprised.


When the government allots subsidy for farming, governments gets the lion share, as they are the biggest landlord. In Taiwan, the number of farmers triples, after the government has doubled the Old Farmer Subsidy. The VAT scheme practiced in many countries has a regressive nature of cutting a larger percentage of the poor's income. Warren Buffet complains that he pays too little tax, while most bailout money goes to fat cats. What a wonderful world!



As if Welfare economist's scheme is not truly welfare, some socialists proposes a more direct re- distributing scheme, by snatching money from Sernie Banders(A) and giving it to Wichard Rolff(B) or vice versa. socialists claims that the result is at least socially indifferent.proves that such shuffling is like Cutting off your arm to avoid getting handcuffed.



Income re-distribution is a welfare policy, but using utility for that purpose creates more uneven distribution. There is a Chinese saying: help the urgent, not the poor. Perhaps, that is what welfare policy should be. Perhaps, economists should give up welfare research and should concentrate on capitalism's inherent ability to lift the destitute off poverty.

"Need moral advice from AnCap perspective re: a friend's land deal A friend and i had a falling out over how he handled a land deal that turned sour and I want to know if you all think I did the right thing.

Both of us have been AnCaps since high school though I haven't always been into the philosophy of it as much as he is. He left town after high school and basically got rich in Silicon Valley doing db administration.

The trouble started last year when my friend bought some land in town he wanted to build a summer home on. The previous owner had a house on it that burned down and he stopped paying taxes on it (or something like that. I don't know the details) so it got repossessed by the city. My friend bought it from the city and started drawing up plans to build on it. I was going to help oversee the project while he was away (since I live right down the block and used to do construction work).

A couple months after he bought it we were surveying the property and we found a squatter. He had built a little lean to and had planted some potatoes and corn. We told him he had to leave but the squatter wouldn't budge. Things got pretty heated and my friend basically threatened to call the cops if the guy didn't leave by the time they started work tearing down the old foundation.

Threatening government force doesn't sit right with me although I guess if we're forced to pay for it we might as well use it when we're in the right. But anyways, I decided to try to reason with the squatter a couple days later. I explained the situation to him and why my friend had a right to the land but the squatter wasn't having it. The squatter says the government had no right to take the land from the previous owner and that my friend basically paid for stolen goods so he doesn't have a rightful claim. The squatter says he's got a better claim than anyone since he homesteaded it after it was abandoned by the previous owner. He wants my friend to buy the property off him.

My friend was upset that I even suggested buying off the squatter. He says the squatter knew he was breaking the law when he started squatting so he deserves what's coming to him and that since he owns the land the squatter is violating the non aggression principle. I'm not so sure about that because I don't see why it's my friend's property at all. Really, you could say we're violating the squatters rights by threatening to send jack booted thugs against him. 

Long story short, I told my friend I wouldn't help oversee the project unless he bought the land off the squatter fair and square. Now he's not talking to me and I assume he's going to send jackbooted government thugs over there soon. Did I do the right thing?",Conservative

"I believe that the state is necessary, but not sufficient, for a peaceful society. (crosspost /r/changemyview) I posted the following on [/r/changemyview] (https://pay.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1zxsb8/i_believe_that_the_state_is_necessary_but_not/). I would love to hear the anarchist counter-argument.

My views here are heavily based on *Better Angels of Our Nature*, by Steven Pinker, and the ideas of Thomas Hobbes, as presented by Pinker. I have not read Hobbes directly.

**The Hobbesian Trap**

There are four main motives for violence:

1. Predation - You have something I want. I attack you so I can forcibly take it.

2. Preemptive Strike - ""Do unto others before they do unto you."" If I think there is a chance you will attack me for any reason, then I may gain an advantage if I seize the initiative and attack you first. This can apply even if the reason I think you will attack me is because I think that you think that I will attack you. This, as I understand it, is the Hobbesian Trap.

3. Revenge/Retribution - ""Self help justice"" I think you have done something against me, whether it be a physical attack, or an insult. I attack you in retaliation. This is tied to deterrence (4). If I maintain a reputation for retaliation, then you may be hesitant to attack me. Revenge is exacerbated by the fact that everyone thinks they are more ""in the right"" and their enemies are more ""in the wrong"" than they actually are, leading to escalation.

4. Deterrence - ""The best defense is a good offense."" I attack you to establish my reputation and strength. This can be retaliation (3), or pre-emptive strike (2).

**Leviathan**

The solution to the Hobbesian Trap is ""Leviathan"", also known as the state. It can break the Hobbesian Trap in a few ways:

1. Deterrence - By punishing those who act against the best interests of society it makes crime less attractive. It also takes the burden of deterrence off of individuals, which means that their reputation for strength is less important.

2. Breaking the cycle of revenge - By carefully reviewing the details of a case (the judicial process), Leviathan can get an impartial idea of what happened, so that it can give a proportional sentence. Because retribution is coming from a third party, instead of from the individuals in the dispute, there is less incentive to counter-retribution.

3. De-escalation - If I know that you don't have very much incentive to attack me, them I don't have as much incentive toward peremptive strikes, or toward building up my offensive strength.


**Statistics**

According to Steven Pinker, the statistics back up the Hobbesian view of the state and violence. On average, state societies have less war deaths (per capita and as a percentage of all deaths) and a lower homicide rate than stateless societies. (See *Better Angels of Our Nature*, ch. 2 ""The Pacification Process"", esp. fig 2-2, pg. 49; fig 2-3, pg. 53; and 2-4, pg 55.)

**Caveats**

I am aware that states can and have wrought extreme violence, both on their own citizens and on foreigners. Harassment, brutality, false imprisonment, executions, torture, war and genocide have all come out of states.

Police abuse their power. The judiciary convicts innocent people, not always unintentionally. Laws punish people who are aren't hurting anyone.

But, I believe that, even with those things taken into account, society is, on balance, more peaceful with a state than without.

"Labor Theory of Value is Groundless Garbage. It has no practical utility/applications much less have the quality to predict anything. it presumes that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between labor and value but we know that is utter drivel. demand and supplies have infinite elasticities and we know that through this basic production function  Q = f(K, L, P, H) that Labor(L) is only a small conglomerate of production and much more part of cost which is linear ,and not of productivity which is mostly denominated by capital investments such as land,machines and human capital(specialisation)



Marx invokes LTV to explain price, i:e Diamonds constitutes higher prices, for more labor is exhausted during the production, or colder regions have comparative advantage in crop growth therefore fewer workers are needed for production. Does higher labor cost necessarily mean higher output price?  the opposite is true, that a more valuable labor corresponds to a lower output price. It also shows that marx theory which he parodied from ricardo and smith is groundless vermin of garbage.and that its practice is Marxian nonsense and its result is catastrophic.

assuming  an employer hires labor, L, to produce output, Q, by a production function of Q = ALα , where A is  constant. assuming further that this employer observes a profit
function:
π=pQ-wL
where p=product price, while w =wage rate.
Profit maximisation will derive the following output supply and input demand
function

Q=(αAp/w)^ α/1-α

L= (αAp/w)^ α/1-α


α = wL/pQ

Now, we can disprove Marx labor theory of value (see graph provided)where the y-axis measures price while its x axis one quantity, manifests two supply curves corresponding to α=0.6 and α=0.7 according to the earlier equation i provided  (Q=(αAp/w)^ α/1-α) obviously for the same quantity, the price associated with α=0.7 is lower (or for the same price, the quantity much larger). Hence, the more valuable is the input, the lower the output price.1
This result may look baffling to some pidgeon-brained economists, but there is a good rationale behind it. Marx considers all workers similar, but in reality though,some laborers are much smarter than others. A smarter laborer may ask for a higher compensation, but the resulting output price is surprisingly lower. If instead of a lower price, the alternative result is larger quantity, as also shown in graph i provided,the profit for the firm that hires these workers will be massive. If it is just an individual, a superstar, who makes this change to achieve this increased profit, the firm will pay him/her an astounding wage rate. That is what’s happening in the real life.
To be fair to Marx, an increase of the same kind of workers do raise cost and price, as a movement along a supply curve, but to deduct then a cost-price theory is simple-minded logic. It will be shown next that such logic is not only wrong, but also devastating.

[Graph](https://ibb.co/HLSHtcb)

The supply curve as illustrated in the graph shows a positive correlation between price and output. To increase output, the employer employs more labor. therefore, there seems to be a positive relation between workers and output price. However, the reason that a firm hires more labor is for a higher output price, not vice versa. To think in the vice versa direction is marxian garbage. Unless you are a monopolist, unnecessary hiring or wasteful spending is suicidal, i.e., killing your own company. marx's reasoning is vice versa: first labor then price, and therefore suicidal.
Marx's bad influence has ravaged so many developing countries. Some, seeing others’ successful accomplishments, simply copy their spending ratio, only to result in waste and destitution. some asian nations copies German education spending as a certain percent of GDP, its ministry of education is thus allocated with huge sum of budget, and by the end of every fiscal year it coerces its subordinate universities to begin an absurd spending spree. Those trying to be manage their budget responsibly will be punished for ineffective execution of budget. Such spending is wasteful If the waste requires further resource to maintain, it is absurd.
Such indiscriminate practice is not limited to one ministry, neither to the central level, but
it happens virtually everywhere, including to those (SOE's)state-owned enterprises. Of course, it is not limited to asian nations either. Indeed, even stupidity employing mArx's theory is also groundless garbage, as manifested by many communist regimes. The suicidal consequence is collosal deficit, massive buildip of national debt, consistent inflation and famine


This proves that the more valuable input, or a smarter laborer must diminish,not raise price. alternatively, laborer may increase output to contribute more profit. In contrast, Marx's labor theory of value uses only simplistic logic, which is patently false and injurious.",Conservative
Elon Musk takes aim at President Biden after he fails to mention Tesla during State of the Union ,Conservative
"Socialism supports Slavery George Fitzhugh (November 4, 1806 – July 30, 1881) was an American social theorist who published racial and slavery-based sociological theories in the antebellum era. He argued that the n\*gro ""is but a grown up child"" who needs the economic and social protections of slavery. Fitzhugh decried capitalism as practiced by the Northern United States and Great Britain as spawning ""a war of the rich with the poor, and the poor with one another"", rendering free blacks ""far outstripped or outwitted in the chase of free competition.""

He was a leading pro-slavery intellectual and spoke for many of the Southern plantation owners.

Fitzhugh: ""Slavery Justified"" (1849), Sociology for the South (1854) and Cannibals All! (1857).

His book, Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society was George Fitzhugh's most powerful attack on the philosophical foundations of free society. In it, he took on not only Adam Smith, the foundational thinker of capitalism, but also John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, and the entire liberal tradition. He attacked what he called ""private judgement"" which was the idea that people have a mind of their own and that the individual is the primary unit of moral and political value. He argued that free labor and free markets enriched the strong while crushing the weak.Sociology for the South is the first known English-language book to include the term ""sociology"" in its title.

""Slavery,"" he wrote, ""is a form, and the very best form, of socialism.""

""Socialism proposes to do away with free competition; to afford protection and support at all times to the laboring class; to bring about, at least, a qualified community of property, and to associate labor. All these purposes, slavery fully and perfectly attains. ... Socialism is already slavery in all save the master ... Our only quarrel with Socialism is, that it will not honestly admit that it owes its recent revival to the failure of universal liberty, and is seeking to bring about slavery again in some form.""

Cannibals All! was a sharp criticism of the system of ""wage-slavery"" found in the north - a term Fitzhugh popularised in America. Fitzhugh's ideas were based on his view that the ""n\*gro slaves of the South"" were considerably more free than those trapped by the oppression of capitalist exploitation.

He wrote: 'It is the duty of society to protect the weak;' but protection cannot be efficient without the power of control; therefore, 'It is the duty of society to enslave the weak.'

Fitzhugh popularised the economic principle that slavery was what makes civilised countries wealthy.

Fitzhugh's ideas in Cannibals All!, while often used in the defense of anti-abolition, have a more socially egalitarian undertone which attempted to remedy inequalities in ""Property of man.""

Fitzhugh was an extremely influencial intellectual in the Southern states. His ideas resonated with a lot of the influencial families there who saw themselves as protectors of black slaves. Many of those families preferred to keep their slaves during the time of industrialisation in the northen states. Abraham Lincoln is said to have been more angered by George Fitzhugh than by any other pro-slavery writer, yet he unconsciously paraphrased him in his House Divided speech.

Karl Marx and his ideas were happening on another continent at the time and were not as popular as Fitzhugh in those states. Therefore, his ideas of reform could be seen in terms of a non-Marxist socialist ideology. Over time, a lot of the pro-slavery writers came to adopt the principles of socialism. Fitzhugh described the southern slave plantation as ""the beau ideal of communism"".

**Additions**

James Henry Hammond, a democratic senator, consistently compared the South's ""well compensated"" slaves to the free labor of the North, describing the latter as ""scantily compensated"" slaves.

In his speech to the US Senate, in March 4, 1858, he said: ""In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life...It constitutes the very mudsill of society.""

Mudsill theory is the proposition that there must be, and always has been, a lower class or underclass for the upper classes and the rest of society to rest upon.

In November 1848, a socialist activist gave a speech at the 13th annual meeting of the Rhode Island Anti-Slavery Society that ""went on in an effort to show that wages slavery is as bad as chattel slavery.""

The abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass became infuriated with the socialist speaker and said ""The attempts to place holding property in the soil—on the same footing as holding property in man, was most lame and impotent"".

"The paradox of wealth Elon Musk has recently been quoted as saying that it makes no sense to take money away from people who've demonstrated great skill in capital allocation and give it to an entity with notoriously piss-poor  capital allocation. He is 100% correct in this assessment and I do not challenge it. However, it can also be observed that as a person or entity becomes increasingly wealthy, it also becomes increasingly inefficient at capital-allocation. Microsoft, for example, once paid a guy *one million dollars* to write a slug script for a Halo movie that ended up never getting made. No sane business would do this; I once transcribed *Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy* for free as a favor to some guy on Reddit that I didn't even know who was making some kind of fanfilm project. Wealth also helps to insulate people against the negative consequences of terrible decision-making, as there are a lot of problems that can be made to disappear by throwing money at them (though nowhere near as many as politicians like to think)

Lifestyle distinctions signal who is a member of the middle class, too,    Where your children go to school, [...] the kinds of foods you serve for dinner, the type of clothing you wear, the people you vacation with — all these lifestyle choices help to determine who fits into the middle class and who is excluded.

So the reason a whopping 70% of people say they are middle class has to do with how Americans want their income perceived.

When learning logic, teachers warn repeatedly that once you learn how to spot bad logic you'll see it everywhere.

It's much more to the point to warn logic students that they live in a society of child-like adults, and once you get one stage above conventional in logical reasoning, you'll never look at the concept of 'adults' in the same way ever again. 

It much more to reality to understand there are no adult in neoliberal USA.

Left activism is the worst example of an entire section of society run completely by adolescent mentality. 

Every issue, every identity, every subculture, every left publication, every respected academic and every part within the entire entity is run like a high-school glee-club. 

That didn't work to secure any justice for the working-class...but Leftist seem to have had fun the whole time. That's American adults. Anything they do to have fun is wonderful. That's the child-like attitude of all US adults, and left activism is not only included in that, but the most significant example of the societal problem. 

A metaphor for these words is pissing in the wind, because I think any leftist cares about progress. Leftist only care about making sure everyone knows they are good people since they make sure to stay angry about things they have no idea how to handle. Leftist only seek respect for their anger, and ideas are not needed. Just a 40 year virtue signaling narrative. 

The good leftists didn't do shit for the suffering working-class.

Leftist activism has no new ideas, doesn't accept any sort of thinking that is not what they've done for 50 years, and so has nothing but stagnation, regression and irrelevance in its future. 

Leftist already have and have given the people all the justice they're ever going to see. 


-------

&nbsp; 

The left can't mature because it doesn't want-to. Every one under neoliberalism demands to stay children for life, and leftist don't want to be left out of the American dream. 

It's boring to watch the thing screaming and only digging itself into a deeper. 

There's not a difference between Left activism and the morals of the ruling-class. Both tell you justice is not possible, but the psychotic leftists scream that it is possible at the same time. 

That's all you'll for your entire lifetime. You have decades of watching that dysfunctional and fraudulent justice movement. 

American is all bullshit. From the top to the bottom, it's one hedonistic juvenile culture.

"Art Inspired by Anarcho-Capitalism (""Bastiat Mask"" + Artist Statement) &#x200B;

[\\""Bastiat's Mask\\"" by Upton Ethelbah III](https://preview.redd.it/qm1efmlqcn131.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8578c5fee50ac4d36e49d051b023eb1d3c30ab42)

&#x200B;

This is an artwork I created in 2011 titled ""Bastiat Mask,"" inspired by the writings of the economic historian and social critic Frederic Bastiat, considered to be one of the great proto-Austrians.

&#x200B;

**Medium:**

framed digital inkjet print, newsprint paper, laserprint on copy paper, pencil, uncredited appropriated internet imagery, glue, photography, composited in Photoshop

&#x200B;

**Statement:**

“Bastiat Mask” is a likeness of the 19th-century French economic journalist Frederic Bastiat, manifest as a hastily fashioned, two-dimensional mask. It is the type of mask that can be held to one’s face, as in a masquerade ball, by the wooden stick that appears stapled to its bottom.

Curiously, rather than having two eye holes set in their traditional locations, Bastiat Mask features only one, cut into the middle of the forehead, the “third eye” position. It is the artist’s fantasy that, should one look through this supernatural eye hole as they adorn their faces with the mask, they would be able to see what Bastiat saw through his own mind’s eye. They would become privy to a worldview that renders the once-murky understanding of money and commerce instantly clear, their fractured thoughts about the nature of an economy mended, and erroneous notions about *laissez-faire* banished.

It is Bastiat’s mystical “third eye” that is singularly equipped to grant access to his vision precisely because it was an enlightened one, a vision that seemed to transcend the boundaries of mere mortal thought, even as it expanded them. In order to speak to one of the facets of a truly capitalist society, to honor private property (its keystone), whilst flaunting disdain for monopolistic “intellectual property” and the destructive statutory jungle it has spawned, the artist incorporates uncredited imagery, appropriated from the internet.",Conservative

Spokespeople from SpaceX and NASA did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday.

Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said it has been a “chaotic” orbit for the rocket booster, as every time it gets near the moon, the moon’s gravity tugs it into a slightly different path.

"If we are to break the two party system in the U.S. we need to start by taking people at their word not their political party Let me begin by saying that as a whole, everyone points to the right or left as groups.

I’ll give an example of myself, my flair is Liberty Leftist. I do this purposefully to show that just because my leanings are to the left, I shouldn’t be written off by my label. This morning I was in a thread and was met with a response of “Dumb Question. Are you a child or just a really dishonest leftist idiot?” For asking if charter schools are privately owned and operated. 

Now I get it, we all have disagreements inherently without question but if we are going to improve our system we need to be able to converse without assuming we know everything about someone because of their flair or a single belief they have. 

I’m a leftist who believes in your right to own a firearm. I’m a leftists who believes government subsidizing business is against the principles of a free market. I’m a leftist who believes a lot of things that the talking heads tell you are impossible for us to agree on. 

If libertarianism is to succeed in any meaningful way we have to understand that we can disagree on semantics and still agree on liberty. 

I am open to any criticism of myself or my ideas in this thread and hope we can find ways to meaningful dialogue without assuming someone is against you for disagreeing with you.

Edit: I’ve gotten multiple people asking me in DMs for proof that someone reacted to me this morning calling me a child or dishonest leftist idiot. I’ll make it easy and just post the thread.

"how to actually end racism  

Since racism is a feeling of hate that lives in peoples hearts, we have to be diligent and aggressive in attacking racism. Sorry, putting up signs at sports games won't do anything except for burn people out to the cause because the idiotic lack of effort making a sign takes.

if you make a sign that says end racism, you are a poser pretending to care enough to take action. all sign writers need to be shamed.

instead, we need to have a strict system of social and institutional powers that are obligated to report any instance of racism including verbal (the most important because it manifests itself verbally most of the time) and for institutional, muniscipal and lawful action to be taken to identify, document, investigate and eventually isolate any single person that engages in racism.

a white supremacist republican may only say the n word a few times in his/her/zer life before committing an act of hatred. we need a very strict social system that will work in tandem to identify every single racist person in our society.

once the racist people are gone, racism will no longer spread and multiply. like a virus, we need to be willing to take every measure no matter what in order to get rid of it.

"Monero is superior to Bitcoin and you can't change my mind There's literally no Logic that can be used to say that Monero's Privacy and Fungibility ON CHAIN aren't simply superior to Bitcoin. Another issue that needs to be addressed is that Monero is anti-ASICs mining and so is more decentralized, where any average joe can mine it. No Warehouses needed, no mass amount of wealth, no mining hierarchies based on wealth.

And when will the Bitcoin community see that Climate Change Regulation is going to come after these miners? First off, if you're running away from Regulation by moving to new locations, you're not actually free of Regulation. Secondly, ASIC-resisted mining like with Monero keeps the network decentralized, so that Regulating it is a lot harder as any regular person is capable of doing it. And you also can't regulate what you can't even see.

If you think $41k Bitcoin is a ""golden buying opportunity"", think again and look at $190 XMR.

"The NTOA, an organization that provides training guidelines and certifications for SWAT teams across the country, has released a statement saying they no longer support the use of “No Knock” raids. This could drastically decrease, if not completely eliminate the use of no knock raids in the United States.

***copied from my work email.  This was forwarded to the entire department by the SWAT commander who received it directly from NTOA.***

This message is shared on behalf of the NTOA and its Board of Directors.

 

No-knock warrant service has been the subject of many discussions over the past 30 years. These conversations often result in vigorous and passionate debates, and more often than not end with an agreement to disagree. Recent high-profile incidents have refocused the spotlight on this issue, resulting in renewed scrutiny and making no-knock warrants a key issue in the police reform movement.

 

We at the NTOA have had this same experience and are intimately aware of the complexities of this topic. As experienced law enforcement professionals, we appreciate the challenges facing policing, and our intent is not to add to those difficulties.

 

We can all agree that there is no easy answer, but there is a correct answer: No-knock search warrants, though well-intended, no longer pass the test of tactical science, risk mitigation practices, and liability-conscious decision-making.

﻿

The NTOA’s position on this is not new, nor is it a surrender to the forces of change. Still, we appreciate that this blunt and definitive statement is likely to cause angst and believe we must explain our reasoning.

 

﻿The NTOA was created with a mission to help save lives through training, education and tactical excellence, and has been teaching and writing about the no-knock issue for years. This mission has not changed.

 

No-knock is a legal/judicial exception to the constitutional knock-and-announce requirement. No-knock warrants became popular within policing during the “War on Drugs” of the 1980s. The fact that those dealing in illegal narcotics were often armed and had criminal histories involving violence, coupled with the threat of evidence destruction, created a dangerous challenge for law enforcement. As a result, law enforcement adopted the tactics of surprise, speed, and “violence of action” (intimidation). Law enforcement hoped that this combination would quickly overwhelm any resistance and avoid injuries.

 

The no-knock exception was the critical element to the surprise component of the tactics. It wasn’t long before no-knock became synonymous with dynamic entry/movement. Even today, the two terms are inextricably linked. The no-knock became a tactic used for many, if not most, warrants during the 1980s and early to mid-1990s. More often than not, these missions were successful, sometimes despite ourselves. Unfortunately, we also began to notice a pattern of SWAT officers losing their lives or being seriously injured. Multiple incidents of loss of life forced the NTOA and many agencies to re-examine how we managed risk and to seek alternatives to the no-knock “tactic.”

 

For years, the NTOA has advocated for the priority of safety and life, which drives strategic decision-making and critical thinking for the development of operational plans and orders. Tactical leaders and supervisors create these plans daily while sending personnel into harm’s way. These safety priorities are well known to all of us, but as a reminder, they are:

 

__1. Hostages/victims

__2. Innocent bystanders

__3. Public safety personnel (Police, EMS, Fire)

__4. Suspect(s)

__5. Drugs/evidence (Controlling objective)

 

Agencies initially used no-knock search warrants to protect the officer from violence and preserve evidence for the prosecution. Though the intent sounds reasonable and is noble in theory, the practice is flawed at its very core. Evidence is the controlling objective for most search warrants, which is the reason for the warrant’s planning and service. Though it is the controlling objective, we must apply sound risk mitigation principles to the problem to better serve the ultimate end state: “suspect(s) in custody and investigation to continue.” We understand the priorities of safety and life. We know from a critical thinking perspective how to build proper strategy to provide effective tactical resolution to the problem while maximizing safety.

 

For example, if the warrant is for the recovery of drugs, the no-knock warrant purpose is to preserve evidence. The safety priorities ensure the safety of the officers, innocent bystanders, and the suspect before preserving evidence. If the no-knock warrant is used based on the propensity of violence, this further violates the safety priorities. Stealth entry, approach, breaching of the door, crossing the threshold, or other covert means of access only risk the following scenarios:

 

__• The misidentification by the occupants of the police as intruders;

__• The compression of space and time negatively affects the ability to correctly interpret situations and the environment for both the police and occupants;

__• The misidentification of intent on the part of occupants and the police;

__• Police create an environment along with the suspect’s intentional or unintentional actions requiring correct interpretation from both sides, which often does not occur, leading to an unfortunate tragedy.

 

The NTOA’s template for sound, defensible risk mitigation is straightforward. Consider all aspects of the mission, including the objective(s), intelligence and applicable legal constraints. Next, consider all of the tactical options at your disposal, and then using the safety priorities, select the safest alternative possible to accomplish your mission. Finally, have the flexibility to adjust to the circumstances (exigency) as they present themselves.

 

The strategy and tactics developed on a search warrant should always speak to the safety priorities based on intelligence known to the officers. Applying tools and tactics that can be justified and supported by risk mitigation and the safety of all concerned within the environment is mandatory.

 

When considering the priority of safety and life, it is difficult, at best, to justify or defend no-knock warrant service. Lessons learned over many years and our desire not to repeat our past mistakes are the foundation for our position.  

 

The NTOA has one overriding objective: to save lives. Thank you all for your service.",Conservative

"stateless-society: How-to institutional knowledge I'm not a liberalist, capitalist or any other *ist* 
I'm simply looking to escape out of my echo-chamber/bubble.

**Context**

Large organizations like Governments perform lots of tasks, 
most of these are dependant on institutional knowledge.

This creates an enormous amount of momentum.

My observation is that distributed organizations that cropped up
online were only effective for a short while, like actions against ACTA etc.
Those were organized on social media platforms like facebook. But that platform has largely been neutralized by the advent of click-farms in Asia as well as algorithms
that optimize for happy-feelings rather than relevance.

The social media political movements have fizzled out, because nobody bothered
to create durable long-lasting connections or a method to preserve
institutional knowledge. 

Hence all the momentum has dispersed. There are more people then ever before that desire for socio-economic change, but all the rage and energy evaporates in rants rather then adding to the momentum of a movement that builds up until it can break through
the barriers put up by those that benefit from the status quo.

**My question** how to have a big organization with institutional knowledge & momentum without the trappings like corruption that accompany centralization & hierarchies.

"Does this sub sympathize with workers and their frustrations with the current system? Over the past two years, I've become a lot more sympathetic to working-class people than I ever was before. I grew up in a pretty sheltered upper-middle-class environment where I never wanted for anything, so it's really disheartening to hear how workers suffer on a daily basis. Issues like excessive working hours for very little pay, bad benefits, union-busting, poor treatment, being forced to work while a tornado destroys your warehouse and kills the workers, pissing in bottles, and other stories have made me kind of angry and a lot more sympathetic to poor workers. 

When you guys hear about workers' struggles, do you...feel for them? Like, at all? Do you agree that poor working conditions, excessive hours, and poverty wages are issues that need to be fixed? Your solutions may be different than the centre-left solutions of labour regulations and welfare, but do you believe that America's work culture and treatment of lower-level employees is flawed right now? 

I've always had this conception of libertarians as a bunch of sheltered and inconsiderate rich people and business owners who don't really care about the suffering of workers or poor people and just want to create an environment that favours the profits of the wealthy and big business over the dignity and well-being of the working masses.  

Personally, I completely understand why people are angry. Many workers can't afford food, shelter and medicine due to a lack of livable wages. People are being crushed by student loan debt and medical debt. Some people have to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet. During the pandemic, some 11 million Americans were behind on their rent and faced eviction, and it's literally [impossible for anyone working a minimum wage job to afford rent anywhere in the United States](https://reports.nlihc.org/oor). Some of the most important and essential workers, like janitors, waitresses, labourers, and others are paid really sickeningly low wages. People are fed up, and I don't find it hard to sympathize with them. There is a reason why huge swaths of people are becoming attracted to democratic socialism and anti-capitalism in the United States. When a system fails to provide for people or allow for them to provide for themselves and lead happy and dignified lives, they're going to become dissatisfied with the system. 

This stuff makes me mad. Hearing about people suffering makes me mad. Hearing about full-time workers not making enough to live, let alone afford things like health insurance or a  college degree, makes me mad. I want to live in a society that prioritizes well-being. 

For me, the ultimate measure of a society's success and the success of it's policies is human well-being. The more people with stable housing, living wages, healthcare, enough food, and the ability to go to college without going bankrupt, the better society will be. 

I'm not saying that we should start a socialist revolution and collectivize all of our workplaces, but I really do get pissed off when I hear about the struggles of workers and I understand why people are unhappy. I get pissed off when I learn that people work hard yet are still in poverty in the richest country in the world. 

I've heard from a lot of libertarians that the workers being paid poverty wages are being paid what they deserve and that it's on them to ""just get a better job"". But the world doesn't work that way. It's not as simple as ""just leave"". Generally, when people are working shitty jobs with poverty pay and bad working conditions, they would leave if they had another option. Do you seriously think that people would work such jobs if ""just leaving"" was that simple? Of course not! People stay in shitty jobs *because* they feel trapped in them. First of all, poor people can't just quit and spend months browsing Indeed for another job. They will starve or get evicted. 

Also, I don't believe that wages depend on the value produced by the worker and that said value is objective. Basically, libertarians tell people who work 70 hours a week for 7 bucks an hour that their wage is exactly equivalent to how much they produce, so it's what they deserve. I don't get this at all. Wages are just the exchange rate of a service. It depends on what the *employer is willing to pay you.* They are not objective, they are subjective. For example, McDonalds workers in Denmark get paid more than 20 dollars per hour due to a system of bargaining between unions and employers, and McDonald's prices in Denmark are not inflated. This makes me question the notion that poverty-paid workers are just less deserving of a living wage because they're not valuable enough to warrant that living wage. Are Danish McDonald's workers 2.8x more valuable and productive than American fast food workers? If they're both as valuable and as productive, then why is there such a massive pay difference? Workers know the value of their labour and know what they require, so in a fair system, they get to freely negotiate the alienation rate with their employer.

I've also heard it argued that minimum wage jobs were never ""meant "" to be breadwinner jobs and that they're for high school and college students working part time. First of all, per the data I cited earlier, single people can't even survive on their own working these jobs. This is also a red herring, since many underpaid jobs are not typical minimum wage jobs (construction, janitor, etc.). Second, the on-the-ground economic realities of the working class have nothing to do with your idealized principles of what certain jobs are ""meant"" for. The economy has played out such that many people *do* rely on jobs that you consider too menial to deserve a wage that pays for rent, groceries and healthcare. Also, what do you think happens when high school students and college students are at school or studying? In no way are these jobs exclusively for part-time high school and college students. These jobs are essential and commonplae, so these companies are absolutely propped up by full-time workers in these positions. 

The other thing that I find frustrating about libertarians is their attitude towards college and equality of opportunity. It goes like this:

Worker: I'm poor and work two jobs and can barely make rent each month

Libertarian: Maybe you should have gotten a better job

Worker: This is the only work I could get 

Libertarian: Maybe you should have gone to college and gotten skills that worth a middle class salary

Worker: I was born into a poor family, and we couldn't afford to send me to college. I'm barely making any money, so I can't afford it anyway.

Libertarian: Be born rich next time. 

It honestly seems like the United States is just becoming a place where being born rich is the ticket to prosperity, and where being born poor is a curse. It's not a meritocratic society where everyone has equal opportunities to succeed. Not even close. 

Sorry for the rant, but I just want to know whether libertarians sympathize with working-class problems like inequality of opportunity, poverty wages, and worker abuse.",Conservative

"The comeuppance of Gen X Was watching the super bowl last night and during the halftime show something really struck me: Gen X will have it's comeuppance in politics.  The boomers will become less relevant, and a new generation will take over. 

I was 15 years old when I got a copy of The Chronic on cassette (1993).  That was damn near 30 years ago. None of the other songs performed  last night were less than 20 years old. This puts me at late Gen X (1977; now 44 y.o.)

If our country can hold itself together for another 10 years it'll be Gen X who has the time and money to run for office. As the boomers are doing now, Gen X will have the chance to reshape our government in accordance with their values. Its hi-fucking-larious that Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre have become the standard bearers of at least a portion of those values. Anti-police, pro-gun, anti-drug war.

"Guess what, all the suffering we see today comes down to lack of Masculinity and Morality. Of course Putin is gonna attack Ukraine. All the western world leaders are a bunch of pussies who can't make up their mind, because they have too much to lose: ""what if my approval drops? What if energy prices go up? What if I get voted out in the next election?"" And overall, ""what if I lose my affluence and comfort?"" 

So their hands are tied and they can't fight back, even though all it takes is some temporary setback and a few cold nights to stop the Russians. If Churchill had worried about his own career in politics, if King George VI had worried about his throne, if the commoners had worried about losing their peaceful lifestyle, the UK would have joined Mussolini's ""peace talk"" and surrendered to Hitler. Of course, after the war, Churchill was voted out of office, and King George died of Lung Cancer due to the stress of the war. But hey, if they hadn't fought the war, they would probably have been better off personally. There's always sacrifice to take to do the right thing.

And it's not just the politicians, there are a bunch of pussies today among the western citizens too, whose number 1 priority is their affluence, comfort, and good vibes: ""I can't sleep at night because of the honks! I can't drive my Lamborghini cuz the roads are blocked! My beautiful city is full of rednecks I can't stand the bad vibes! Oh and I can't vote for Trump, he's too rude to everyone! And the coral reefs are going away cuz of CO2 and my poor little fishies! They're so cuuuute!""

So Putin, who's not a pussy and still a real man, seizes the opportunity and gets what he wants. Heck, if he didn't seize this opportunity, he himself would be a pussy too!

Masculinity is the backbone of the society. Fighting crime, disciplining children, building career, it all needs masculinity. And you don't have to be a man to possess masculinity. The mother who drags her kid to the police to turn himself in is beautifully masculine. It's all about taking responsibility, accountability, and doing what's right even if it's against our feelings. But no! All we care today is love, comfort, security, and good vibes. God forbids when we discipline our children, because we are afraid that they won't love us! We are afraid of everything, so we comply, we appease, and we hide.

Masculinity is severely missing in today's society. Until we get it back onto every man and woman, no amount of protest or audit or law suits or midterm election will fix anything. 

For those who are afraid of Masculinity because it represents violence, they are right. Masculinity will produce violence without Morality. Is Trudeau masculine? Hell yea, he has the guts to invoke emergency act AND execute it even before it gets passed in Parliament. He showed his power and resolution, but he has no Morality. He doesn't care whether it's right to do this to the peaceful protesters. He knows that the constitution allows him to do it, and that more than half of Canadians support him, so he does it - because he can and there won't be any consequences (in this life, at least). 

Throughout the COVID pandemic, the politicians and scientists together played the entire humanity like rats in a lab. They impose indiscriminate mandates onto everyone because they can - because the law allows them to, and there aren't any consequences. They don't need to take responsibility for people who died from vax side effects or mishandled public health policies. Andrew Cuomo had to resign because of sex scandal, not because his policies killed old New Yorkers. Fauci had never been right about anything, and yet he's still the highest paid public health official. All of us are just suckers, cannon fodder, and lab rats to them, because they have no Morality.

And that's why there are so many lawyers in America. Everyone hires lawyers not to ensure justice, but to avoid or minimize punishment for bad things they did. They don't care about right or wrong - just as long as the law allows it, they will do anything to protect their self-interest.

We often say that freedom, democracy, science, and law are the foundation of western civilization. To this I call bullshit. Without Morality, freedom is nothing but indulgence. Democracy is nothing but tyranny of the majority. Science is nothing but fake numbers to deceive the common people. Law is nothing but a tool to protect the ""right"" to indulge and to oppress the minority. Even religion, something that should be closest to Morality, without it becomes only a way to justify indulgence and evil, and to remove the guilt. After a solemn Sunday service, a church go-er will immediately cheat on his wife the next day, only to confess to a priest later and then do it again.

What we are experiencing today, the rigged election, the botched Afghanistan retreat, the inflation, the empty store shelves, the vaccine mandates, and the Russian invasion, are all signs from God. I'm guessing that God is delivering these onto us because He wanted us to wake up and see that all the things we value today, the freedom, the democracy, the science, and the law - are all a bunch of lies without Morality. And here's the bad news: if it comes from God, nothing and nobody can stop it. Again, no amount of protests, ballot audits, law suits to the Supreme Court, or midterm elections will stop these. And there are more adversities to come until we either wake up, or die out. Your feelings hurt? Sorry. God doesn't care about your feelings, because He only cares for you to be good and act good.

So, what can we the people do right now to fix things? Nothing. We are powerless against God's will. But we can save our own souls (though we can't guarantee that we can save our own lives in this life) by understanding the message, the real reason why things are so bad now. And the first step is to understand why we support Trump: not because his policies can bring us affluence and security or whatever, but because he's on the side of Masculinity and Morality.",Conservative

So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear, that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by the free-enterprise system.""  Milton Friedman ",Conservative

"10 Days Ago Joe Biden Assured Ukrainian Leader Zelensky that US Would Respond “Swiftly and Decisively” to Russian Aggression — On Friday Joe Left for Delaware By Jim Hoft

Published February 25, 2022 at 8:26pm

&#x200B;

What a difference one week makes!

&#x200B;

10 days ago on Sunday, February 13, Joe Biden assured Ukrainian leader Zelensky that the US and allies would respond “swiftly and decisively” if Russia invaded Ukraine.

&#x200B;

CNN reported on the phone call.

&#x200B;

President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a roughly hour-long call Sunday that the US would respond “swiftly and decisively” if Russia takes further steps toward invasion, according to a White House readout of the call.

&#x200B;

The call came amid US warnings that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen as soon as this week.

&#x200B;

“President Biden made clear that the United States would respond swiftly and decisively, together with its Allies and partners, to any further Russian aggression against Ukraine. The two leaders agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence in response to Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders,” according to the White House readout.

&#x200B;

Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday.

"How would an anarcho-capitalist nation protect against an aggressor nation with a stronger military, due to higher taxes? Hello,

Libertarian learning ancap, currently working through my understanding of how society can replace the government (even if it's a small one).

Consider China, or the US. Compared to ancap philosophy, they both have low personal freedoms and high taxes. They can use these taxes to fund extremely strong militaries.

In an anarcho-capitalist nation (Is there such thing? How do borders work?), we'd theoretically pay a ""military"" company. I find it highly doubtful that the free market would be able to produce a military of comparable strength, due to competition. In most cases, a hegemony of power is bad, but the military (when protecting from aggressor nations), this hegemony is good.

3. If they only criticise capitalism, make comparisons to socialism. 
4. Push back on straw manning. Point it out or reconnect it with reality. For example, change 'profit' into 'long term profit'.

"Question about Subjective Theory of Value So I understand the concept that goods or services have no intrinsic value, only that which is placed on them by the individual, but does this value have any bearing on the market price of that good or service? It makes sense to me that in the short-term the price would reflect the subjective value placed on it, but in the long-run (in a perfectly competitive market) the price would only reflect the marginal cost.

Say a consumer values a banana at 10 utils. He goes to the market and finds only one banana vendor, selling them for 8 utils. Let's say the cost of producing a banana is 1 util. In the short-term the vendor can price disciriminate and maximize profits, but in the long-term more firms are attracted to the profit-rich market. Unless the firms collude (and assuming they sell an identical product), wouldn't there be a race to the bottom to out-compete the competition, with the market price ultimately falling until it hits marginal cost at which point no firm could go lower and still make a profit? Am I missing something crucial?",Conservative
"Are layoffs unethical? A major organizational change has occurred at the company my mother works for (a very large and powerful fortune 500 company), and I'm very worried about the possibility of her being laid off. I don't think it's a very likely scenario at all, but anything is possible.

She's the breadwinner of the family and makes very good money, so if she were to lose her job, I would be completely screwed. I'm a full-time engineering student who doesn't have a job.

Do you guys think that layoffs are unethical unless they're necessary for the company to avoid bankruptcy?

I don't think it's fair that a person who's done everything right, played by the rules, and shows loyalty to the company deserves to have their livelihood and the livelihoods of their dependents destroyed because some suit in a boardroom decided to rEoRgAnIzE. If the alternative is bankruptcy, then I might understand. However, if the goal is superficial or profit-minded, I can't see the justification.

EDIT: This is more about the consequences of layoffs for the population at large, and not my specific situation. My mother will likely get a beefed-up severance package due to her considerable seniority and stature in the company, we own a home with no rent or mortgage due, and I would be able to work part-time. However, many people are far less lucky. Younger people with less seniority raising younger dependents who won't be able to work will be utterly screwed over. ",Conservative

"What is the libertarian position on the Ukraine conflict? Donetsk and Lugansk are the two separatist territories in Ukraine at play here(collectively known as the Donbas region), the leaders of these areas are backed by Russia. They had a vote on 2014( The 2014 Donbas referendum) to officially separate from Ukraine and become an independent republic which passed: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/11/eastern-ukraine-referendum-donetsk-luhansk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/11/eastern-ukraine-referendum-donetsk-luhansk)

These people democratically voted to separate themselves from Ukraine but Ukraine and other countries internationally failed to recognize their democratic vote. Ukraine has been shelling these two cities ever since in order to beat them into submission and force them to stay part of the country.

Minks agreement was enacted in 2014 to calm down the carnage that was going on in the region as a temporary solution. Everything in the Donbas region was to be done ""On temporary Order of Local Self-Governance in Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts"",  so they got some self-governance but had to comply with most of Ukraine's rules and there was a ceasefire.

There were multiple violations to the ceasefire after the Minks protocol was enacted though and Ukraine kept bombing the Donbas region. Russia has now become the first country to recognize the 2014 Donbas referendum and assert these two cities are indeed two separate republics, it is now to responding to the shelling the separatist have been dealing with for years from the Ukranian side.

People see this as a random invasion into Ukraine but that seems to be far from the truth. These two regions were already largely separated from Ukraine and  even voted to separate themselves from the country. Their leadership is Russia backed and has been fighting Ukrainian aggression for years now. Looks to me like Putin is responding to the Ukrainian aggression on these two cities. Then again Russia could just want to annex them and is using that as a pretext.

"The state as cheapest property protection I think all anarchists agree that the modern state serves to protect the upper class and wealth stratification. My understanding of anarcho-capitalist theory is that if the state is abolished, the privilege current capitalist enterprises (corporations, etc) have will also be dissolved. I agree with this, but I'm unsure about why capitalists would want that, and why capitalists in an anarchist society would keep society stateless. 

I've often heard that in anarcho-capitalist society private property will be protected by private security forces. This makes me queasy because why wouldn't capitalists just support the formation of a state and have their workers pay for the protection of private property through taxes?

Like Proudon talks about in Property is Theft,  it is the working class that pays for the protection of capitalists' property. It is unjust because capitalists don't pay an appropriate amount of money for their proportion of protection they receive from the state. While i think we can all agree that this is unjust, that does not mean people will not support it or that such a system will not come into being.

To me, the state, funded by working class taxes, is an ideal way for the capitalists to protect their property, whereas in an anarcho-capitalist society, capitalists would actually have to pay for their property's protection and incur the costs. So, the idea of the state not reconstituting itself in an ancap society makes me skeptical because there is financial incentive for capitalists to just agree to form a state over the entirety of society because then they skip out on a large majority of the cost of defense, shifting the costs onto lesser/non-property owners and keeping the wealth they would have spent on protection to themselves. This is mostly worrisome because this motive is rooted in the mechanics of market competition that capitalists support.

TL;DR If there is financial incentive for capitalists to support the formation of a state by shifting the costs of property protection onto working class taxpayers, why wouldn't they do it an an anarcho-capitalist society?   ",Conservative

"Give this to friends who want to be cops Turn Away From the State

Why do you want to be a cop?  Do you realize that every person that you initiate force(stop, search, fine, imprison, assault, kill) against for a victimless crime like;

drug possession/use

wrong sticker on their car

expired license

no seatbelt

no permit

failure to pay taxes

failure to pay fines

etc

is actually in truth a crime committed by you.  You are aggressing against that person because that person has harmed no one.  It doesn't matter what the law says, the law was wrong when cops enforced slavery and it's wrong now.  Every time you initiate force against someone who hasn’t harmed anyone, you are the aggressor and the bad member of society, not them.  

All vices contain within them their own punishment; addiction, relationship problems, loss of job, etc.  This is punishment enough.  It is wrong to lock people in cages who have not harmed others.  A person buying a drug from a drug dealer is engaging in a voluntary human interaction, capitalism at work.  If someone wants to sell something and someone wants to buy it-as long as they are not harming anyone else directly-there is no crime.  The drug war is a massive power grab by the state.  It allows them to use asset forfeiture laws to seize billions, protect the fascist pharmaceutical racket, protect the fascist alcohol racket, protect the plastic industrial complex, create a prison industrial complex, create a permanent underclass and a police state.  The drug war is a not a war on drugs, it's a war on people.  You are playing a key role in perpetuating it by aggressing against peaceful people.  If someone on drugs robs a store or kills someone, that person should face the consequences for violating the property rights of others.  However, there is no property right violation and no victim in using, buying, possessing or selling a substance.

Consider all the families you will tear apart.  The children whose fathers and mothers you will put in cages for all manner of victimless crimes.  Imagine the suffering you will cause them, when they ask: “Why won’t they let my mommy or daddy come home?”  It should be you who are forced to look that child in the eyes and tell them why you took their mommy or daddy away.  By destroying families you have recreated in the next generation the cycle of drug abuse and interfamilial violence that broken families create.  How many have you condemned to suffer in terrible government “shelters”?  Shame on you.

It's not your fault because you’re just following orders right?  Wrong, morality applies to you regardless of what uniform you wear.  It is your fault and there is nothing noble or heroic about surrendering your morality and blindly obeying authority.  A life serving the state will eventually eat away at you, you will come to see the pain you have caused others.  It will haunt you.  Much the way veterans who committed crimes in distant lands suffer mentally for their submission to the state and crimes against humanity, invading countries who never attacked them, kicking down doors, killing people, etc.  Unless you are a psychopath/sociopath you will be eaten away inside, your profession has unusually high numbers of them.  

Why not get a real job? Contribute to society.  Right now you’re taking and causing pain and suffering.  Where does your pay check come from?  It comes from taxation.  Taxation is theft.  When you take something that doesn't belong to you by force-whether you have agents do it for you or you do it yourself-it is theft.  

There is a truth called self-ownership.  I own myself, you own yourself.  We don't own other human beings.  I can only control that which I own.  I could only ""tax"" that which I control.  I can't go next door demanding a portion of my neighbors’ income because he is not my property.  A group that claims it has the right to take by force, makeup law and force it on others is a group that is asserting ownership over others.  No one has a higher claim to my life or my body than I do, it doesn't matter what uniform an aggressor wears.  Anyone claiming to own others as property is resting on false authority and is a tyrant.

But what about the social contract?  I never signed any social contract.  A contract that is made with someone before they are able to consent (birth) is an invalid contract by any legal measure.  A valid contract must have a meeting of the minds, the terms must be clearly outlined, understood and agreed upon.  The social contract has none of these qualifications.  It is a myth.

Let me ask you a philosophical question...If you as an individual do not have a right to go next door to your neighbors’ house and demand a portion of his income, how can you delegate that right to a  ""majority""?  How can one delegate a right which he himself does not possess?  It doesn't matter what uniform you wear, stealing is stealing, no “majority” will ever make that which is wrong right.

What is democracy anyway?  It is not even 51% forcing their will on 49%.  Sure the votes may be reported as 51% voted for X, 49% against X, but consider that most people do not even vote.  If more people don’t vote than vote will the state bow its head and dissolve?  It will not, more proof the state is a criminal gang that with illegitimate authority.  If a majority votes to hang a man, does that make it right? What of the man who enforces the will of the “majority” on the minority if the will he is enforcing is morally wrong?  

Ever notice how the state makes up words to hide what it's really doing? For example:

taxation is theft

war is mass murder

collateral damage is murder

asset forfeiture is theft

eminent domain is theft

jails are cages

etc

,they never say what they are truly doing.  This is a sign of brainwashing and propaganda.

People in the market who produce goods and services for the benefit of society are the real heroes.  Men and women who drive semi-trucks across massive distances to bring you goods, the employee who pushes your grocery cart back to the store in freezing weather, the doctor who tries his best to save people, the volunteer who risks his/her health caring for poor people in 3rd world countries, these are real heroes.  Soldiers and police officers are not heroes, they are people who have chosen to blindly follow authority, ignore their conscience and earn a living by parasitically taking from others who are subjected to the illegitimate rule of the state and its’ enforcers.

What good or service do you provide?  You say you provide security or law and order, but what does that mean?  How can those who claim to secure rights do so by violating the property rights of others to earn a paycheck?  How can you say what you do is a service when it's monopolized and everyone is forced to pay for it whether they want your “service” or not?  If Walmart was the only store allowed to provide groceries we would get bad service, high prices and bad products. Competition provides the best products and services.  Why monopolize and prevent competition?

Consider a market based organization.  If they do a bad job, they go out of business.  They receive signals from customers in the form of lost revenue, this tells them they need to change something.  Monopolized state organizations do not receive those signals because their money comes through force, they do not earn it voluntarily from willing customers.  If you want to provide protection and security without extorting people at gunpoint, look into Detroit Threat Management.  It is a free market organization that is so successful at providing security that it protects the poor for free.  DTM have never killed any of their customers.  Governments do not have customers-they only have slaves.  DTM is just one model for how we could provide security in the absence of the state, the market is infinite no one knows what people would engineer to provide security.  In the market, the best idea wins-as opposed to the state's authoritarian top down monopolistic one way of doing things.

Have you considered what you really do?  What do you do with a majority of your time?  You enforce laws; you look for people with the wrong color sticker on their car, people traveling faster than an arbitrary speed limit, people possessing a substance the state deems illegal, people doing business without permission from the gang in charge, etc.  All things with no victim.  It's not your job to ""protect and serve"", the supreme court has ruled on numerous occasions that cops have no duty to protect anyone.  What does it mean to “enforce law”?  Politicians write laws and if you are an enforcer for laws then you are an enforcer for the arbitrary whims of politicians.  You enforce whatever the politicians call ""law"".  That makes you a hired gun for the gang in charge.  Every law is actually a gun pointed at someone.  If I refuse to pay a seatbelt fine they will send a mean letter.  If I ignore that they will send men like you with guns to collect.  If I resist they will cage or kill me.  Every law is nothing more than a gun pointed at everyone (except the elite) and you are the one holding the gun.

One of the key functions police perform for the state is to create a fascist market.  In a market where participants are subject to the rule of a central authority, that central authority will form corrupt relationships with market firms.  They will scratch each others backs.  The government will get goods and services from the firm, the firm will get more regulations from the government which the ill-informed believes are for protecting them but in fact are for preventing competition to the firms favored by the state. The state favors large firms because it makes it easier to impose regulation and makes tax collection easier when there are massive employee payrolls as opposed to many small firms to keep track of.  The result is a few large powerful corporations who play friendly with the state and use state power to dominate everyone else.  Ever notice the revolving door between ex-pharmaceutical CEO/Monsanto CEO and FDA positions of power?  What of the military industrial complex ex-CEO’s gravitating to decision making positions in the military?  Without cops there would be no one to stop someone from competing against monopolistic firms and we would eventually see much smaller companies with much more aggressive competition working harder to provide cheaper, better quality products faster.  Companies like Yelp, Underwriters Laboratories, Urban Spoon and others are already doing a better job keeping customers safe than the state is.  An unintended consequence of your service to the state results in more expensive, poorer quality goods for everyone.

But what would exist without government? Wouldn't people be killing each other, raping and pillaging? On the contrary, that's exactly what the state does with its’ constant law making, regulation, taxation and wars.  To see the worst of society, simply look at government.  If the state disappeared tomorrow there would be a small period of disorder, but over time people would provide services like road building, security, infrastructure, etc.  Why would people do this?  Because they can make a profit doing so.  The free market has every tool we need to run the world, we don't need coercive murderous monopoly gangs.  The profit motive is all we need to have an orderly society.  People acting peacefully can provide everything you think we need a state for.  Besides, 99.99% of peoples’ lives are lived in anarchy.  We don't walk around with cops on our sides at all times.  Cops are few and far between, society functions just fine without them.  Business will go on, life will go on.

The idea that there is a special moral exemption for the state than for individuals is actually a religious belief called statism.  The truth is that morality applies across the board, no matter what uniform you wear.  Religions typically have rituals that assist in brainwashing their followers.  Consider the rituals of the state; 

Pledge of Allegiance (illogical/perverse devotion to cult)

"How’d the billionaires get so much extra wealth? For one, the stock market. The uber-rich owe a big hat tip to the Federal Reserve, which plowed tens of billions of dollars into financial markets every month while keeping interest rates near zero . Throughout the year, American lawmakers' proposals for a so-called billionaire tax were derided, rather unsurprisingly, by superbillionaires such as Musk. The Tesla CEO, who in recent years has paid little or no income tax and whose now-trillion-dollar car company was partly built on government aid, has been especially vocal in opposing a tax on the uber-wealthy to fund a more robust social safety net in America.

Since the pandemic began, America's billionaires have seen their collective fortunes soar more than 70% to more than $5 trillion, according to a report by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies Program on Inequality, which analyzed Forbes data.

Democrats argue that billionaires' windfall alone over the past two years would be enough to pay for President Joe Biden's social infrastructure plan. But the billionaire tax legislation was dead on arrival this fall when Senator Joe Manchin voiced concerns about penalizing ""people in the stratosphere.""


Since the start of the pandemic, America’s wealthiest have seen their collective fortunes soar more than 70% to more than $5 trillion. If the government taxed just the gains accrued in the last two years — which, again, were made possible by the Fed — the rich would remain thoroughly rich and the country could fund a more robust social safety net.
 
That was the Democrats’ plan this fall. But, rather unsurprisingly, the so-called billionaire tax faced resistance from – wait for it – billionaires.

"So... we seized $7 billion of Afghan central bank reserves kept at the Fed.... While it seems we intend to redistribute half of them to Afghanistan in the form of humanitarian aid, the other half will go to 9/11 victims (WTF). The move will drain most of the Afghan central bank’s capital, further perpetuating a currency crisis and a banking system collapse. 

I probably wouldn’t have an issue if we seized $7 billion worth of heroin... but this is just wrong. On so many levels. 
It sets an awful precedent and sends the wrong message to other less than stable regimes. 

Why couldn’t they keep the reserves at the Fed until a legitimate government was in place? Why not limit access to the funds, not allowing transfer out but allowing the funds to be used for currency stabilizing operations? If the Taliban is not the legitimate government, how can we take these funds and earmark them for payout of lawsuits against the Taliban? What gives us the right to seize another nation’s legally acquired reserves in the first place? 

I know our use of the financial system to wreck countries is nothing new, but it deeply saddens me that these actions don’t receive more scrutiny. Bad actors always find ways around the measures and the people suffer. In corrupt states,  people aren’t going to rebel against the bad actors or vote them out of office, so economic warfare isn’t a means to an end. It’s an end in and of itself and it’s cruel. An economic collapse affects the entire population for years to come. If anything, it’s a great way to inspire terrorism, not discourage it.

"New Mexico passed a bill to increase teacher salaries by setting 3 salary tiers across the state. Tier 1: 1st year teachers will make a minimum of $50,000. Tier 2: teachers with 3-5 years of experience will make a minimum of $60,000. Tier 3: more experienced teachers will make a minimum of $70,000. See a video explaining the bill [here](https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1494339403371536400?t=IGoQdwTw5RPJ85nal2OACg&s=19). It's good to see New Mexico setting a standard for teacher salaries. Though we'd like to see even higher salaries for teachers, New Mexico's cost of living is below average, ranked as the [12th most affordable state to live in](https://meric.mo.gov/data/cost-living-data-series) (12/50 most affordable to least affordable). The tiers too are a good way to ensure that all teachers make a livable wage across the state. As a comparison, I live in California, the 3rd most expensive state to live in (48/50 on a scale of most affordable to least affordable), and I make $56,000 a year with a masters degree as a 5th year teacher. This is less than New Mexico's 2nd tier.

"Demolishing The communist spending(keynesian) blunder Saving is not Hoarding, there's major difference.

Hoarding is keeping a stockpile of money in a vault or under your bed. Saving on the otherhand is loaning it to banks which later circulate the financial market to fund other capital. Saving is the only force behind wealth as opposed to keynesian spending that kills of value by debasing a currency through indiscriminate printing. i called it keynesian because keynesianism is socialism. it goes along with Marx's Socialist policies In Communist manifesto where marx pointed out specific means to transfer wealth from the wealthy to the poor through progressive taxes,higher interest rates,inheritance taxes,wealth taxes,welfare states. This socialist phase is a precursor to the ""soymunist utopia"" marx longed for so its imperative to demolish this preposterous idea that discourages saving.


John Gaynard Keynes utilises income in order to derive his consumption function and spending multiplier. he also  require interest rate to bolster a positive consumption line. but,when the majority of households are included, such positive possibility is disproved


He postulates a different consumption function, which forms the basis of his fiscal theory. The image i provided illustrates the function, where the x-axis measures income, and y-axis spending. This function has a + intercept and a + slope. The + consumption line derives Keynesian multiplier. I will prove that the same Keynesian drivel to prove that such consumption line cannot be positive, to demolish the multiplier delusion.


John gaynard keynes dedicates couple of chapters to rescue his marginal inclination to consume, or the positive slope of the consumption line. His justification include: (1) A change in wage-unit; (2) A change in the discrepancy between income and net income; (3) sudden changes in capital-values not allowed for in calculating net income; (4) Changes in the rate of time-discounting, for example in the ratio of exchange between present goods & future commodity; (5) Changes in fiscal policy; (6) Changes in expectations of the relation between the present and the future level of income; (7) Any other subjective factors.
These are the factors that may influence the shape of the consumption line or may shift it, to be precise,Keynes considered income as more valuable than interest rate.and we will prove the opposite

 The Combination of Interest Rate & income
If someone works for a single period, but lives for 2 periods, he will budget his income between  2 periods in order to maximise his total utility, which is supposed to be:
(A)U =logC1 +logC2.
considering that person has only the first period income, Y, his budget constraint is:
(B)C1 + 1 C2 =Y, 1+i
where 2nd period consumption should be discounted by interest rate, i. 
Maximise (A)subject to (B)to achieve the following solutions:
C1 = 0.5Y , and C2 = 0.5(1 + i)Y .

Alternatively, if that individual has income from the 2nd period, his budget constraint becomes:
(B') C1(1+i)+C2 =Y , and the utility maximizing solutions are:
C1 = 0.5Y , and C2 = 0.5Y . 1+i



We may plot the corelation between consumption & income graphically. Since Y may be income from Period 1 or 2, there are 2 different graphs. consider for the moment that Y happens to be from Period 2. Given positive interest rate, the higher Period 2 consumption associated with the income may deliver the Keynesian positive consumption line, as illustrated in (B) If interest rate is zero, the consumption line will be a horizontal line. In this regard, Keynes requires interest rate to support his theory. though, there is another graph.
suppose next that income is from Period 1. Since the second period has no income, C2 is the intercept. If the interest rate is zero, both consumptions are identical, and the consumption line is horizontal. If interest rate is positive, C2 is the larger than C1, the slope of the consumption line is negative, as depicted in (C) If employment or lifespan is not certain, or if future income is expected to decline, people will save a bigfer proportion of their income, and the slope will be further diminished.

Now Keynes consumption line can be positive or negative, but provided that more people work in Period 1, the consolidated or averaged line could not be positive.
A higher income, i:e because of government’s consumption cash voucher, just shifts the consumption line upward, but does not change its slope. This shifting has been misunderstood by Keynesian economists as a positive relation between income and consumption.
Milton Friedman’s  45 degree permanent consumption line could also be explained by this model. If this country has only two people,one is working and the other is not, the total income must be Y, and C1+ C2=Y, whatever amount Y may be. The empirical result may deviate from 45 degrees  because of the existence of interest rate.

 John Gaynard Keynes' consumption line couldnt be positive. Without a positive consumption line, any addition of government spending do not increase income more than proportionately. There's no multiplier any more, and Keynes' fiscal policy becomes unsubstantiated.

Keynesianism is the communist's sneaky way to destroy capitalism. let's not allow that to happen

"How are you a libertarian supporting the actions of the Canadian government? I just saw a post where one of these so called “libertarians” is essentially supporting the actions of the Canadian government and police regarding the freedom convoy protests. 

How are you going to call yourself a libertarian and then say that the government freezing your bank account is just very standard and ok. If the government can take control of your assets because of your political affiliations you should be concerned as this is pretty frightening.

The comments are no better either, where another “libertarian” says that the police only bumped a few people, with a 900 pound animal, which could easily cause permanent injuries or death, all because someone was exercising their right to protest. These police officers have no business knocking people over with horses and it’s unacceptable as the protestor was non violent. 

I’m also not sure how you can call yourself a libertarian and support these police officers who are enforcing the tyranny of the state rather than stepping down or refusing to enforce some of these nonsensical laws. 

Anyways if you want to support the state here go ahead, it’s your right, but don’t sit here and call yourself a libertarian because you’re not, you’re a conservative.

"Representative Democracy has failed in Australia and led to COVID-authoritarianism (obviously). To determine whether or not representative democracy is effectively working in Australia, we need to consider what the goals of representative democracy are. The primary goal of representative democracy is for the representation of the people and their views and said fulfillment of their views by said representatives. When considering this, it is important to say that in Victoria, the ALP, in which the current state administration is incarnated within, has a polling majority rate of 45%, whereas their primary opposition has 30% as of January 2022. So, under this criteria, representative democracy is effective. However, I would argue that representative democracy should have and does have a wider criteria to gauge its success. And the Australian government agrees with me:

&#x200B;

""Respect for individuals, and their right to make their own choices. Tolerance of differences and opposing ideas. Equity—valuing all people, and supporting them to reach their full potential. Each person has freedom of speech, association, movement, and freedom of belief. Respect for individuals and their right to make their own choices. Tolerance of differences and opposing ideas. Equity, valuing all people and supporting them to reach their potential. Each person has freedom of speech, association, movement, and freedom of belief. Justice, treating everyone fairly in society and in court, and tolerance of differences and opposing ideas."" - Parliamentary Education Office, source: [peo.gov.au](https://peo.gov.au)

Considering ""their right to make their own choices"", and ""tolerance of opposing ideas"" is characterised as a legitimate characteristic and key principle of a representative democracy according to the Australian government, then that aspect of representative democracy is failing, and is, therefore, an ineffective aspect of Australian democracy. The reason as to why this is failing is because of vaccination mandates, which does not allow tolerance of opposing ideas, 262 days of forced lockdown (which is literally house arrest in all but name) for all citizens in Melbourne, which does not allow people to make their own choices, and economic vaccine apartheid (the ability to be fired for vaccine status, which is an infringement of civil rights). Furthermore, journalists were, during lockdowns, selectively picked by the government which is a direct concern and violation of freedom of the press which is directly linked to freedom of speech, if the two are not one and the same. Additionally, freedom of movement is also being encroached upon with the entire fundamental aforementioned existence of lockdowns. Again, freedom of association has been infringed upon by the state government of Victoria, due to the very core tenet of lockdowns prohibiting and inhibiting who you can meet and converse with in person. Furthermore, according to the Australian government source as cited, ""respect for human dignity"" is a direct 'benefit of democracy'.  According to [humanrights.gov.au](https://humanrights.gov.au), which is another apparatus of the Australian government, 'human dignity' is defined as ""our society's commitment to the notion that everyone can enjoy their rights and freedoms on an equal footing,"" which has clearly been infringed upon with the rampant dissolution of our rights as Australians within Victoria. Even though everything that has been mentioned so far has been within a state (Victoria) scale, this has dire reflections and consequences for the rest of Australia, as the very fact that the federal government has tolerated and even engaged within some of the prohibitions against 'human dignity' speaks volumes upon the future and definition of Australian representative 'democracy'. To break it down, Australia has lost its right to call itself, upon its own definitions, a 'representative democracy' for the time being, and therefore it is obvious that representative democracy is inefficient in the current Australian political climate and situation. However, this is not an argument against democracy itself, it just highlights its flaws and how it is in jeopardy as we speak within Australia. This is what COVID-based measures do, they form authoritarian democracy. If we want to in the long-term keep our democratic values alive, and liberty perhaps as an extension of such, we cannot tolerate COVID-authoritarianism of any type, and ironically this is all in fact in violation of ""key principles of Australia's democratic system"" despite all being pursued and enacted by our 'representative democracy'.",Conservative

"The Forgotten Depression: 1921: The Crash That Cured Itself In 1920, the American economy entered what would presently be diagnosed as a depression.  The successive administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding met the downturn by seeming to ignore it -- or by implementing policies that an average 21st century economist would judge disasterous.  Confronted with plunging prices, incomes and employment, the government balanced the budget and, through the newly instituted Federal Reserve, raised interest rates.  By the lights of Keynesian and monetarist doctrine alike, no more primitive or counterproductive policies could be imagined.  Yet by 1921, a powerful, job-filled recovery was under way.  This is the story of America's last governmentally unmedicated depression.

"What is the Capitalist view of Distributism? Distributism (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of Catholic social teaching, especially the teachings of Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Rerum Novarum and Pope Pius XI in Quadragesimo Anno.

According to distributists, property ownership is a fundamental right and the means of production should be spread as widely as possible rather than being centralized under the control of the state (state socialism), a few individuals (plutocracy), or corporations (corporatocracy). Distributism therefore advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership.

Co-operative economist Race Mathews, argues such a system is key to bringing about a just social order.

Distributism has often been described in opposition to both socialism and capitalism,which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitative. Thomas Storck argues that “both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. Further, some distributists argue that socialism is the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism’s concentrated powers eventually capture the state, resulting in a form of socialism. In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life”.",Conservative

I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but I recently saw a TikTok stating Centrism is bad and is like being a bystander and they claimed neutrality doesn’t exist. I’ve only just turned voting age but I’ve always thought my political opinion depends on what I think is best at any given moment. When the UK was asking if we should leave the EU I would have said no, which is seemingly a leftist opinion but just because I sometimes agree with the left doesn’t mean I am left.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with being leftist (other than far left of course) I just don’t like to be on one or the other end of the spectrum because I don’t see how you can stick with one side of the argument all the time? And just because I’m more neutral doesn’t mean I’m a bystander to moral issues. Or I think people need to compromise on everything. For me it’s about floating in between.

He viewed himself as a Marxist intellect, above others, who can, somehow, single-handedly led the entire campus to a proletariat revolution. Whenever someone argued him, he basically became a Socialist version of Ben Shapiro. He is educated but not critical. The only way to shut him down is to argue his logic against him with facts and data. How can I effectively argued against a guy like that?

[This is his document of his research and arguments ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Zpc4Gv75atnLR5wozsbOxCrTehLMpBVcozb3ZTMCA8/edit)

He said very lengthy sentences with big words that makes him sounds smart. It’s hard to keep track what he saying but few main points: Capitalism served the interest of making profits, climate change, wage theft, profit theft, labor theft, wealth and income inequality, corporations and monopolies, artificially fixing supply and demand to raise prices and profits (diamond cartel and Amazon), human exploitation and child labor, slavery and imperialism and colonialism where developed western countries took advantage of poor developing countries (Africa and South America). Basically whatever a Socialist could come up with to against Capitalism

For Socialism: equality for all, better education, health, and standards of life, no more wealth and income inequality, wealth and income distribution, the power to the proletariat and to unionize, people either working for themselves or for the greater goods of the people, the people collectively controlling means of production and economy, humans will be living collectively in communal society where they own what they worked for and share among others.

"Marx's Falling rate of profit is worthless drivel I won't resort to pointless rhetoric and meaningless book quotations from marx's. i will cut to the chase and address marx on what he meant by the tendency of profit to fall,which is basically,as competition within and among markets tighten. profit gradually declines because more and more competition is being sorted out from the game.hence,profit is being consolidated by a monopoly/monopsony absorbing all aggregate profit.

Take this example of 3 restaurants competing for consumers.


McMao profit=200$

leninKing profit=210$

Kentucky Fried Stalin=190$

Aggregate profit of the 3 industry=600$

Assuming Kentucky Fried Stalin dominates the market and outperforms the other two leading them insolvent. does that imply Aggregate profit for Kentucky Fried Stalin shrinks for some market reasons such as demand preference(some McMao and LeninKing customers don't like Kentucky Fried Stalin)?No,because in markets,Profit is not a one way,zero sum system.Remember what Leon Walras said about consumers and producers. 

The Producer buys the consumer's money using his product/service,while the consumer buys the producer's product/service using his money. and  vice versa. the consumer sells his money inexchange of the producer's product/service and the producer sells his product/service inexchange of the consumer's money. put simply. in markets,we as individuals are both buyers/sellers and producers/consumers. therefore the prospect of profit to us is inevitable whether whe are producers or consumers. Kentucky Fried stalin's profit as producer might decline due to market uncertainties but Kentucky fried stalin's cheaper products will mean more profit for consumers who are producers too.

Another is the prospecr of emerging competition. Kentucky Fried stalin may gain the monopoly status but we know supply creates its own demand which breeds competition. so it wont take that long when Kentucky Fried Stalin gains new competitions,if not. they have the luxury to increase prices without bolstering fixed  and variable costs because monopolies really don't have problem increasing or decreasing wages for they are the sole buyer of labor in that certain industry.

To conclude, it's true that profit has its tendencies to fall. but that's only half truth. because in capitalist markets.profits and losses are not mutually exclusive. one's loss is another's profit. its not a zero sum game.",Conservative

"The inefficiency of the state and the failure of public company The state dont know jack shit about how to effectively run an economy. Their job in the economy should be protecting the worker's right, safety regulation so people dont die in their job if possible, and environmental protection, and force information transparency to the general public, including wages and price. Hiding wages is anti competition in nature because you dont know that your work is undervalued because you dont know how much others are paid for the same task.

Public company, subsidized firm and bailouts are a source of monopoly. They have unlimited funding, they let people and government pour money into them and then run at deficit for a prolonged period of time to eliminate competition and stimulate demand. 

But once people realize its not giving them any return on investment and stop investing or even pull out from the company and government stop all funding, they will have to catch up with the capital flight to run at profit margin, jacking up price and people stop buying goods and service from them because the price they wanted for it to be worthwhile was when it runs at deficit. As people are leaving, their source of revenue decrease and it eventually collapse and go bankrupt. 

The only way for it to not go bankrupt is if they have finally achieved total monopoly and make it impossible for competition to enter the market and if the goods or service they provided is essential for people to live.

But, on the other hand, I can't stand communists/socialists who will lick the boots of any statist, or will praise dumbasses who did nothing but harm to society, or, believe they're entitled to the world, neither I can stand capitalists who would do anything for profit, even stepping on others or humilliating themselves.

"Private ownership regarding land The core of capitalism if private ownership which allows the accumulation of wealth and the betterment of society via mutual gain. This is the reason why today, we enjoy much more advance luxuries compared to our parents and things are becoming cheaper and cheaper. However, there is one area where that is not happening and that is real estate - land.

Land could be considered a very valuable asset to have and is among the most important capital of all. Land is inherently valuable and could be used for a variety of purposes including creating more capital. It also allows for the building of a shelter - a basic living conditions. A person with land would not need to pay rent which would save them money, the land could be converted to a business location, inherited by children and in most cases, the value of the land, in the long term, will appreciate. 

However, land cannot be created or produced using other material, it is a most definitely finite resource, even more so for lands in advantageous locations. Of course, more land could be ""created"" by creating more cities and towns, however, even this has its limits and is usually extremely difficult and time consuming, especially with regards to nature and the overall environment. On the other hand, population continues to grow exponentially which means those who are born earlier will have an unfair advantage compared to those born later since the value land will almost always appreciate. Under capitalism, land can be inherited and accumulated, later generations who are not born in families with real estate will face great difficulties where there is less real estate to go around. Where im from, almost all land/houses are either inherited or bought with money obtained from selling the real estate they inherited. 

So i would like to ask your opinion on the matter, is this really the case or am i missing anything? is it a bad thing? is there anything we can do or should do?

"The idea of a UBI is stupid and unworkable There are many people who promote the idea of a **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** and I do not understand how these people think it would work financially. I'm Australian, so I will use an Australian example, with $ being AU.

In Australia, the total population is around 25 million, and 80% of those are 15+ (those who would recieve a UBI). That makes a total number of UBI recipients being 20 million people.

Now, the federal government of Australia currently takes in (in 2019-20 fy) [$469.4bn](https://budget.gov.au/2021-22/content/bp1/download/bp1_bs5.pdf), and spends about [$225bn](https://budget.gov.au/2021-22/content/bp1/download/bp1_bs6.pdf) on social security and welfare. That $225bn of social welfare equates to about $11,250 per Australian 15+ spent on social welfare annually (225bn/20m). This is not equally distributed, of course, as not everyone receives social welfare.

Now, the people who support a UBI want it to be at least above the poverty lin. According to the [Melbourne Institute](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/3889393/Poverty-Lines-Australia-March-2021.pdf), the poverty line for a couple +2 kids is $1090 per week. This equates to $56,680 annually per couple, or **$28,340 annually per adult 15+** (28,340\*20m).

If we assume that the UBI is set just at this poverty line, social security levels in Australia would increase to **$566.8bn annually**, **$341bn more** than what the government already pays in social security and more than entire government income is currently.

Now, what some people who support the UBI say is that companies would be required to pay more tax, or workers who earn an income would be required to pay more tax. Both of these arguments are filled with folly.

* **Require companies to pay more tax.** I will be the first to admit that I believe companies should be paying more tax - 30% of Australian companies paid no income tax last year. However, companies paid $84bn in tax in 2020-21. If you expect companies to pay double their income tax, assuming no other fallout from international tax dodging, you would only receive another $84bn in tax revenue - far short of the $341bn requirement.
* **Requiring workers to pay more in tax**. The idea behind this is that is everyone receives $28,340 per year, then the amount of tax paid on their salary should increase. The problem with this is that it disincentives work. Currently the Australian federal government receives $217bn in personal income tax. If we require an additional $341bn from each worker ([13 million workers in Australia](https://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/GainInsights/IndustryInformation)), that would require an **additional $26,230 in taxation per worker**. That means that each worker would only receive, on average, a benefit of $2,100 per year after the UBI was in effect. Additionally, though, you would have a *disincentive* to work. As you are already receiving $28,340 per year, the financial benefits of working are reduced by that level. It makes work less attractive and would ultimately reduce productivity in the economy. It would also have a negative impact on poverty in the long-run, because you would have generations of people entrenched in the idea of 'having just enough to survive' but having no desire to go beyond watching Netflix or YouTube all day, but they will still be relying on the services provided by the people who do want to benefit themselves and society - it is just that these groups will not be subsidising the people who are not working.

This brings up a point which is very important - **work is good**. If you go to /antiwork or many other subs, you get the impression that work is inherently bad. However, work is required for an economy and society to function, and the relationships between different types of jobs are very important. Everything we own, use and rely on is a result of the work of others. Should people be fairly compensated? Absolutely, and I personally support the idea of strengthening anti-slavery laws for international trade. However, some jobs are not designed, or supposed to be, careers. Ideally, you shouldn't be working at McDonald's as a cook whilst trying to support your family, nor should you be trying to support a family as a checkout operator at a supermarket. I do not mean to demean these jobs - I really do not, I spent years working like this. I am meaning to say, though, that the skills required for these jobs are lower than other jobs. 

The skills required to become a doctor or dentist are more than a checkout operator. However, everything is relative. If you double the salary of a checkout operator, then this causes these more required jobs to be less attractive. As a result, less people will spend the years training to do these higher-skilled jobs, and you will have a shortage which will eventually push up costs. This will then result in a new equilibrium, with everything just being more expensive.

As a way to finish my rambling, and to link back to the UBI, I think that people who promote the idea of a UBI do not have an understanding of how the economy works. They do not understand the relationship between income and motivation, and the requirement of having some level of inequality. I think they overestimate the 'intrinsic' motivation that people have and underestimate the motivation of 'need' - many people would be happy to live their lives off the money provided by others only to have their minimum needs met - and this would have a negative impact on both society and the economy at large.",Conservative

"Minimum wage goes up what about those in the work Field already? So minimum wage goes up that’s great… but than everything else goes up… what about people who had to work hard and get promoted to make the $24 an hr they make now. Shouldn’t they get a pay raise of $5 to account for the minimum wage/inflation  going up?

I haven’t heard anyone bring this up (at least I haven’t seen this brought up. Please place links below if you have) 

I just think it’s unfair. Personally, I’ve worked hard to get to where I am and now the teen who flips burger makes $15 an hr? Not trying to be mean but certain job positions should be making so much… entry level people get paid less because companies have to invest in training them as newcomers to the workforce… I know some don’t like to here this but feelings aren’t facts guys! You can’t live in this la la land where you make big bucks for minimum effort… you’re crashing America with that mindset.

Edit to add more context: 

I understand that this post is a bit whiny towards the end to a lot of people SOOOO 

To clarify I’m looking for the viewpoint on minimum wage being so high and how are you feel it’s affecting the cost of living. ( or if it’s even affecting the cost of living at all) 

I feel that corporations aren’t giving high enough raises to people already in the workforce Who worked their way up the ladder for their dollar to account for pricing going up at the rate that it is due to minimum wage having drastically gone up. 

I understand that a lot of you want the idea of everyone living in this nation where no one is hungry and starving. I’m not saying I want people to starve. 

I’m saying minimum wage was never meant to be a livable wage it’s an entry-level wage. For example you’re a youngster usually a minor in your entering the workforce for the 1st time. Maybe your college student. Your wage was never meant to stain a family. It was meant to help you gain the experience to apply for better jobs in the future. 
Companies have to train people who like experience and they invest into those people. These people make mistakes for example if they’re handling money they short drawers on change accidentally. ( Of course companies take this happening into account) 

I think there’s a better solution for providing generational wealth for future generations. Like educating highschoolers better so they’re better prepared to enter the work field. Explaining to them how to get an education for less how to apply for scholarships how to write resumes. How to properly ask for raises and make valid points as to why they deserve those raises  based on job performance and being able to bring facts that prove their job performance is worthy of that extra raise they are asking for. 

I feel that raising minimum wage the way they are doing is not the solution long-term for having less people in poverty. Educating people is a solution for that. 

Guys look at California their minimum wage has always been higher than other states and it’s literally the most expensive state to live in. The minimum wage there is not livable. What makes you think that raising the minimum wage in other states isn’t going to cause the same problem that California is facing? 

These are the things that I would love to hear people in the comments bring up on. I chose this about it specifically because people here will have a different viewpoints on mine and I don’t want to be an echo chamber.  I’m not looking to argue that I am right and all of you are wrong i’m looking for someone to challenge my viewpoint hard enough that I doubt it. 

I hope this edit helps future commentors.

"Anarchy and Hierarchy Generally anarchocapitalism is taken to be ""Anarcho"" in that it is in opposition to a State, however, anarchy itself generally is taken to refer to an opposition of hierarchies.

Further, anarchocapitalism generally allows for slavery (depending on the specific system), doesn't slavery represent the creation of an explicit but otherwise unnecessary hierarchy?

Further, what of the creation of class hierarchies?

Wouldn't practices such as indentured serfitude (pun?) not only result in such hiérarchies, but potentially lead to defacto ""monarchic"" states, thus leading to Feudalism and negating the abolition of the state?",Conservative

"Thought I would share some research on capitalism I came across. Short version: All democracies have been capitalism but not all capitalism = democracies First I will quote the punchline which is the conclusion.  The paper is linked after the quote.  Then the following quote has a basic breakdown of countries and different types of capitalism.  I think it's a really good read, but ymmv.

> Our theoretical and empirical analysis detects clear and distinct tension between capitalism and democracy. It is apparent that capitalism can prosper under both democratic and authoritarian regimes but that so far, democracy has existed only with capitalism. Nevertheless, capitalism and democracy are guided by different principles that create tensions between the two. This is expressed primarily in the different relations to equality and inequality… (p. 15).  https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/mobilized_contention/files/merkel_-_is_capitalism_compatible_with_democracy.pdf


About the 3rd paragraph in the intro of the quoted research article (below) I linked breaks up the number of countries with democracy to authoritarian (e.g., Singapore).  It’s less than  50% with their standard of democracy.

>The success of democracy in the last quarter of the twentieth century was impressive. However, democracy’s success pales in comparison to the spread of capitalism throughout the world. If we take the minimal standards of democracy as a measurement, there were 123 countries (out of around 200) that could be called an “electoral democracy” in 2010 (Freedom House 2010). If the much more stringent concept of a liberal democracy is applied, only 60 countries can be classified as liberal rule of law-based democracies (Merkel 2010). Yet, both electoral and liberal democracies coexist with capitalist economies. Historical evidence also confirms that no developed democracy could exist without capitalism. Vice versa this is not the case. National Socialist Germany, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore and the capitalist dictatorships of Latin America or Asia in the twentieth century all exemplify that capitalism can coexist or even flourish in the context of different forms of political government, such as democracy and dictatorship.",Conservative

3) Putting theories of snapped fingers to create the perfect economy aside, what legitimate moves do you think the US should make to free the market? How do you believe the market can be freed without allowing large capital holders to fill a vacuum of a deregulated society?

"Does this sub support unions and workers' strikes? Capitalism and liberalism are based on:

* **Voluntary** exchange of goods and services
* Freedom of association
* Incentives for the owners of capital to maximize the value of their capital

Since trade under capitalism is supposed to be voluntary, workers have every right not to render their services to a buyer who isn't offering them the wage they want. Much like how Joe the contractor isn't obligated to work for you if you can't agree on a quote, individual workers don't have to work for Kellogs or McDonalds if the company is offering a shit salary. That's why I don't understand it when rightists cry about strikes. If the people selling their labour aren't satisfied with the price they're being offered, they have every right not to work. Kind of like how a grocer isn't obligated to sell to a customer if the customer isn't willing to pay what the grocer is charging. 

Workers also have freedom of association. This means they can band together to collectively bargain, pool their funds, and represent their interests. Any policy restricting collective bargaining is inherently illiberal and tyrannical.  

Workers own a very important form of capital: their own labour. Ideally, the guy selling you the service should have a say in terms of how much the service will cost. Working people can and should try to maximize the exchange value of their labour. After all, that's what capitalism is all about! Capitalism is about people operating in their rational self interest, and it's in the rational self-interests of workers to negotiate for higher wages. 

Growing labour unrest and the rise of r/antiwork is happening because workers are tired of being underpaid, underinsured, overworked, and treated cruelly by their bosses. I have no problem with workers banding together to demand fairer conditions, health/dental insurance and livable wages.",Conservative

"""Primitive Communism"" is nowhere found in nature Not even primitive people qualify as egalitarian in nature. regard Lions in africa. its much easier for a pride than a single or a couple  to take down a buffalo given its size. hence, a collective(hunter gatherer) proves to be optimum choice for that condition. the same case though doesnt apply for smaller preys such as warthogs or impalas that even a female lion could handle with ease. a pride of lions function as an immediate return system due to their inability to store food. so a bigger prey would require more hungry mouth who would benefit for any excess. lions who settle on smaller groups (a couple or three) on the otherhand are optimum for smaller preys so submission to a bigger collective is not necessary condition.


A. Social Factors
(i) Individual trait similarity
Sex - Grouping patterns of male lions may be influenced by their tendency to form coalitions that cooperate to compete with other coalitions for exclusive access to females (Packer & Pusey 1982). Grouping patterns of female lions is believed to be influenced by the need to protect their young and also maintain a long-term territory (Packer, Scheel & Pusey 1990).
Age - Age specific behaviour can also influence grouping patterns in lions. For example, subadult male lions may disperse from their natal pride and form coalitions with other dispersing subadult males (Van Orsdol 1981).
Reproductive state - In lions, lactating mothers tend to temporarily separate from the rest of the pride to forage and nurse their young (Packer et al. 1990).
B. Ecological Factors
(ii) Prey availability
Prey abundance - According to the prey abundance hypothesis, lions would be predicted to prefer areas of higher prey abundance (Hopcraft, Sinclair & Packer 2005), therefore individual lions may aggregate around these areas of high prey abundance
Prey dispersion - A measure of prey dispersion describes the distance lions have to travel to encounter prey or the effort involved in searching for prey. Lions would be expected to aggregate around areas of clustered prey patches, which are easily accessible (Valeix et al. 2010).
Prey herd size - A larger herd of prey might be considered a richer patch insofar as, all else being equal, it provides an opportunity for more than one lion to make a kill (in the Serengeti lions were observed sometimes to kill multiple prey when several lions attacked a herd and each captured an animal (Schaller 1972, page 251)) and also provides a higher chance of the lions finding a vulnerable individual within the herd. Larger preys herds are therefore expected to support larger lions groups.
Prey body size - A large bodied prey also might be considered a rich patch insofar as, for example, a single eland or giraffe could readily feed several lions, whereas a single gazelle could not. Availability of large prey would therefore promote large lions groups and strengthen group ties.
(iii) Interspecific competition
Hyaena to lion ratio - It is suggested that competition with hyaenas may impact the grouping patterns and social structure of lions (Cooper 1991). To avoid detection and encounters with hyaenas, lions may form smaller prides and also hunt smaller prey, so that they are less conspicuous (Périquet, Fritz & Revilla 2015). It is therefore likely that the ratio of hyaenas to lions may have an effect on lion social structure and grouping patterns.

[Lion Group structuring](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03013358/document)


To distill the point down it's essence. Humans like tigers are by no means generally egalitarian. Humans like sub-adult male lions tend to experience ""donor fatigue"" and leave a collective(hunter gatherer/immediate return system) this is not to mention the fact that individual humans can store food(delayed response system) through a credit system(lending food,belongings) to other member of the tribe inexchange of cooperation or a means of preserving value like how modern currency systems work.",Conservative

"We need something besides the constant refrain to interpret 2A as completely inviolable. So I'm mostly left leaning, and I see a lot of overlap with progressives, but I also see a need to live in reality when it comes to gun ownership and control. The guns are out there, we can't get them all back, criminals will get them while law abiders don't.  I don't like it but it's cold logical. 

However the strict interpretation of 2A is going to backfire, especially as it is so often paired with the ""good guy with a gun"" trope, because when bullets fly people get hurt. 

I just read a story about a 9yo hit with a stray bullet from someone defending themselves - badly as the criminal isn't mentioned as being shot or caught - In Texas.

"Do libertarians tend to conflate socialism with centre-left liberalism and social democracy? The vibe I get from libertarians is that socialism is whenever the government *does stuff.* 

Any form of public healthcare? That's socialism. Environmental regulations and public investment in a green future? That's socialism. A welfare state designed to help poor people survive and lift themselves out of poverty? That's socialism. Minimum wage and labour laws? That's socialism. Subsidies for higher education or student debt relief? That's socialism. Regulations requiring that people wear masks and get vaccinated to stop the spread of COVID-19? That's socialism.

I've never understood this view. It's as if *anything* that involves public programs or positive liberty is branded by libertarians as socialism and a gateway drug to communism and therefore undesirable. I got called a ""commie pinko"" on Quora once for suggesting universal healthcare and I got called a ""communist"" for suggesting that mandatory duties and obligations exist parallel to rights and freedoms. People have called Joe Biden, an explicitly neoliberal politician, a ""communist"". Bernie Sanders, despite being a politician that would be considered a centrist in most other capitalist countries, has of course been called a ""communist"". And Justin Trudeau, a neoliberal who the Canadian left decries as being a neoliberal capitalist shill, has been called a communist.

There seems to be a huge gulf between what libertarians consider socialism and what socialism actually is. 

Socialism is NOT simply taxes, wealth redistribution, and state-administered public services within a capitalistic and free-market framework. That's what most of the capitalist world practices, and that's what the progressive faction of the democratic party wants the U.S to adopt. People like AOC, Bernie Sanders, other Democrats and the America left at large don't want to turn America into the USSR or North Korea, they want to turn it into the UK, Denmark, Germany, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Those countries are pretty awesome in many ways. 

Socialism is a **needs-based economy utilizing** ***collective ownership of the means of production*** **under the auspices of a communist party that exercises one-party rule through Marxist-Leninist democratic centralism.** 

Socialism involves the expropriation of private enterprise, central economic planning, and the use of state-directed markets to create a superabundant society whereby *communism*, a stateless, classless, and moneyless post-scarcity society, can be achieved. Socialism has nothing to do with welfare programs, public school, or wealth redistribution through taxes. It's a radically different way of structuring the economy. 

Ideologies like social democracy, progressive strains of modern liberalism or New Deal style politics aren't even close to being socialist. They are 100% capitalistic ideologies. They accept and embrace the capitalist mode of production, fully recognize the necessity of private enterprise and free markets, and don't believe that wage labour is exploitative. In fact, many of those countries with ""socialist"" policies actually have freer markets than the United States. 

So, why do many libertarians seem to conflate tax-and-spend ™ liberalism and socialism democracy with socialism?",Conservative

"About negligence and prevention Take this example given by Rothbard:

>Suppose, for example, that A builds a building, sells it to B, and it promptly collapses. A should be liable for injuring B's person and property and the liability should be proven in court, which can then enforce the proper measures of restitution and punishment. But if the legislature has imposed building codes and inspections in the name of ""safety,"" innocent builders (that is, those whose buildings have not collapsed) are subjected to unnecessary and often costly rules, with no necessity by government to prove crime or damage. They have committed no tort or crime, but are subject to rules, often only distantly related to safety, in advance by tyrannical governmental bodies. Yet, a builder who meets administrative inspection and safety codes and then has a building of his collapse, is often let off the hook by the courts. After all, has he not obeyed all the safety rules of the government, and hasn't he thereby received the advance imprimatur of the authorities?

Although the concept intuitively makes sense, it doesn't seem to hold when you consider others who are put at risk by negligence. For instance, B might have willingly and knowingly accepted to live in A's irresponsibly built building, however the building might collapse in C's house. Of course a building may collapse even with safety regulations in place, and the cause must be determined and proper action taken. It is also clear that the building might stay intact even with no regulations in place. Nevertheless, it is far more likely to collapse when regulations are violated, and given enough negligence it is bound to happen. What's to protect C from A's aggression if no measures are taken to prevent it? Isn't the negligence in itself an aggression? ",Conservative

With that being said I do think he set some good precedents in regards to the presidency such as the two-term limit and the cabinet system and I think we would arguably be worse off if those precedents were not set. He also had the option to make the presidency even more authoritarian than it is currently and I'm very thankful that he didn't.

"Is a one world government the only way to end war and tyranny? This is not bait. Just consider this for a moment. First, ask yourself what libertarian government is. To me it means ruling by consent rather than by coercion; meaning that a government is obeyed because its citizens recognize it as legitimate. If some citizens no longer consent to the government's rule, they can either try to change the way it is run, or they can leave. Leaving could mean either moving or seceding to another jurisdiction. In essence, self-determination. A truly libertarian state can only be one which allows self-determination within its own borders.

Consider the current situation in Ukraine. It originates from 2014 when some people who did not consent to the rule of the Ukrainian government attempted to overthrow it. However there were others, notably in the eastern provinces, who did not wish to be under the new government. This resulted in at least some genuine desire for secession, which Russia used as a pretext for its occupation of Crimea and now full-blown war.

However Russia is not the only state being tyrannical, although arguably much more more so. The Ukrainian government was reluctant to allow Crimea and Donbas to secede. If a fair referendum were conducted and Crimea, Donbas or any other region decided to secede, it would be tyrannical to force them to stay under the Ukrainian government. There was also the proposal to vote on making Ukraine a federation, which was ignored. If that had happened, perhaps the secessionist movements would've dissipated.

Of course the real problem is the monopoly on violence. After Russia occupied Crimea, there was a referendum, but who knows what the real results were. It didn't matter, because Russia occupies Crimea by force and therefore will retain its rule. The same can be said of regions within Ukraine which wish to join Russia or become independent. We don't even know which regions these are, as there isn't a neutral government to oversee and enforce fair referendums. This whole thing, as with most wars, is merely deciding which tyrannical state gets to force which areas into submission.

I think the only way to avoid this is to have a one world government with an absolute monopoly on violence, but which only uses force to ensure that self-determination is upheld. Something like the UN, but instead of drafting worthless ""international law"", it could actually stop (or preferably prevent) aggression like what is going on in Ukraine, and ensure that a democratic process of determining statehood takes place in each region. How to actually accomplish such a government without it becoming tyrannical itself is another thing. But does this make sense to anyone else, or do you think there's another way?",Conservative

"How will health care work in a Anarcho Capitalist society? Here's my question, by the way this is my first post in Reddit as a whole I believe.

How will health care work, given the inflation on the free market due to write-offs from the hospital? Hospitals everyday take in whoever they see sick in their emergency rooms. It is my understanding that if you are having a heart attack, they will treat you first, and ask about your insurance later. 

So, when a person comes in who is having a heart attack, has no insurance, and no job, he gets treated for his heart attack and lives to tell about it. He leaves the hospital with a $100,000 bill that he never intends on paying, and the hospital eventually realizes this. They write it off, because they know they can try to send him to collections, but more than likely, that money will never be seen.

How do you have a free market, where this sort of thing is bound to happen. The hospitals inevitably shift the loss of profit to insurance holding patients, thus rising the cost of medical care overall. How do we fix this problem? ",Conservative

"The hard truth is that if Republicans won’t stand up to Trump, they can’t stand up to Putin or Xi. Much has been said about the assault on American democracy by a radicalized Republican Party, but its international consequences have not gotten the attention they deserve. 
Republican leaders are abandoning core tenets of American democracy even as the stakes in the global contest between democracy and autocracy are clearer and higher than at any time since the end of the Cold War.              They are defending coup-plotters and curbing voting rights while Russia tries to crush Ukraine’s fragile democracy and China menaces not only Taiwan but democracies everywhere, from Australia to Lithuania.

The scope of that wider struggle was on vivid display on February 4.       In Beijing, the world’s two most powerful autocrats—Putin and China’s Xi Jinping—cemented their deepening alliance.          In the United States, where American leaders should have been unified in championing democracy against these aggressive adversaries, the opposite happened:        The Republican National Committee formally declared the violent insurrection of January 6, 2021, to be     “legitimate political discourse.”

It was dismaying but not surprising that Trump praised Putin’s move to recognize and occupy separatist enclaves in Ukraine as “genius” and “savvy.”       But even Republican leaders who still take a Reaganesque view of America’s role in the world and talk a good game about deterring Russia and competing with China are undercutting those goals by   aiding and abetting Trump’s attacks on America’s democratic institutions.

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri rails often against China and has said the United States should “lead the free world” to confront a Chinese Communist Party that is “a menace to all free peoples.”           Yet Hawley led the effort in Congress to overturn the 2020 election, and the image of his raised fist saluting insurrectionists on January 6 is an indelible memory of that dark day for American democracy.

"Serious question for everyone. Are all Protests equal? Im truly interested and hope this gets civil debate/discussion 

Are all protests equal?

There is a lot of discussion, argument and anger over the Canadian trucker protests. Many on here are being called “bootlicker” for not supporting the protests and many are trying to compare them to the civil rights marches of Dr King. One person is even said this was a more justified protest than BLM because black people were killed by cops that often (or something along those lines)!

Others are saying they are protesting in bad faith or something very minor and not worthy of shutting down entire areas, businesses, etc. 

I will say I see the people saying this is equal to the civil rights protests are the same people that wanted Colin Kapernick fired for kneeling, Cheering or justifying the teargas,rubber bullets, and police brutality of the BLM protests (not the riots the protests) and supported the bills passed to run over protesters in the streets. 

To be fair I also saw some BLM supporters wanting these guys tear-gassed and shot with rubber bullets. (Be better than them. Point of the hypocrisy don’t engage in it) 

IMHO this was not justified and neither was Chaz. BLM protests were legit as would be these guys driving in on Friday, airing the grievances on Saturday/honking their horns/flying their (non racist) flags and banners and then going home Saturday night. 


Would this type (full blocking of an entire city/border bridge/roadway and causing huge safety issues and loud noises all thorough the night for several days) of behavior/blockades be acceptable for:

Seatbelt mandates?

Mask mandates? 

Dui laws?

Smoking cigarettes/tobacco laws?

Speed limits? 

Children vaccination schedule for going to school?

Nudity laws?

“Now shoes no shirt no service” laws 


Where is the line? Freedom of speech and right to protest are not absolute.

For some context and based on my understanding the main reason for the protests was the mandate that truckers had to be vaccinated and the vaccine mandate was for crossing into the US and wasn’t required if your didn’t cross the US/CA border. 

So even if Canada lifted it the truckers still couldn’t cross the border into the US without being vaccinated or quarantining for 2 weeks. 


This brings in the question of the protests. Do you think anyone should be able to cross international borders without following another countries rules? Shouldn’t a country be able to dictate health status of non citizens entering?

If we give the same weight to all protests would anything move again? If vegans know they could do this without being removed by the government they’d absolutely block highways that transport meat and business that serve it.

How about if huge groups of abortion protesters did this? Gun grabbers? Gun nuts? 

Relevant meme https://i.imgur.com/SyLPzal.jpg


Another point/question, maybe be another tome, does the organizers of the protest matter? One of the main organizers for this protest was a openly and proud racist, white nationalist and borderline neo Nazi. Another was a Christian sharia law, rule the world according to the Bible moron. Another was part of the Canadian political party that wanted to make all the Canadian leaders resign and put their own selected leaders in power, basically a dictatorship.

I support lots of causes but if I got an email
About a big “insert cause here” protest that I was all excited about and then found out the leaders/organizers where a new black panther kill all white people guy, a Muslim cleric who wanted to have sharia rule the country and Nickleback fan club president id nope the fuck out no matter how important the cause.

"Dismantling Das Kaptal, Day 1 Pt. 2 In the interest of full integrity and disclosure, I am relying on the Penguin Books edition published in 1990 as part of the ""Penguin Classics""  reprint.   


Before the source text there is a series of prefaces, including a bizarre one by Ernest Mandel.    
I'm not here about Mandel's literature, so I'm not going into it spare to say it's valuable for perspective on context of when *Capital* was written, as well as the lines of thought that might have influenced Marx's work. It also reads a little like he's Flavor Flav coming on stage to hype the crowd up for...well...Public Enemy.   
There area actually several letters and prefaces that serve to whip the reader up before taking on Capitol which, I think, is a little telling. I can't think of another text I've read that needed seven or eight people to say how important the text is, and why it's so meaningful.  


I will say the most important preface regards the translation. In sum, it explains that the book isn't just a guess German, or a coarse google translate- and that qualified scholars have generally agreed and given their ""blessing"" to this translation.   


Now, finally, onto Capital.  
Chapter 1: The Commodity   
I. The Two Factors of The Commodity: Use-Value and Value (substance of value, magnitude of value).  
I suspect a careless reading of this section is what inspires many bright-eyed communists.   
Marx unpacks that all things have a use value, and a magnitude of value.   
He says, for example, that wheat can be exchanged for boot polish, gold, and so on.  
While white, polish, and gold have their respective use-value of ""1"" - the resources are not fungible.   
Marx goes on to say that because we can trade these goods in different quantities and still maintain the use-value, there must be some commonality among all goods. There must, he states, be some non-physical property about these things that can convert them into a use-value.   
He adds to the mystery he is fabricating:   
""1o0 PoUndS wOrtH of lEAd or iRon is of as GrEaT a VaLUe as oNe HunDrEd PoUndS wOrTH of sIlvER aNd gOlD.""   
He follows up, disingenuously, that this is preposterous, and says ""If then we disregard the use-value of commodities only one property remains, that of being products of labor.""   
Then he goes on to basically say everything is a giant, heaping pile of labor. Marx suggests that all of that labor is fungible. An hour spinning a loom, an hour mining coal, or an hour picking vegetables? All the same. Of course this does not address the comrade who spent his hour catching flies. So Marx qualifies that labor value must include social value. Comrade fly catcher is not contributing because nobody can *use* comrade fly catcher's flies.   
That's the end of Chapter 1, Part 1. \*Record Scratch\* Now let's come back to reality.  
Some of you likely started chuckling when you read Marx's pseudo-conundrum about how we could *possibly* make an exchange between two different items.   
Help me out, Reddit. Is there some medium of exchange out there where, like, I can accept that medium for the wheat I produced and give it to Mary for the boot polish she has? Like, I  thrashed 3 bushels of wheat today and I don't even need one. Mary has enough polish for 20 boots but her family has 5 pairs. But Mary doesn't need wheat either. Could we just, like, let a different medium stand in for value and trade that for goods and services?   


Ohhhh yeah. Fiat. Fiat money was the word we're looking for.     


Now, let's go back to this fungible labor thing. Marx has either sneakily or carelessly written skill out of the formula.   
Let's suppose that, aside from Comrade fly catcher's penchant for catching flies on the clock, he also happens to be an excellent blacksmith. Everything he makes is superb.   
There is another blacksmith, comrade Everyman in town. He's good, and meets the average output needed to have social value, but his wares fall apart long before Comrade fly catcher's.    
In Marx's estimation, an hour of comrade everyman's time is just as valuable and socially useful as comrade fly catcher's time.   
Even in a vacuum where things like profit motive and competition aren't accounted for, society is losing in Marx's Philosophy because it accepts inferior and superior output as equal.

Do you think other countries see biden as an easy target to deal with as he's clearly been mentally deteriorating since before he was even elected?
And do you think they were waiting for trump to get out of office before invading and pushing into other countries because trump was a wild card who might have just started lobbing nukes? (Also referring to china potentially invading Taiwan soon)

"The Value Amazon brings according to Bezos  **Create More Than You Consume**

 If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out. Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020. 

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion. 

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion. For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers. We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time. 

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century. So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventyfive hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation. 

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020. Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion. 

Summarizing: Shareholders $21B Employees $91B 3P Sellers $25B Customers $164B Total $301B 

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation. Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting. 

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too. Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success. If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule. We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching. Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

"Perspective on government controlled housing market Lots of people on reddit seem to vilify landlords as evil parasites. Anti-landlord argument is that they just collect rent, and taking advantage of poor renters. Pro-landlord arguments are that they are providing important service and absorbing risk. No one seems to know or discuss the alternatives. Remembering soviet Russia perhaps I can describe the Russian system during socialism/communism.

In Soviet system they tried to allocate housing fairly and since property ownership was illegal, all property was owned by the state and ""rented out"" to the people. However housing is inherintely unequal resource. Some is closer to city center, some is smaller some is larger, some is newer and some is older. The fist thing that soviets did, was build massive apartment complexes. They were gigantic, hideous, cheap to build and every unit was state approved size (maybe  500 sqft  on average).   So, since housing was guaranteed, you were given one ""fairly"" so you did not actually get to choose where you live.


You get assigned an apartment, that information goes into your papers. These papers now determine where you live and you CANNOT physically change it without petitioning the government.  You are likely live there for the rest of your life. At any point the government may decide to give you a new address and you will now live in new address. If you protest you may end up in jail or Siberia since you are considered an anti communist.

At any point the government may decide that 500 sq ft is too large for a family of 4 people, they may move in another family (or 7) without your input.

The city where you live is written into your passport, moving between cities is illegal and is akin to immigrating into a completely different country.

The government is your landlord, so if anything breaks you need to petition the government to fix it. It may take a while. Nothing ever gets repaired or improved.

This system is considered ""fair"" and if you would like to live in this kind of system let me know.

TL:DR: Without private landlords your DMV is your landlord. You may not move out.",Conservative

"By making products illegal the state serves to only make them more desirable to rebellious people I would argue that you can see an example of this with tobacco and marijuana. Marijuana still is arguably the more prohibited of the two but it's trend over the past decade has generally been one of legalization. Compare this to tobacco which has seen increasingly more regulation; the smoking age in the US has gone up and New Zealand has banned tobacco for those born after a certain date in an effort to create a ""tobacco free generation"". I think the trend that we will see is that tobacco and marijuana will switch places, in the past it was that rebellious people used marijuana and more mainstream people used tobacco but with the way things are trending I think you will start to see the more rebellious people using tobacco and the more mainstream people using marijuana.

"Why Bill Gates will not allow his daughter to marry a poor person. ""A few months ago there was a conference in the United States on investment and finance. One of the speakers was Bill Gates and during the question and answer session, he was asked a question that had everyone laughing.

If he, the richest man in the world, could accept that his daughter marries a poor or modest man.

His answer can change something in everyone.

***Bill*** \- *First of all, understand that Wealth does not mean having a fat bank account.* ***Wealth is primarily the ability to create wealth.***

*Example: Someone who wins the lottery or gambling. Even if he wins 100 million is not a rich man: He is a poor man with a lot of money. That's the reason why 90% of the lottery millionaires become poor again after 5 years.*

*You also have rich people who have no money.*

*Example: Most entrepreneurs.*

*THEY are already on the road to wealth even though they have no money because they are developing their financial intelligence and that is wealth.*

*How are the rich and the poor different?*

*If you see a young person who decides to train, to learn new things, who tries to improve himself constantly, know that he is a rich man.*

*If you see a young person who thinks that the problem is the state, and who thinks that the rich are all thieves and who criticizes constantly, know that he is a poor man.*

*The rich are convinced that they just need information and training to take off, the poor thing that others must give them money to take off.*

*In conclusion, when I say that my daughter will not marry a poor man, I am not talking about money. I'm talking about the ability to create wealth in that man.*

*Excuse me for saying this, but most criminals are poor people. When they are in front of money, they lose their mind, that's why they rob, steal, etc... For them, it is grace because they don't know how they could earn money by themselves.*

*One day, the guard of a bank found a bag full of money, he took the bag and went to give it to the bank manager.*

*People called this man an idiot, but in reality, this man was just a rich man who had no money.*

*One year later, the bank offered him a job as a receptionist, 3 years later he was a customer manager and 10 years later he manages the regional management of this bank, he manages hundreds of employees and his annual bonus exceeds the amount he could have stolen.*

"Welfare Policies Incentivise Racism Welfare policies inherently promote racism in a country.   
They cause people inside a country to hate immigrants coming into a country and taking away ""their group's"" resources  
Giving welfare to one group causes other groups to resent that group.  
Austerity causes all groups to blame each other for taking or not sharing enough the country's resources.   
Government regulations like minimum wages cause minorities and immigrants to be locked out of lock-skilled jobs - often intentionally.   
Red lining caused some groups to get government assistence for buying homes while excluding others.  
In the UK, EU citizen's free access to healthcare within the UK was a contributing factor in the UK leaving the EU.  
Welfare policies are often the root cause of racial discrimination between groups and raise racial awareness and segregation.

"Making heads or tails of current gerrymandering results? Politico and FiveThirtyEight both have really nice looking trackers on their sites to cover the latest results of redistricting across the states. The trouble is, while both of them seem to have current maps, both sites have drawn exactly opposite conclusions currently regarding who is ""winning"" and who is ""losing"" (aside from all Americans who truly believe in representative democracy who are the real losers in this case, regardless of political leaning).

Politico shows a net loss of 19 competitive districts with the GOP gaining 12 and the Dems gaining 7, respectively. FiveThirtyEight shows a net loss of 8 competitive districts with the GOP *losing* 3 and the Dems gaining 11, respectively. Thus the former site currently shows the GOP as overall gaining from gerrymandering and the latter site shows the Dems as overall gaining.

Both sites have the same left-center bias with high factual reporting according to media bias fact check, so I imagine the discrepancy comes from how they're actually tallying what a ""competitive"" versus a partisan district is. FiveThirtyEight shows details on their calculations while Politico is a bit more nebulous, but they both say they take demographics (notably racial makeup and college degrees) heavily into account.

Can anyone chime in on this? I'm just trying to wrap my head around all the craziness but I can't actually tell right now how much of a difference for each party the current maps have made.

"Beyond capitalism I'm not sure capitalism is the best thing ever, but it seems to work better for our society today than any known alternative. (I started to write this in reply to another post, but felt it spun into its own post.)

Money is a crude tool. It distills everything down to one number. This can produce weird results. For example you can buy a small business that employs several people for the same price as a small house in the Bay Area. 

Maybe we should have different currencies for shelter or other items? Productive assets compete with dead money. Our over-investment in housing stock, especially at the higher end, lowers our national income. I realize this is a choice made by the purchaser, but certain incentives kick in at the individual level that are at odds with broader society. (Full disclosure - I spend a lot more on shelter than I probably should.)

Many video games, for example, have multiple ""currencies"" which are used in game to allocate different categories of goods. This only works because there can be no black market that allows for arbitrage.

As we approach the singularity and post scarcity for many goods (but few services) capitalism will likely face existential challenges. We should prepare. 

In ""primitive"" societies, ""money"" was used to allocate only certain items that were scarce and used daily. Fish, rice, tools, but things like housing and livestock were allocated based on status. This continues to some effect today to a lesser degree in some modern societies. (A great book that touches on this is ""A History of Money: From Ancient Times to the Present Day,"" by Glyn Davies.)

When people compare CEO pay in the U.S. to other countries (e.g., Japan) or even America in the 1960s, they're missing this element. Becoming a CEO used to be a grooming process and included many perquisites and intangible benefits rather than a straight bidding war. I accept that the transparency and broadened net resulting from the bidding war likely produce greater economic efficiency, but it is a bit cringe when CEOs are making unfathomable sums while others toil for a year to make what the CEO nets in an hour.

How does one value art? Many artists struggle with this. I think a lot of them would rather see the piece go to a ""good home"" ... where somebody they like appreciates it, than net top dollar. And don't even get me started on how puppies are sold! Seems so odd ... I wouldn't sell my six year old mutt for a million dollars, but you can buy a puppy for $500.

I watch movies and television shows set in the future, and most gloss over the role of money (think your Star Trek series, etc.). The movie ""In Time"" was not a great movie, but a great exploration of an alternative currency.

As technology advances and blockchain becomes more ubiquitous, money might be divided into different use categories that embed different tax rates or scarcity based on societal values. This would obviously be a restriction on freedom in some sense. While I value freedom above almost everything, we have responsibilities to society (hedonism has its limits) and our current system is very lumpy and destined to get lumpier as we approach post-scarcity for many goods.",Conservative

"Thoughts on the Difficulty of a Libertarian movement in the US This is a follow up to a comment I made on a post about property rights.

Consider for a moment why we have rights.

Rights seem self evident, they seem to justify themselves, there is no need for religious or moral arguments for things like free speech, freedom of the press, due process of law etc. but why do we have these things?

The answer is that we have rights, and a need to exercise them when we do things that others do not want us to do.

Who exercises free speech? We all do, but we only discuss the **right** to freedom of speech when people say contentious things about large groups of people who get mad about it. Consider the Westboro Baptist Church, they are almost always mentioned in Free Speech discussions, and why? They do things which a lot of people disagree with (admittedly, many do agree with them).

In terms of property for example, if a libertarian party advocated for stronger individual property rights, that is quite agreeable.

But consider on a local scale, some neighbors advocating for increased property rights would likely come at the detriment of some other person in that neighborhood. One  person saying ""I want the right to start a business at my home without government intervention"" and that persons neighbor might say ""I want to live in a neighborhood which is free from the busyness which a business brings"".

Both of these people would like their individual rights recognized and vindicated, yet if either person got their rights vindicated, it would come at the detriment of the other.

So a libertarian advocating for more property rights in general gets into a bit of a pickle, who's rights are better? Do we just ask the entire neighborhood? What of the neighbor who does not get their way, they have been deprived of something they desire simply due to his local majority opinion, and perhaps that is how democracy is supposed to work.

I do quite like this sub, I think we have great discussions here and I believe that we all have each others interests in mind, regardless of your tilt to the ""left"" or ""right"", but I have come to a conclusion that if we want to create a movement with a focus on individual liberty, we must prioritize something beyond just vindicating individual rights and the free market. I do not know what that thing is, or should be, and perhaps the idea of a focused, institutional goal is against what some believe libertarianism is all about.  I invite suggestions and other thoughts. I just feel that in today's society, solutions to our problems are not as always as simple as shortening the arms government. Though, if somebody can suggest otherwise I would be happy to hear",Conservative

"Increasing the Wealth Tax in the US I'm broadly sympathetic to capitalism but don't receive engaging challenges to what I believe is a just society. Hopefully others can help me out here.

It's not clear to me that increasing taxes on the wealthy will improve government nor society. 

Isn't it **better that the wealthy invest** in companies and nonprofits that compete vs a guaranteed cash flow to government?
If the wealthiest are taxed more as a percentage, what then?

Best case scenario: 
This redistribution of funds goes to support a certain societal safety net. And those who are middle income are taxed less so they can support their local economy and save/invest in their future.

Granting this best case scenario:
Would this be counterfactually worse than if the wealthiest invested in these communities? 
But I'm not certain that the increased tax dollars will actually go to help those in need.

Socialists (generally speaking) don't want to see past the hypothetical. They like the first order effects because that feels good.
However, I'm not certain that giving the government more power (via increased funding and programs) will actually help. Governments are corporations, too.

How would increased tax dollars impact the government? What about the organizations the ultra wealthy support?

"Here is a video which shows how most people are typical statist who don't even hesitate to vote in favor of new taxes and new rules. The video link at the bottom is about Mark Dice asking random people to sign a petition to support a new white privilege tax on white people. 

Most of the people in the video agreed without even hesitating or giving it a second thought. They just go along with whatever new law or whatever new tax is put in their face. They don't ask basic ass questions like what will the money be for, how much money will be generated. Who will control this money.

This is your Typical left wing statist mentality: ""If some group of people are doing better they need to be brought down through taxation and regulation in order for people to be more equal."" Thats why a lot of progressives believe in high taxes. because some people are making too much and things need to be more ""fair"".

Your typical statist doesn't care that the government uses force through the threat of coercion to take people's money. Your typical statist believes everything the government does is legitimate. And if something is wrong with the government. Well thats just white supremacy and dont worry, putting more people of color and being more woke will fix that shit right away! 

This is why and how the government is able to get away with passing trillion dollar stimulus bills that don't really do anything except make people of special interest richer while making all of us poorer through inflation. This is why the government is able to pass tens of thousands of new laws and regulations every year. Why every year we have a bigger government and a little be less liberty. All while you have Far left Statist screaming that we need more regulations and higher taxes.

This is why democracy is a BS dangerous ideology. If we had global democracy billions of people from the third world would vote for a all powerful totalitarian socialist government to take control of everything and redistribute all wealth and destroy all capitalism. 

This is why democrats in the US are flooding the country with illegals. They know most immigrants will vote for a bigger government that promises more welfare on every election cycle. Plus a poor dumb population that is too busy working long hours is easier to control so it makes sense for them.

"Tales of conglomeratism.......’it’s still capitalism 🤡”..... The middle class was once a symbol of the American dream. It meant financial security and an opportunity for a better future. But that portrait of the American middle class is quite different today.     A survey in 2018 found that a third of middle-income adults don't have as much as $400 to cover an unexpected expense.       And while the middle-class lifestyle grows more expensive and uncertain, it's also moving beyond the reach of younger generations.



                     It's not that the economy got worse,    it was that there were policy decisions made so

I just wanted to know what you guys think about the actions of the other countries assisting Ukraine with military weapons and about this quote. I suppose they are already doing their communication part. Is it better for us not selling/giving weapons to Ukraine? And should we (according to the quote) stop them by **sending troops** to Ukraine, to **protect the area** while we are doing the negotiations. And doing this without harming anything Russian that is outside of the lands of Ukraine (without taking sides nor harming any part).

What do you think about this view of the Chinese Foreign Ministers? This is a question about global politics in comparison with common morals. I think this is worth discussing.

EDIT: Just to clear things up. Both Russia and Ukraine can do what they do, and we as the audience of the fight should go in and stop the fight by dragging on their backs, and NOT by giving them more lethal weapons to fight. This is, according to the analogy.",Conservative

"Culture lasts longer where it is transferred to than in its place of origin. I saw a video recently from SowellTV on YouTube which claimed that culture lasts longer where it is transferred to than in the place where it originates. It gave a few examples like that the American Southerners kept using words spoken in England that were no longer actually used in England where they originated from. This made me think of the migrants that come to the United States from Latin America and vote for the same policies that ruined the country where they came from. I used to think that maybe it was possible do something like educate them somehow or something to stop them from doing this. Or that for whatever reason immigrants would one day stop doing this.  But now I think maybe I was being too naive for thinking that.

"What do libertarians think about governments 'printing' money? So Milton Friedman just won the prestigious libertarian thinker strawpoll on this subreddit so maybe this is a good start: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B_nGEj8wIP0

I've been seeing a ton of Fox News style propoganda against the Canadian government posted here which is odd as I imagine most people here are Americans.  I was wondering whether libertarians show the same outrage towards their governments 'printing' money. With the recent uptick in inflation many people are concerned that this is leading to a permanent reduction in the purchasing power of most people. So say if you could buy a certain amount of trucks and guns or even other things like homes, Christmas presents, vacations, taking your kids out to the ball game etc before the pandemic. You will now be able to buy less of all that over the span of your life. This is  amplifying a heartfelt concern that many people already shared that they won't be able to buy homes and many other goods/services as apparently the cost of living has outpaced wage gains (although I'm sure you could find an economist that argues otherwise).

Do libertarians care that they will be able to buy less guns and trucks over the span of their life because governments 'printed' money to bail out Jeffrey Epstein's friends (i.e. the American elite)? Does this need to be put in left wing and right wing terms for American libertarians to care? Can't fox news blame it on the Democrats so libertarians will care? Can someone here reach out to libertarian organizations like fox news?

"Because definitions of capitalist terms are always approximate, authorities who give definitions should also supply examples When discussing a complex idea with a sympathetic collaborator, one must have clear definitions and unambiguously shared interpretations; otherwise nothing can begin. Unfortunately, the methods that are necessary for discussing complex topics with sympathetic audiences fail when discussing those same topics with hostile audiences.

Debates about complex topics are often unproductive because two or more sets of hostile participants do not share any clear set of definitions and interpretations. Even when the definitions appear to be terse and simple, the participants often interpret the definitions very differently. In the worst case scenario, opportunistic parasites prefer the confusion to any kind of productive debate and resort to emotion-provoking tactics to prevent debate and waste the resources of those who hope to debate.

By contrast, people who start from concrete examples may succeed in provoking unemotional and constructive debate. Example:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/ntmg0a/the_lie_and_myth_of_nordic_socialism_debunked/

The original post of that thread has many flaws and I suspect I would disagree with the author, but at least the examples of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Kerala are clearly presented. If I doubt the author's facts, I can double-check the examples easily enough.   I believe the key point of the original author's discussion takes the form of his definition:

>**Nordic socialism** means deceptive politicians claiming paternity to good developments due to exogenous factors

For general purposes of technical communication, the lesson to be learned is that one must present a large, orderly set of interesting, relevant facts before one can get the audience to seriously consider a controversial definition. For the specific academic purpose of discussions related to capitalism, I am convinced of three lessons:

**Lesson 1**) Some key terms are going to be contentious and the best we can hope for is to chip away on their margins. The author could not hope to get people to agree on what ""socialism"" means but he could at least propose his definition for ""Nordic socialism""-- i.e. the phenomenon that exists when welfare state measures thrive on a foundation of prosperity laid by much older trends of productivity and conscientiousness.

**Lesson 2**) Distinctions between formal governments and state-owned corporations muddy the waters considerably. Example dispute: 

Point:

>Scandinavian governments don't own the means of production whatsoever. They own no factories or farms.

Counterpoint:

>They may not own any means of production but they sure seem to get very high monthly dividends (through company, sales and income taxes), so what's the difference? Either way, you get your share of the profits of the company. The ownership distinction is theoretical.

**Lesson 3**) The Protestant work ethic, or something very much like it, seems to be at the root of the ""classical liberalism"" that started Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Kerala on their respective roads to their current levels of prosperity.

"Marx's theory of Alienation proves how delusional marx was Marx was attacking the notion of specialisation i:e an Engineer vs a construction worker.

Not only he is attacking one's individuality as a means to divorce one from the dictate of a collective. he is also attacking individual success as well.


marx was basically saying that if you know calculus then you're causing alienation because some workers cant do it. or usain bolt alienating fat people who cant compete in olympic sprint.

Just by these examples,you'll realise how deranged marx was.

Capitalism doesn't commodify people. people commodify themselves. if you know anything about the general equillibrium theory. Demand creates its own supply and vice versa. People commence these exchanges to satisfy their demands that coincide or goes commensurately with their supply from the pov of the parties involved.

Marx sought to abolish the division of labour or specialisation in reference to his exploitation theory that concerns surplus. for Marx,specialisation generates surplus and alienates workers from one another by appropriating each individual's niche according to their resoective abilities i:e an engineer who can do modulus of elasticities or structural computations in order to come up with the cheapest yet most durable,less labot intensive materials available in the market that a construction worker couldn't do. this is the case marx wanted to address with the theory of alienation and his solution was to get rid of it. so people can do everything they want irrespective of their innate abilities. in short. a burger flipper can do surgery works or can design 120 storey skyscrapers when jobs are no longer commodities but incentives brought by a post scarcity world where no one have to work for a living. its pure fairy tale that will never occur in reality",Conservative

"Some naive bull I wrote This isn’t going to be some anger-fuelled rant about how the richest 1% of the world has as much as the entire rest of the world combined. That’s capitalism for you, and as much as it’s not fair, it’s what the majority of the West is built on, and it would take far too much restructuring of our entire culture to change quickly enough. No, this is an appeal to those 1% – and really, to anyone with the means necessary – to use what you have wisely. To let money be what saves humanity, rather than what dooms it.

Many of us feel powerless in our lives; powerless to change, powerless to be heard, powerless to make a difference. In our society, money *is* power, and those of us with a mortgage, or rent, or anything that throws doubt on the security of our financial future feel trapped in the grind to dig our way out. Sometimes you spend so long in this grind that you don’t realize you’ve made it out, and you keep grinding away anyway. So, I’m asking you to reflect on what you have. Do you have everything you want? Or more specifically, do you have everything you want *that has a price*?

Go on, make a list. Write down everything that you want – that you really *want* out of life, not just that new DVD player or that nice ring that will replace the equally nice but not quite as novel ring. Now take a look at the list. If you already have everything on that list that can be bought, ask yourself what you need your money for.

I’m willing to bet that one of the most common answers here will be “For a loved one” – maybe for a son or daughter, maybe for a husband or wife – to leave it to them once you’re gone. And I would ask, *why wait?* Why not give it to them now? Perhaps you haven’t given it to them already because you don’t feel like they need it. Sure, if they were penniless, you’d help them out, but they’re stable. They have their own life.

And so, you keep your wealth because you don’t know what else to do with it. Maybe you’re afraid that giving your wealth away and leaving your loved ones with less will make them angry at you, that quiet anger which stews for years. In which case: talk to them, openly and honestly. Language is the great evolutionary advantage we have as humans – well, that and opposable thumbs – so don’t squander it. Use it.

If you’ve reached this point of whatever the heck this is, then maybe you figure you do have wealth to spare. It might not be much; it might be a lot. And now, bearing that in mind, I’ll get to the crux of my argument.

We know the dangers of global warming. (Yes, this was an eco-friendly letter all along, haha!) We know how devastating it will be if it continues, but it will take a tremendous amount of effort to stop it. It would take half the world’s governments to even put a dent in it. And so we feel powerless to stop it.

But, as I mentioned earlier, money *is* power in the West. Use your power. Invest in green energy companies, lobby your government to implement better public transport, fund a scientist’s research into more efficient electronics, build a bunch of solar panels and put them in the Sahara, buy some of the Amazon to protect it from deforestation (@Jeff Bezos, this one has your name written all over it, I mean come on, that’s marketing genius) … although maybe do some research first, because heck knows how feasible any of that is.

I have no doubt that humans will survive whatever apocalypse we create. We may be pests, but we’re bloody persistent. But we could save the whole of humanity, rather than just a few humans, not to mention millions of other species we haven’t even discovered yet. The world is an amazing place, and though it may not be where humanity ends, it is our home. Let’s make sure it stays that way.

Maybe you think this is all naïve garbage and isn’t how the world works. You’re probably right. You may also think that I’m trying to use you for your money, to save the world for me rather than doing anything myself. That’s most definitely true – I don’t have nearly enough money to make a difference on my own. But together, we have the power to make a difference. And that means we have the responsibility.

"I really think AnCap should be called ""Market Anarchism."" **TL:DR The 'capitalism' of today is the 'mercantilism' of yesterday... and [mercantilism](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&ei=dtOYXKviOPLR0PEP3ume0Aw&q=define+mercantism&oq=define+mercantism&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i10l8j0i22i30l2.5157.5699..5747...0.0..0.81.229.3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0.OUaHxQOdGBY) is not anarchist.**

It's less of an oxymoron. I know the capitalists in here are going to disagree, and the AnComs are probably laughing, but let me explain. 

The fundamental beliefs of AnCap can be summarised with the NAP and voluntarism. NAP is the non-aggression principle, for any outsiders. Honestly, I can't see how anyone can have a problem with the NAP, so I'm not going to get into this. Voluntarism, on the other hand, is the voluntary actions among people resulting in self-government and a free-market.

The reason I think we should be rebranded as ""market anarchists"" is because it actually makes more sense from the conventional anarchist's perspective. In fact, our ideology makes much more sense under this name since ""capitalism"" carries a very systemic implication and I do agree it doesn't feel very anarchistic. What non-AnCaps call ""capitalism"" is what ""corporate capitalism"" is to us and as I shitposted about before, it's the system we're currently in. Where the state systemically promotes ""capitalism"" through corporatisation, which protects your personal assets. This takes a lot of the risk out of business, since if Facebook belly-flopped tomorrow, Mr. Zucc would still be a member of high society. Facebook also isn't likely to belly-flop tomorrow though. See how this sounds a lot like mercantilism?

Basically, I'm saying ""capitalism"" is when the government is in the market, therefore, it's no longer free. If it isn't free of the state, then it isn't anarchist. Why do think libertarians love to ramble about getting government ""out of the market?"" [While by literal definition of ""capitalism"" is not a dirty word,](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+capitalism) I'm not going to deny that the word has been bastardised into it's modern crony counterpart. Why do you think corporations are called ""publicly traded companies?"" It's because they're 'public,' in other words, state mandated. (Public schools... Public library... public bus...) Corporations are a result of *laws,* which will let companies act as single entities and protect personal assets. Therefore, corporations are not a result of the market, but of the state. On top of that, it's a form of protectionism for wealth which is something seen in mercantilism, which **is not anarchist.** When the CEO of a corporation makes a dumb corporate decision, **his corporation gets sued. Not him.** Do you understand now? He can face no legal repercussions for what he does as ""Corporation Inc."" The employees usually sign a document which gives up some of that protection. Again, we live under *mercantilism,* where government enacts protectionism. 

Which led me into reading about Anarcho-Mutualism. While I don't see myself as an AnMutualist, it's good to note that Proudhon himself was not against the free-market. He was against systemic capitalism. AnComs at the time even went so far as to distinguish themselves from him because of this, since they saw any market as a form of oppression against the will of the people. Proudhon did not, as you can read in the ""criticisms"" section of the Mutualism Wikipedia page. Proudhon actually seemed to support the market and one AnCom went so far as to call him an ""individualist"" as opposed to a ""collectivist"" like an AnCom is, but he probably also didn't really believe in private property which is where I draw my grey area. As many will happily point out, there's little distinction between ""private"" and ""personal"" property. It's also strange to me that paying rent voluntarily is considered a form of exploitation. It's... voluntary. Conditional does not mean forced. You could also buy property instead. I see where the argument comes from, I just don't see how we could reasonably apply that to the real world as discerning between ""private"" and ""personal"" property becomes more of a grey area the more you question it. Is letting someone use your personal property in exchange for use out of their personal property exploitation? That's an exchange of goods and services. It's a market! ... **But it is not capitalism.**

So that leads me to my conclusion, where we should be rebranded as ""market anarchists."" We believe in voluntarism, the free-market, and the non-aggression principle. Sounds a bit better doesn't it? We're distinguishable from anarcho-mutualists in the fact that we see no distinction between ""personal"" and ""private"" property, but we aren't capitalists because we believe in a market without interference from the state and we believe that individuals can govern themselves through the NAP, the market, and arbitration. That sounds much more anarchist to me. The free-market is at the centre of our ideology, hence the name. I like to think that most anarchists aren't against the NAP or voluntarism, as you'd pretty much be against consent and you would believe in rule of force/aggression at that point. It's also good to note that the NAP is not a law. It's a right governed by the will of the people and their interpretation of the non-aggression principle. Enforcement is enacted through individual disputes in arbitration and violence is only allowed against a violent aggressor. Keep in mind that it's down to **the people's interpretation** of ""violent aggressor."" That idiot who yelled ""FIRE"" in a crowded building? You really think the arbiters and jury will say that didn't break the NAP? Probably not. Everyone could easily argue disturbing the peace is a form of aggression and it would be appropriate for that situation. Laws aren't always appropriate for every situation, this is why [judicial nullification](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+judicial+nullification) exists, and this system has that pro over it. In fact, some people equate judicial nullification to anarchy, since it puts the will of the people above the law, therefore, placing the people above the state. **This is literally about as anarchist as a judicial system can get.**

EDIT: Here's the link to the Wikipedia page. Formatting, the parentheses at the end, is preventing me from linking it with text. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) Ironically, I actually think AnCaps should give AnMutualists a little bit more respect and vice-versa. I find the two to be more related than most think, especially Proudhon. The ""capitalism"" in AnCap obviously scares a lot of them off and as I pointed out, AnCaps have no problem with private property whereas AnMutualists try to make that distinction between ""private"" and ""personal"" property. In fact, it was Proudhon's book *What is Property?* that convinced the young Marx that private property should be abolished. Proudhon criticised it; Marx wanted to abolish it. There's a difference and that is the difference that distinguishes communists from mutualists. Marx actually heavily criticised Proudhon, which is a bit weird considering how buddy-buddy AnMutualists have gotten with AnComs.

> In their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: ""I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction"".

**Proudhon was not a communist,** and he's an anarchist to me even though I don't consider myself AnMutualist.

> As a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected **both capitalism and communism.** He adopted the term mutualism for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers.

Unfortunately with companies being as big as they are and with power corrupting as it does we can't have those anymore. The entrepreneur gets bought out and his inovations sold off with him only seeing a single check. Your mom and pop shop makes a slim profit in the best scenario while businesses offer their goods for cheaper than local shops can afford to.,Conservative

"""freedom"" has become an extreme far right dog whistle  as a core value of libertarian belief, ""freedom"" and ""rights"" - infinitly important yet delicate ideas - have been turned into a dangeous weapon

It is amazing how perfectly phrases are hijacked by the far right and used so precisely and purposley to convey various hateful, racist and often dangerous messages.

covid has given republicans a way to push their extreme ideology just by simply saying they value their freedom. BUT THIS IS NOT NEW REALLY. ""freedom"" has been weaponized by white suprmacists for 150 + years. the southern slave holders were ABLE TO ""JUSTIFY"" slavery because it was their ""right"" and abolishing it would ""infringe on their freedoms""...IM NOT KIDDING. This is well documented.

we all need to open our eyes and see how americans talk about cherishing their ""God given rights and freedom"" because it's always to justify racism, mysogony, having guss, spreading deadly viruses, and spreading vaccine misinformation onnline which has cost untold hundreds of thousands of lives.

"Black Market = Free Market? It seems to me that while a black market may be better than no market, it is clearly not a free market.  But perhaps this point is not so obvious to other people, so I thought it might make a good discussion.  

Suppliers on the black market are clearly trying to support a consumer demand for their product, so there are certainly some market incentives involved.  But as a black market operates illegally under the current regime, this prevents the full range of economic incentives that would exist in an actual free market.  It also prevents legal recourse against black marketeers, both suppliers and consumers.  Criminal activity by black marketeers is thus ""protected"" from legal actions by other black market participants.  Sometimes this leads to reasonable, self-policing, private arbitration efforts, but it also leads to a greater tendency for violent confrontation and retaliation.  

In short, the illegality of the black market exacerbates violent criminal tendencies, thus preventing the full range of economic incentives a free market would provide.  

Black markets are not the same as free markets. ",Conservative

"Russia and Ukraine: Summary History on how we got here – note this is informational and meant to inform the MOTIVATIONS of Russia, this a NOT A DEFENSE OR JUSTIFICATION. As a libertarian, more specifically an An-cap I am completely against this and all wars. That should be enough of a disclaimer however we have reached a post 9/11 level of fervor where any mention of why Russia is doing this is automatically perceived as defending Russian/Putin. I don’t know how much of this is purely organic which I’m sure most of this is, and how much of this is both organic but also fueled by bots and war propaganda as after people took notice of reddits ‘power’ in 2015-2016 this site has long been compromised.

However I did want to review the History of this so people have a better understanding as to why. Most people have made the claim ‘Putin wants to re-create the USSR all of eastern Europe is next’ this is not true whatsoever and on the level of “they hate us for our freedom” so people need to know why. Much like with Bin Laden, going over why Bin Laden did was often see as ‘justifying 9/11’ as we can see here in the famous Paul-Giuliani moment. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0).

However I want to re-state again so it is perfectly clear THIS IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR WAGING WAR ON A COUNTRY WHO HAS NOT ATTACKED YOU.

This is probably one of the first foreign policy issues I can remember I got dead wrong. I thought no way Russia was going to march to Kiev. Not to say I’m some crazy expert whose never wrong, but I never been wrong to this level so naturally I had to reflect and do additional research on why that is.

Now from here on I put aside my views and will discuss the History of how we got here and Russia’s motivations and from a pure Machiavellian sense and after doing my research quite frankly I’m surprised the invasion took this long.

\*\*The motivations\*\*

There are 4 main motivations when taken individually some are enough on their own are enough for Russia to invade however together it makes it inevitable. The 4 are:

Nationalistic – The Russia state originated with the Kievan-Rus. Therefore bringing it back into Russia proper would be a glorious accomplishment for the motherland (again remember I’m talking in an analysis sense I don’t believe that but from here on out I put myself in Russia’s shoes so last time im disclaiming). However Russian nationalism is probably the weakest point and would not be enough.

Strategic

Economic

Demographics

**Nationalistic**

I briefly described this but lets delve further. As a an-cap I hate nation states and would be fine with decentralizing as much as possible. I say this because this point is factual but will anger many. Ukraine has never actually been its own country throughout history. Ukraine was not a country until 1917. Prior to that the area of Ukraine traded hands from the Rus to Lithuania, Poland, the Mongols and Russia. However notice the year, 1917. This was the start of the Russian Revolution. To not go too deep from modern Russia perspective Ukraine was entirely a by product of the Bolsheviks, and the separation is viewed by many Russians INCLUDING PUTIN HIMSELF as a tragedy splitting the Russian people. This is why the notion of ‘Russia wants the USSR back’ is false. It is a motivation of re-uniting an empire but not the USSR but the Russian Empire. Now of course Ukraine splitting was no problem for the Soviets. It was basically an administrative division and if it reduced the people there from causing any revolts why not let them call themselves Ukraine? Of course that changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union. When Ukraine broke away even if Russia wanted to split it and reclaim parts of the east as in the new Russian State they were in 0 position to do so.

This is a good point to jump into the strategic point, as when the Soviet Union collapsed the idea Ukraine would be out of the Russian sphere of influence and in the US and western Europe was not in the realm of possibility. Plus they had ‘the promise’.

**Strategic**

Lets start with the ever controversial ‘promise. An alleged verbal promise from HWB that NATO would not expand any further to the east. Now there are many counter arguments people have made to this to dismiss it. “It wasn’t written down so not valid” “it was made to the USSR and they dissolved” “NATO is a defensive alliance and countries fear Russia so its justified”. Now with making no judgement to the validity of those arguments, they don’t matter. This is seen often in our politics as well. Were talking about people here, you can make those arguments but to Russia those are irrelevant, THEY BELIEVE the US made that promise and BROKE IT betraying them and lying to them. Whether it was made/valid etc. doesn’t matter in this context, that is their position.

NATO then expanded east taking most of the Warsaw pact with it and now is looking to add Ukraine right on Russia’s border. Why is Ukraine so important strategically though?  They already have NATO countries like Lithuania etc. border them to the north west so we can dismiss “on our border” claim right? Well yes and no, that is the simplistic version of it.

Look at a map. Belarus is aligned with Russia and much like eastern Ukraine was historically part of Russia therefore in this context its an extension of the Russian defensive plan. In the event of conflict with NATO Russia is in a position to cut these countries off from the west through Belarus leaving only the sea to access. In addition they are much smaller countries so in the event of conflict Russia can at best quickly pacify that area or at the very least heavily restrict any attempts to use it as a staging ground for an invasion, therefore their NATO presence is tolerable to Russia.

Now lets look at Ukraine. First off in the event Ukraine is part of NATO then Belarus is surrounded on three sides by NATO. Making them unable to cut those countries off and make Belarus indefensible. This alone is a major strategic concern.

However the biggest has to do with geo-geography and a major reason for ever Russian conquest in eastern Europe in their entire history, the European Plain. Stretching throughout Europe to the Ural Mountains east of Moscow in Siberia this is long flat land that is difficult to defend. From eastern Germany to Russia this acts as a funnel. The mouth starts in eastern Germany and ends in the Ural Mountains. This funnel opens from Germany to Ukraine/Belarus widening to include all of Russia by the time you get to their border.

Russian military strategy has always rested in keeping the mouth of this funnel as small as possible. During the USSR, this was at its smallest point with Soviet control of east Germany. Fast forward to today with Ukraine in Russia’s sphere of influence that funnel is still manageable by Russia with Ukraine and Belarus providing a good buffer. The Carpathian Mts. In western Ukraine makes that funnel small, but with Ukraine in NATO the funnel is completely unmanageable. \[Look at this map to demonstrate how much this changes Russian defensive doctrine.\]([https://ibb.co/VvfYf8n](https://ibb.co/VvfYf8n))

As you can see from a pure strategic perspective Ukraine in NATO basically turns a war with NATO from a war they will probably lose but if they could hold the line they can make the war hard enough to sue for peace to a completely indefensible border. From the perspective of the Russians, this alone is enough of a threat and untenable.

**3. Economic**

Russia is Europe’s only Petro-State. Must like the ME Russia economy rests on their oil and natural gas reserves. Europe being the main buyers. With the Soviet break up Russia’s pipelines ran through Ukraine. Russia has had to pay billions in tariffs for transporting through Ukraine. However by 2024 with all the new pipelines since then Russia was on track to not have to use those Ukraine pipelines. Ukraine prior to 2012 had no major energy reserves like Russia. However that changed, it was discovered on the coast of Crimea and south west Ukraine HUGE amounts of natural gas. Combined with the advent of fracking making shale viable in the Donbass region and near the Carpathian mountain range Ukraine went from no energy industry to having the 14th largest reserves.

As you can see this presents huge economic consequences for Russia, if Ukraine is no longer in their influence and develops these reserves the economic implications would be devastating as Ukraine becomes a major gas supplier to Europe. After discovery European money poured in to build out these reserves.

Now disclaimer there isn’t enough solid evidence of this to make the claim there is some however. Also knowing history it wouldn’t be a surprise. This discovery of natural resources with having a pro-russian president made the possibility Russia could at least have a hand in developing and benefiting from it. However a 2014 revolution in which a pro-west government was installed would hurt Russia and benefit the US and Europe. I was not aware of how big these reserves and impact to Russia was. Therefore the idea that the CIA or other western groups had a hand in the 2014 revolution… seems extremely plausible. Also makes the actions of the Biden in Ukraine more questionable, now I know there are many dems here who will take major offense to that but… come on how many wars/governments have we overthrown for oil. Can we at least entertain the possibility that the opportunity to get Europe off Russia gas and cripple Russia economically is probably one of the biggest opportunities both in impact to Russia and benefit to the US Empire we have ever seen? If I was a statist neo-con I would quite frankly be pissed off if the CIA made 0 attempt to get rid of Russian influence in Ukraine.

Regardless that change in government lead Russia to take cinema in 2014 and support Ethnic Russian Rebels in Donbass in the east. Which includes 2/3rds of the gas locations.

Sidenote: Crimea gets all of its water from a Soviet era Canal to Ukraine, that was dammed by Ukraine after Russia takeover. Life in Crimea due to that has gotten worse since Russian takeover, including their worst drought in recorded history therefore in order to keep Crimea invading Ukraine and blowing that dam (which they have done so far already) was a major motivation as well.

**4. Demographics.**

This one is also another weak one but worth mentioning. Like much of the Western World, but worse, Russia is suffering from low birth rates. COVID accelerated that in Russia as well. Therefore there is the idea the Russian Army may be getting smaller and smaller as the years go by so they need to have the ability.

**Timing and combining the reason.**

Let’s talk about timing. In 2014 the Syrian civil war was going on. Therefore a total invasion of Ukraine and conducting two major operations at the same time probably did not appeal to Russia. For now they could take Crimea which from a strategic standpoint in there mind could not be lost under any circumstances. In addition they would support separatist ethnic Russians in the Donbass. They took Crimea firing only one warning shot and didn’t have a major operation in Donbass so resource wise it was as much as they can get for as little effort as possible and gave Russia 2/3rds of those gas reserves. Also this revolution just happened, therefore I’m sure they hoped that the situation could change and a new pro-Russian government would come.

Now fast forward to today. The US and others only pushed harder and harder for Ukraine to eventually join NATO and be pro-west so the idea they would go back to being pro-russian slowly died. In addition the Syrian civil war, although not completely over is no longer the major conflict it was with Assad now off his heels. In addition I think US politics played a major factor. Prior to Trump and even after the 2014 invasion, the American people didn’t necessarily like Russia however were largely indifferent to them and the cold war hatred had largely died down. With the “Russia Collusion” “Trump is Putins puppet” allegations that whipped the entire Democratic party into a firmly anti-Russian stance. However Putin may have hoped after Biden got elected these would now die off a bit but it has only stayed the same or increased.

With those facts comes demographics and Ukraine’s military. Even without Ukraine fully joining NATO the NATO nations have supported Ukraine and have been providing them with weapons, equipment, and training. In addition, if they were able to re-gain control over those gas reserves and get more wealthy the Ukrainian military would only get stronger and stronger while the demographics in Russia getting weaker and weaker.

With the military no longer engaged in any other conflict, the US becoming increasingly hostile to Russia, the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO leaving them completely vulnerable on their entire western border, Russia built up troops along Ukraine for his invasion with possibly the hope he could get an agreement at a minimum that Ukraine never join NATO. When the West basically said that promise would never happen the Russian’s in their mind for the future security of Russia both militarily and economically had no choice but to invade Ukraine. Now since this is the end I will just repeat that of course IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION OF INVASION this is all purely from a Russian statist perspective.",Conservative

Anyways, for some backstory, she's an associate manager for a local grocery store. I asked her how she's doing with supply-chain and labor issues, which is when I learned some questionable things about her hiring and supplier practises.

Regarding suppliers, she expresses an unforgiving nature when an order is but a few hours late. Apparently she is quick to source new suppliers, instead of starting dialogue with her current ones when they're having issues that no one can help. She said that she made no demands on them when they could not give her the kind of service she needed, and instead found someone who could. 

Regarding labor, she says that it is not difficult to judge which employees will succeed and which won’t. She prefers young people, especially those with rich parents. In her view, it's more likely that an employee with rich parents will have a more reliable vehicle, and be more likely to pursue education outside of the liberal arts, which brings up another thing- she actually avoids the more educated... I'm thinking that she's intimidated by them, and I'm unsure how she believes she'll succeed if she shields herself from the newest ideas and worldviews...

What's more, she's trying to start new businesses with her earnings, and she tells me that if an applicant for a loan ever mentioned his personal need or any personal feeling whatever, the interview ended and he was never given another chance to speak to her...

"Is capitalism antinatalist? Antinatalism is a philosophy that assigns a negative value to birth. It contrasts to natalism. Policies can be described as natalist or antinatalist. For example, subsidising childcare is natalist and subsidising contraception is antinatalist. The One Child Policy is antinatalist but the Three Child Policy is natalist.

Some view natalism as important and believe that policies should be implemented to boost fertility rate in order to fix the ""ageing population"" problem. However, others believe that low fertility rate is a good outcome which will help reduce congestion and improve the environment.

What I have noticed is that many countries seem to experience fertility rate decline as they become capitalist and especially when they have been capitalist for a long time (what some may describe as ""late capitalism"").

A good example is China, which although many would describe as a communist country, implemented reforms in the 1970s when Chairman Mao died and was replaced by Deng Xiaoping. The fertility rate then collapsed from about 6 babies per woman under Mao's Agrarian Socialism to about 1.3 babies per woman today after market reforms.

Based on these observations, it is tempting to think that capitalism as an economic or political system is inherently antinatalist.

What we can see from the history of many countries is that capitalism prioritises capital over labour and that capitalism encourages the accumulation of capital. Under Chairman Mao, it was illegal to own capital. However, under Deng Xiaoping, it is legal to own capital such as property, cars, etc.

When you own capital, you gain from other people's labour. So for example, suppose I owned a factory. Then I gain when other people work in my factory. I make profits off other people's hard work.

If I were to have children, that means that I must pay for the child. If I pay money to have a child, that means I have less money left over, which means I accumulate less capital. Therefore, in order to accumulate as much capital as possible, I will not have children or have fewer children. 

Furthermore, the more capital there is, the more work there is to be done. So suppose someone accumulates a lot of money from working and convert it into capital by building factories. They build multiple factories. Because of all these factories, workers now have more jobs. More jobs are created when factories are created. When workers work at these factories, they have less time to have kids. In fact, if someone spends a year looking after a child rather than work at a factory, they lose whatever income they would have earned from working in the factor. Capital accumulation has created a higher opportunity cost for having kids.

Moreover, the more children a worker has, the more he needs to pay for the children, which makes him more dependent on working. A worker who is childfree may be able to retire early in his or her 40s if they work hard and save money and invest in capital. However, if they have children, their retirement is pushed out to e.g. their 60s. 

When a worker has children, not only does he sabotage his early retirement but he also creates another worker (his child) who will be an input into capital in the future. So basically the benefits of procreation go to the capitalists who gain profits and dividends from their factories while the actual costs of raising the children fall on the worker.

To summarise, capitalism encourages accumulation of capital, which reduces fertility because having kids means you accumulate less capital. You have fewer kids or no kids in order to accumulate more capital. Furthermore, when you accumulate more capital, that capital, if labour is an input into that capital, will create higher opportunity costs for workers to have children. Moreover, the more children a worker has, the more dependent he is on capital, so if he wants independence from capital then he needs to have fewer kids or no kids. When a worker has children, the capitalists of the future benefit from having more labour that they can use to create more money for themselves. By holding capital, the labour that future generations provide to that capital can be harnessed for profit, but the costs of raising children falls on workers.

It seems then that capitalism disincentives procreation and incentivises being childfree or having few kids. Is capitalism inherently antinatalist?",Conservative

"Vice hit piece on Amazon’s ‘subsidies’ illustrates no subsidies at all “Vice wants us to know that Amazon being treated just like everyone else is a subsidy to Amazon. But this is Amazon being treated just like everyone else.

The argument here is about subsidies to business. The first error is in getting the definition of a subsidy wrong. Not taxing an activity is not a subsidy to that activity – it’s not taxing it. We do not tax people walking down the street — that is not a subsidy to walking down the street, it is not taxing it.

The numbers that are then reached – Amazon is subsidized by $4.8 billion – are therefore wrong. Simply because much of what is talked about just isn’t a subsidy.”

"How to properly explain private sector security I understand the private sector and everything, but when it comes to explaining certain things about it to people who are for government, I can't seem to figure out exactly what to say.

I've never been good at explaining things. I always understand it thoroughly, but when it comes out of my mouth, it sounds terrible.

A little backstory

I was with my girl and her parents, and we were talking about my girl's brother. Her brother doesn't think there should be police. I added my two cents by saying something along the lines of, ""I don't think there should be government owned police considering the government as a whole is rather corruptible. Instead I think there should be privatized security.""

Immediately her step-father started saying how without police, it would pretty much just be the purge. Then he started saying how private companies owning police would result is the poor not getting any protection.

Her mom agreed with me, and understood what I meant and they started arguing. I had no idea what to say after that without repeating what I had already stated prior.

How exactly would I go about explaining private sector security?",Conservative

"The NAP gets rather complicated the more you think about it. As the title kind of suggests I have been thinking about the NAP a lot lately. It often gets mentioned when someone talks about their ideal version of society. However most of the times it just gets thrown in there at the end with phrases like ""NAP applies"". 

While that is nice the application of the NAP seems like a rather complex thing to me.

For example who does it apply to ? Humans are pretty obvious. But what about animals that display some form of intelligence, social behavior and the ability to feel pain. A good example would be orcas or crows. If only the ability to feel pain counts it would have to apply to pretty much every living thing with a central nervous system.

Or how to deal with property that is the result of the violation of the NAP ? In a pure interpretation property which is the result of a violation of the NAP should not exist. However that would include pretty much all land that is owned by anyone. 

Idk maybe I am just overthinking.",Conservative

“For preventing disorders arising in several places within this jurisdiction, by reason of some still observing such festivals as were superstitiously kept in other countries, to the great dishonor of God and offence of others, it is therefore ordered by this Court and the authority thereof, that whosoever shall be found observing any such day as Christmas or the like, either by forbearing of labor, feasting, or any other way, upon such accountants as aforesaid, every person so offending shall pay of every such offense five shillings as a fine to the county”.

1) Property rights - Government is sort of an arbitrator between all of us, in that it defines who owns what. I've heard a lot of people explaining how this functions in an anarcho-capitalist society, but I'm just not thoroughly convinced.  

2) Justice system - I know the government isn't very good at this, but I'm not sure how anarcho-capitalism would make it better? It seems to me that this would affect the poorest of society the worst, as if you couldn't afford justice protection, your death or murder would go unseen or uncared.

"For the people who lurk here that would argue education should be free: a quick read Information is free. You can go out and gather any information you want. You can go out and obtain the resources on your own at zero cost to learn something. If you want to learn how to use a paid product, buy it and learn it on your own. Trial and error is free. 

Education isn’t free. And the reason it isn’t is because someone else has done the trial and error *for* you. They took the time to learn something on their own. That time is something they never get back. The time they take to teach others is also time that they’ll never get back. They’ll spend 2-3 hours a day lecturing, and 3-5 more hours a day grading and attending meetings or training sessions. Education is a *full time job* and someone needs to cough up the cash to pay the educators. At the end of the day, creating a curriculum and teaching it is *labor*!

The group of people that think education should be free are often the same people who think laborers should have all the power; “Seize the means of production,” right? Tell me, how would that fare for the education laborers? They’re not keeping information from you—the information is out there to access at no cost to you—it’s just harder to do on your own. They’re keeping their *creation* from you. Because that’s *their* life’s work, and that’s all *they* can make a living on.

"Dear Reddit, if you don’t think Elon Musk pays taxes, you’re an idiot. Over the period of 2014 to 2018, Musk reported $1.52 billion worth of taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service. He paid $455 million in taxes. That's a tax rate of ~30%.

https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-paid-little-in-taxes-2014-2018-propublica-report-2021-6

I am so tired of hearing/seeing the same trash on the front page.  No, economically illiterate public school teacher, you do not pay more in taxes than Elon.  No entire reddit anti-work movement and propublica, imaginary net worth isn't income.  But what about loans based on assets, ya you can go take out a home equity loan right now.  

We can debate income tax rates all day, but how I wish we all could learn the basic facts before speaking.",Conservative
"Mainstream news This is somewhat of a rant/question:

With those of you who are aware of how propaganda has played a role in wars over the years, I can’t help but feel that all major news sites are filled with propaganda on this whole Russian invasion into the Ukraine. It doesn’t matter if you are on a news site that is far right or far left, it all is insinuating that an invasion is imminent. Day after day, we see that there will be an invasion any time. What gives? Is there a news source that is actually reliable at this point? WTF is the point of Russia actually invading because I have read so many reasons and I honestly don’t even know anymore???

"Capitalism is Beautiful In this system everyone pursues their own goals for their own benefits. As such the best in this system learn if they give more to others they get more for themselves. It’s only by providing more and more for others do you get greater returns back. And even if you are the best today at delivering that value, there is always another and another and another looking to provide it better than you can. These battles can be vicious and the process of creative destruction is probably the most beautiful part. As people change and the world changes old incumbents die and like a Phoenix from the ashes new ones are reborn with a better method meaning more and more people benefit from the innovation. Of course it’s not perfect, it never will be. But it provides more opportunity for more people than any other system we know of.

"FROM THE MAKER OF 'STATISM: THE MOST DANGEROUS RELIGION' As a follow up/sequel (of sorts) to 'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6uVV2Dcqt0), I am currently working on a documentary length (60-90 minutes long) production with a working title of 'Voluntaryism: An Idea Whose Time Has Come' (although I am also considering the title 'Liberty Rising: The Philosophy of Anarcho-Capitalism'.

The film will be aimed at people who are either completely new to the philosophy of voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism, or who are half way to becoming voluntaryists/anarcho-capitalists (i.e. current minarchists), and it will guide the viewer through the philosophical groundwork of voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism, from the non-aggression principle, self ownership and the philosophical basis for property rights, to the fundamental economics and benefits of the free market (from an Austrian School perspective), the coercive nature of statism (and taxation), debunking all the most common philosophical justifications for the alleged legitimacy of the state (social contract theory, democratic consensus arguments, utilitarian/consequentialist arguments, et cetera) and, finally, it will address anarcho-capitalist alternatives to the ""services"" currently provided in a coercive, monopolistic, extortionate manner by the state.

The film will be made available for free on YouTube, although I am also planning to release it on DVD (at low cost), which people will be free to copy and distribute as much as they like to friends, family and total strangers.

I will be using plenty of narrated excerpts from both 'For a New Liberty' and 'The Ethics of Liberty' by Murray Rothbard, and I am hoping to also feature relevant snippets from talks/interviews by the likes of Stefan Molyneux, Tom Woods, Walter Block, Mike Huemer, Larken Rose, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, David Friedman, Robert Murphy, Lew Rockwell and others (providing I can get permission from all those people, and the relevant copyright owners). 

The whole video montage will be compiled in such a way that each segment flows coherently into the next, and all of it will be ""glued"" together with narration written by myself but actually voiced by a paid narrator (I hate the sound of my own voice).

I have already been working on this project for over a year now, and I have made a lot of headway, but due to work constraints, I have been unable to work on it anywhere near as much as I would like (ideally I'd be working on it full time), and there's still a fair amount of work to do. In a desperate bid to finally get this project finished and released, I am reluctantly asking for assistance.

The film features an abundance of nifty motion graphics, animation and stock footage (all designed or paid for by myself, except for any free/public domain stock footage I've been able to find) to help visually illustrate the points made in the video. As anybody involved in motion graphic design or animation will know, these endeavours can be extremely time consuming. If anybody reading this is skilled in graphic design, motion graphic design, animation, narration, or any other relevant areas, and is interested in helping with the project, please get in touch at 'johnnada80@googlemail.com'. I will obviously credit anybody who helps in any way in the closing titles.

In addition to assistance with the technical side of things, in the coming weeks I will be starting a kickstarter campaign, accompanied by a trailer to give people an idea of the production quality, style and content of the film. Basically, in order to finish the film, I need funding, to pay for things like stock footage (which really isn't cheap), a narrator, studio headphones/monitors, a computer capable of rendering complicated, high definition motion graphics (without taking two days!), a decent studio microphone and a website to promote the film (including website development, web hosting and domain name).

I would never usually ask for funding. I worked on 'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' for three months straight, pretty much full time, with many sleepless nights and 48 hour editing marathons, but that is only 12 minutes long, and the new film will be 4-6 times longer than that, so I'm going to need help if this thing is going to get finished anytime soon!

'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' has now been translated into over 12 languages (the last time I checked), and has already had over 300,000 views (including the translated versions and reuploads). In my humble opinion, the new film is significantly better, more persuasive and aesthetically pleasing, so it has the potential to blow my previous effort out of the water and really make a huge impact in getting the ideas of liberty (specifically voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism) spread around the world!

Well that's the end of my rant/begging. Watch this space for the trailer which will be released in the coming weeks/months, and please consider helping out with the kickstarter campaign which I will be starting soon!

If anybody would like to contribute via Bitcoin prior to the release of the trailer/kickstarter campaign, the address is: 1JfweLVprPCnUmRKpqC9uK7NZbZjt9XazW

Or, if you'd like to help out via Paypal, the address is: johnnada80@googlemail.com

Anybody who donates or helps out in any way will be credited in the closing credits.

Many thanks,

"Could a private military take on a super power like Russia. Is this an example on why the US needs to spend so much money on the military. No doubt there is a lot of wasteful spending in the US military industrial complex. Government wasteful spending and inefficiency go hand in hand.

But is the situation that we are in a good reason why we need a government backed military. Where as a private military wouldn't cut it? 

Its ironic how government military cause the most damage to humanity but are also used as the reason why countries need their own military.

Still, if enough people were to subscribe I think a private military would work. Mercenaries and companies like black waters are a lot more effective than their state ran counterparts. Imagine a business where you get rewarded for having confirm kills against an government ran invading army. You solve 2 problems, One you provide jobs and 2 you eliminate the government military.

"The best conversation I've had with a redditor in one of the mainstream subreddits Mainstream redditor:

>Let me ask you this and answer honestly: You have $500. You can spend it on hiring the kid next door to mow your lawn for $20 for a third of the year, or you can mow your own lawn spend it on a new game console. Which would you choose?

>We'll use the same scenario to answer your question about how the 1% enforces their wealth. Say you choose to hire the kid next door. You agree he will mow your lawn for a third of the year. He say he needs it to fund his dog's operation. He mows your lawn, and you pay him $20. You then decide you'd rather have a new console and can mow your lawn yourself. You can choose from multiple options: [1] you can nullify the agreement and be the neighborhood jerk, [2] you can tell him you'll lower down his pay to $10, [3] you can tell him you'll give him the $20 but he has to buy the gas for the mower himself from that $20, or [4] you can tell him to fuck off your lawn or you'll shoot him and gis dog with your shotgun.

My reply:

>If you have limited funds and you're set on reducing your lawn service costs, there are a few other options you missed. You can't present a complex set of solutions without covering all of them!

>* You can go to his competitor and offer $15 or however little amount he is willing to take. 
* Another option is you let your grass grow and just don't cut it, this is the cheapest route immediately since you don't even need gas or a mower for it, but could have long term costs. 
* You could salt/herbacide the yard and nothing would grow there, this would cost less than $20 and only have to be done once.
* You could let the grass grow and then try to light it on fire, probably not a good idea, but it's one way to handle it.
* You could start a service where you take care of people's goats and allow the goats to eat the grass. Thus earning yourself additional profit and solving the grass problem.
* You could let the grass grow full length and then cut it into hay, bail it, and then sell it for a profit. You could even pay the kid next door to do all this and break even without having to exert yourself much at all. This way you keep your existing money, the kid next door earns money, and someone gets hay for their animals or whatever.

>**Thank you for emphasizing a very important point. You only presented 4 options. And that is very much what the free market is like under government regulation. My solutions wouldn't have even been possible despite me coming up with a much better solution as my answer than if I had followed the government's rules and chose 1 of the 4.**

>The last option would probably be my answer based on a lot of assumptions I'm making about the problem, but it's very hard to say without knowing all of the circumstances.

In my experience there really are 2 castes for people- one will sacrifice their freedom (and yours) immediately, in order to secure access to this or that reward.  Another will sacrifice their rewards (yours too) to maintain their freedom.  

So in a free society, I still do not understand how the first group of people, something like a caricature of a peasant, can even exist without destroying that society and the liberty enjoyed by others, who make totally different decisions.

"A capitalist way to address capitalist problems Most of you on here are not a big fan of taxes and understandably so. A fact that far too few leftists are willing to acknowledge is that just about every tax carries a deadweight loss. At the same time, we still need the government to pay for basic essentials like infrastructure, law enforcement, and military expenses.

Furthermore, we are seeing rising housing costs which are keeping today's young people from being able to afford to own homes like generations before.

So what's the solution?

In order to really be able to discuss solutions, we need to understand just where the problem comes from.

To do that, we need to understand the three factors of production.

Labor: effort by man

Capital: Most goods fall under here

Land: Any good in fixed supply like land, space, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and geostationary orbits. While labor and capital have a potentially unlimited potential, land, being fixed in supply, cannot be increased.

Profit is likewise split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land). The traditional American idea is that by working harder, you improve your living standards while also benefitting society. There are two economic activities which benefit society - labor and investment. The former is typically what most people mean when they say work hard but investment can potentially take you much further than the former. That's why business owners and C-level people make so much money. And this is probably the biggest issue with Marx's labor theory of value. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't state that labor is the only thing which grows the economy but rather that labor is the only productive economic activity. Land and capital most certainly exist but they take on passive roles according to Marx. The factors of production, according to marxian economics, are labor, subjects of labor (land), and tools of labor (capital). According to the LTV, all goods and services derive their worth from labor costs (more specifically, socially necessary labor). The problem with the LTV is that it ignores investment as a way to contribute to the economy. Compared to labor, investment is less effort and more risk. Half of all businesses fail within the first five years with 20% failing in the first year. Some socialists go yet even further and state that all labor is worth the same with the only differential factor being number of hours worked. Just to be clear here, Marx himself did not believe this but others like Pierre Joseph Proudhon did. Proudhon proposed the idea of labor notes. The problem with this idea becomes obvious when you consider the disparity in skill required to become a janitor vs a brain surgeon. If everyone were paid the same, there would be a significant disparity in high skill labor.

This is probably the best video against socialism because it undermines the idea that labor alone creates wealth.

Which brings us to the big issue. You see, there's a form of investing that doesn't create wealth called speculation. If you buy an artwork for $150 only to later sell it for a million dollars because people now know that it was painted by someone noteworthy, you just made money without contributing to society. This isn't to say that speculation is entirely bad. In a volatile goods market, speculation can help to stabilize prices. But in markets where demand is rising faster than supply, speculation becomes easy. Markets with inelastic supply are particularly prone to this. One example is with artworks. With the kinds of artworks that sell for millions of dollars, most of their worth isn't in the artwork itself but in who painted it. Because these artworks are limited in supply and there's always someone who wants the original, they will sell for a lot of money.

It's in land that we see the pernicious effects of speculation. As you're starting to see, rent is unearned, unlike interest and wages because they reward the owner for essentially doing nothing. You might say the same with any investment since it grows passively. But the difference between investing in land and other things is that the growth in land value does not benefit society as a whole unlike growth in a business. Now obviously this doesn't mean that real estate investment is a scam. But there are differences. Real estate development creates capital. Buying land in the hopes that it will be worth more in the future does not generate any wealth. Land is in fixed supply giving it a perfectly inelastic supply. When it comes to demand, land is also pretty inelastic because we need land to live and work on. As a result, the amount that is charged for the selling and renting of land is pretty close to what people are willing to pay.

Land speculation is attractive because it offers a good reward with less risk when compared to other forms of investment such as starting a business or buying stocks. This is perhaps one of the reasons why housing is in short supply. Another reason is because municipal governments implement zoning codes which help prevent land from being used at its economic potential. This is a huge problem in the Bay Area where demand far outstrips supply. For a super liberal area, San Francisco does a terrible job of ensuring housing for all.

The good news is that there is a way to solve this issue. Meet the land value tax (LVT). The LVT is similar to a property tax except it only taxes the land rather than the improvements. Thus making improvements to your home will not give you a higher LVT. The LVT penalizes land speculation and incentivizes efficient use of land, making the LVT have a positive effect on the economy. If implemented at the state or federal level, it could also force municipal jurisdictions to rezone as the same people who push against new development would have no choice but to get them to change their zoning codes.

This idea is nothing new, it dates back to Henry George from the late 19th century. In *Progress and Poverty*, George detailed how land rent was the big issue with capitalism. His solution was the LVT. The idea was to raise the tax as high as it possibly could and use the surplus revenue to hand back to society in the form of a basic income. George was also pro free trade and was skeptical of intellectual property since that effectively granted a monopoly to the IP holder.

The idea dates back even further to Adam Smith who pointed out that land rent is unearned. Therefore, it's only fair for the government to raise revenue from taxing land value. Thomas Paine had a similar proposal to George in which land value would be taxed with 2/3 of proceeds being distributed to those over 50 (back then the average life expectancy) and the remaining third given to those under 50.

Milton Friedman considered the LVT to be the least bad tax

[https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes)

One objection to the LVT is that it would put land in the hands of the government. My rebuttal is that the same could be said for any tax. An income tax is the government claiming ownership over your labor (i.e. slavery). By that logic, a property tax puts all municipal property under the ownership of the city government. If you still think that the LVT is socialist, perhaps you ought to learn what actual socialists thought of the idea such as Karl Marx. In short, socialists like Marx didn't like George because the latter was going after land rent while leaving capital alone.

[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81\_06\_20.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81_06_20.htm)

Another objection is that this will negatively affect farmers. It's easy to think this because farmers grow stuff out of the ground, therefor the LVT will be punitive. However, you have to remember that we're talking about a land value tax, not a mere land tax. This means that land in better locations will be valued more than those in more remote locations. In other words, land near the city center would be taxed at a much higher rate than land in the rural areas. If the LVT would hit any sector of the economy the hardest, it would probably be big retainers with their massive parking lots.

The third objection is that renters won't really benefit because landlords will simply shift the cost onto tenants. But as mentioned before, renters are already paying close to what they would be willing to pay (assuming there's no rent control). In other words, landlords can't raise rents because they would have otherwise done so already. For some reason, we don't assume this about other taxes. If we lower taxes, people have more spending power, therefore, landlords raise rents because people can now afford to pay more.

In conclusion, the LVT is a conservative solution to the housing crisis and to taxation because it will benefit the economy and make it easier for the younger generation to achieve the American dream.",Conservative

"Defensive Wars in an Ancap Society Assume the US decides today to privatize all functions of government, and Canada decides tomorrow to invade the US, forcing all the Canadian citizens into conscription and taxing them at a 93% rate.

On the question of how the anarchist society would defend itself against the Canadians, several issues come to mind:

1. Coordination problems. There may be thousands or tens-of-thousands of private defense corporations, but these firms get paid by their customers to defend only their customers. How do all the defense firms band together to coordinate the war effort, especially given that one defense firm doesn't want to defend another defense firm's customers? Isn't it more efficient to force them under the command of one man, force them to share information, and etc.? Say these Canadians start attacking at Niagara Falls in order to conquer New York. Why would the Californian defense firms give a shit about the New York customers?


2. Freeloader problems. I think we can assume the defensive war effort will cost more than what I am already paying to my private law enforcement agency. If my firm increases its prices, but the next firm does not, and I don't think the Canadians have it in them to win, what is preventing me from switching firms to the cheaper one and leaching off everyone else who pays the increase fees?


3. Additionally, it's commonly stated among ancaps that nuclear weapons would not be developed in our society as no profit monger could justify the expense, of which only a State war monger could because of revenues from taxation at the point of a gun. However, what about Canada? They decide to invade, they have increased the tax rate of their citizens at the point of a gun, and they have developed nuclear capabilities. Don't we need at the least some Iron Dome type system to stop nuclear bombs coming from Canada? Isn't this extremely expensive - i.e., requiring a State with Force? Even when a few defense firms create iron domes, the coordination and freeloader problem arises. Why should I pay any of them when I believe other people will pay for ""my share""? And, God-forbid I mention it, wouldn't a nuclear deterrent also be useful in this situation of preventing another non-ancap nation from attacking us?


4. Bribery. Canada has a gun to the head of its citizens and is forcing them to pay a 93% tax rate, generating a substantial sum of money. What is to prevent Canada from successfully bribing the defense firms to either stay out of the fight or even join Canada? Or bribing them for information on other defense firms that they are coordinating with? With a State, the death penalty for traitors is used to prevent bribery.

Please do not answer this question with ""we need the entire world to be ancap first because then Canada wouldn't be able to use force on their citizens with a 93% tax rate to invade us"".

Please do not answer the freeloader question with ""once people live in ancap they would then voluntarily donate 93% of their money to the defense firms to protect their liberty"".

If you sell your labor to a capitalist, you are a laborer. If you operate capital for a living, you are a capitalist. Actually using words correctly is not ""the language of hate."" That's a brain dead opinion from a religious zealot trying to redefine words to support a political agenda""


The guy actually implied,based on his faint logic that a laborer who sells his labor to a capitalist is a laborer.

By following that premise,Lebron James who is earning bazillions of money is a laborer who sells is labor to the lakers(capitalist) mediated by a contract. If lebron is a laborer,then it implies that a laborer doesnt have to earn mediocre wages in order to qualify as a laborer. if so, A CEO is a laborer too, if a ceo counts as a laborer then based from the marxian logic,then laborers can be exploiters too.

"Debunking the Communist Personal-Private false Dichotomy [Diabetes Guy](https://youtu.be/EhKUowDwDe4)


The guy in the video argues that a toothbrush is a personal property and not a private property. This is again,implying like your date with a hot girl is personal but you and her having sex later is free for public consumption. The toothbrush analogy breaks into pieces when he said it is a personal property which implies that it is not owned privately,which extends to the logic that it is free for public consumption so everybody can use it. another way he described private property as some sort of social relation like how an employer owns the fruits of the employees labor. but the fact that the trade that took place with mutual consent between two person,makes it personal. so this implies that personal property is a function of private property. You can set personal discretions beyond the public's involvement because you're a private individual.

This is another model done by socialist i saw online 

https://ibb.co/x7gHGXL

If we express the numberline mathematically

a+b=0, or 1+(-1)=0
where 
A=Private property
B=Public property
0=Personal property

hence, 
0-(+1)=-1(Personal-Private=Public)
0-(-1)=1(Personal-Public=Private)

Those are mathematical expressions that even a one-eyed,left handed quadriplegic kid can understand. that Personal property without private property means=public property. so that toothbrush you own personally is subject to public consumption. also, personal property without public property implies =private property. which means private property= personal property. There's no really difference. Unemployed commies like that diabetes guy on the video are just inclined to hide behind the conveniece of semantics to fool not only other people but themselves too.",Conservative

first of all (this might sound a bit confusing)  say mcdonalds exists and someone else randomly opens a mcdonalds. its not a franchise, the original mcdonalds isnt making any of the money that this second mcdonalds is making. this second mcdonalds is making buckets of money from mcdonalds' creativity the original mcdonalds obviously cant get a patern or copyright because theres no government to allow that? can you educate me on this scenario and maybe how this wont happen? 

okay secondly, so all drugs are legal because enothings illegal. but what if someone were to sell drugs to children, could they do that, yes they can right? nobody will stop them its a victemless crime? are you saying its is okay to sell heroin to 14 year olds. if someone really had the morality to do that, could they? no one is gonna stop them.",Conservative

"Edward Snowden Betrayed Libertarians Edward stole state secrets and ran. He first landed in Hong Kong (since absorbed by the authoritarians) and then fled to Russia where he remains now.

Snowden, accompanied by Glenn Greenwald et al , working in harmony with Russian intelligence, stole much and subsequently publicized some of the work of intelligence officers in Australia, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Canada, France, and the United States.

A sincere libertarian would have stood his ground and faced all of the people in the public forum to be shown right, free and brave. But Edward wasn't interested in doing the right thing by or for the American people, and he wasn't promoting liberty. It was a theft of state secrets and methods that have since been reproduced and are now being applied by authoritarian regimes in Russia, China and elsewhere on earth with no oversight or accountability.

The technologies developed within democracy, with an expressed commitment to protect and serve all people equally, were lifted by Edward Snowden so he could pass them on to authoritarian gangsters to be used against not only their own people, but the people across the world who live for peace and freedom, the libertarians.

The bottom line is this: the property of the Australian, Dutch, British, German, Swedish, Canadian, French, and American intelligence agencies was taken by Edward Snowden in order to introduce the methods, techniques, and cryptographic technologies to the Russian, Chinese, and other adversarial intelligence agencies, like a new weapon to be utilized and introduced to the equation in those states. The right to privacy of all of the Australian, Dutch, British, German, Swedish, Canadian, French, and American peoples was broken. The property they created with public money, and rightfully own in their digital and physical space, was stolen from them.

The conversation has been and should continue to be had regarding the right to privacy and protections against illegal searches and seizures; it is up to the people's legislatures to serve in oversight and create the right rules, and it is up to the districts to lift up their best each year.

Like any tool, the intelligence systems revealed in the disclosures can be used to build or to destroy, to help or to harm. Edward Snowden lifted these precious tools and showed them to gangsters who use the tools they have to do serious harm.

Edward Snowden injured liberty then and today sits behind a man who is on the verge of shattering peace.",Conservative

"Handouts for the billionaires with our taxes.....             “Without taxpayer support, however, neither Tesla nor SpaceX would have survived this long, and investors never would have had the 
              chance to make massive bets on both companies.”

That allowed the company to show profits sooner than it would have without the credits, lifting the value of the stock. In fact it wasn't until the second quarter this year that Tesla reported more in net income than it got from regulatory credit sales. ""It was really US taxpayers that helped get him through his roughest time,"" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares — today. In 2019, he was still skeptical as the company struggled. ""If it didn't have regulatory credits, Tesla would not be the brand it is around the globe, and Musk wouldn't be the richest person in the world,"" Ives said.

Tesla buyers received total federal tax credits worth an estimated $3.4 billion before the perk disappeared entirely at the end of 2019. Even if that only allowed Tesla to raise prices by half that amount, that's another $1.7 billion in federal help, on top of the $5 billion it has received— so far — from regulatory credit sales.

And then there's SpaceX, which is a smaller but still significant source of Musk's wealth. The taxpayer support for this venture is even more clear, since it comes in the form of direct government contracts that are worth billions. According to Sam.gov, the government database that tracks federal spending, Space X has signed contracts worth nearly $10 billion. None was more crucial than the one the company received just before Christmas in 2008, when Space X and Musk were both virtually out of cash.

“They were right on the edge of insolvency,"" Dreier said. ""Elon has pointed out at that moment they were on the edge and that helped to save the company."" Dreier said the ISS and other contracts have worked out well for NASA, too, allowing the agency to use SpaceX rather than relying on the Russians to transport US astronauts. SpaceX has since gotten numerous additional government contracts from NASA, the military and other US government agencies. It won a $3 billion contract to develop the next vehicle to carry astronauts to the surface of the moon. And Dreier said SpaceX and other NASA contractors also benefit from the agency's in-kind support, including access to NASA employees and expertise.”

"How the hell is Capitalism fair?? And don't start writing comments about how I'm a communist or anything like that. Sure, I'm a leftist, but I live in a capitalist society so I'm forced to play the hand I was dealt.

The problem is...I'm so incredibly overwhelmed...lemme explain.

I'm a college student, and because of abusive family relations, I support myself. I am 19, freshman, living in the US. 

I have two jobs, yet still have panic attacks daily about not being able to afford rent.

My monthly budget for groceries is 50$.

I barely make a net savings every month.

I can't afford insurance of anykind. If my car breaks or I get in an accident I'm fucked.

You want an example of how much this capitalist system has fucked me?? I have had a prescription for new eye glasses sitting on my desk for two months now. I can't afford to get new glasses to even see. There's not room in my budget for that.

How is this system fair? I'm working my ass off and I'm suffering. I can't sleep at night because I'm constantly trying to find ways to earn money. I can't even focus on academics...first semester of college and I had to withdraw from a class. 

At the very least why can't stuff like healthcare be free...that way I'd at least feel a little more protected...and if Im lucky that could probably pay for my glasses too. 

How is this fair? Why do I work so damn hard yet I suffer and struggle to put food on my plate? All I eat is cereal and ramen...

I think I'm actually working myself to death. How the hell do people think this is fair??

"Why I think anarcho-capitalism would ""work"" for roughly 1 generation. \- Unregulated private schools would each teach a different curriculum, with ideologies baked in. Students will be so indoctrinated by certain schools that any school giving a better education will appear to be lies and propaganda to them, and they'll send their kids to the same school they went to. Those who go to more legitimate schools will have their options more open, so over time more and more people will go to the brainwashing schools. Any ideology can turn towards authoritarianism with enough blind adherents.

\- Privately-owned media will be the same way.

\- Private security forces will realize that it's easier to protect a contiguous area than a discontinuous one, and mark off territory, forming local monopolies. This'll have the added effect of giving the customers in their territory little choice in who to hire.

\- Somebody has to manufacture the guns. As weapons technology advances, the latest weapons will become harder for individuals and small firms to make (or maintain, or supply). Every Podunk village used to have a local swordsmith working independently. How far away is your local tank smith? Can you make anything in your back yard to compete with a cruise missile? A billion-dollar company sure can.

\- Vertical integration. Depending on another company for yours to operate is a fault.  Defense companies will want to merge with weapons manufacturers to save money on guns. They'll also want to own clinics for when their officers get injured on duty. Rental properties will buy out defense companies to defend their property and enforce evictions. Schools will want to merge with rental properties to provide student housing, and with media companies to control their students' exposure.

\- Any company looking to use aggression to get its way will seek out people without protection, or with insufficient protection. Somebody considered it worthwhile to form a state the first time. They will again. Especially if they control the weapons supply, the ""security"" forces, the land people live on, the water/food/medicine supply, and/or the education system.

\- You can't just own a part of, say, a river. What you do upriver impacts water supply downriver. What you do downriver impacts trade access upriver.

\- Automation will eliminate unskilled jobs, and the cost of quality education will eliminate skilled labor. Why do you think we have a labor shortage and a job shortage at the same time right now? Unemployed, uneducated people with little to do and a grudge against the people denying them food and healthcare won't be very peaceful. If there's one thing capitalism is good at producing, it's socialists and communists.

&#x200B;

"Help figuring out Libertarian ideas on economics Hi, I'm new to the realm of libertarianism and politics in general so please bear with me if this has been asked before haha. I have asked around but I think people assume I am a troll or an idiot so I just decided to make a post.... I have always liked the ideas about individual freedoms and the ability to have complete agency over your life which is why I am here. One of the main questions that arise in my mind now that I take a serious look at libertarian ideas is how we address the question of big business. I am curious what your guys thoughts are about, what I would see as, the natural path of big business unhampered by regulation. I think back to learning about Standard Oil or Carnegie Steel etc and how they eventually bought up everything from the natural resource sites, to the means of transporting it, to the factories making the products etc... making it essentially impossible to enter the market as a small business.  With the lack of competition, or even with competition, when I look back at times with less regulation I see things like workers being paid at subsistence rates and massive income inequality. I see things like the triangle factory fire where the factory was literally locking people in to work. 100+people per 1 toilet etc. I kind of feel like if left unhampered big corporations would become incredibly powerful. They already manipulate the government with their massive amount of power and money, it seems if they could have it their way they would get rid of all regulations on them all together and are glad to have libertarian support in that way. Is there a general consensus on how to approach these difficult topics without government intervention?  As a side note, it almost seems like you'd end up in a new age feudal Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk run city if you really took it to the extreme, nothing would stop someone that rich from raising a private army/police force right?

Your dollar is your vote. It can also be expression. Personally, I love this “cancel” culture. When you can’t legislate your way out of a problem, or gun your way through it, you still have the non-aggressive pathway of choosing not to support that thing you dislike. And you have the freedom to also try to convince others to do the same. Those people can choose to tune you out. 

It’s all a series of Zeros and Ones. 1 0 1 00 1 1 and so on. To “cancel” something is like zeroing something. Either support or don’t support. One vs Zero. Simple. 

A boycott is a signal that you’ve gone from 1 to 0 on a thing. It’s about as direct an experience of democracy as you can have. Nobody can single-handedly cancel someone or something. You don’t need government to do it.

""The formula for the rate of profit, (s/v)/(c/v + 1), leads to the result that the rate of profit is higher in those industries where the organic composition of capital is lower, i.e., labour intensive industries. This contradicts the empirically given fact that the rate of profit is constant across all industries. Marx had to explain how this phenomenon of the general rate of profit comes about.""

https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/a.htm

Now, i really don't know where to begin because the false premise of the quote is too loaded that it takes an entire economics course for one to understand why its not the case. 

This , (s/v)/(c/v + 1) function from the quote above is fudged to come up with a desired outcome which is based on the ricardian model of value which was later skewed by marx as he sees fit and called it "" labor theory of value""

this function , (s/v)/(c/v + 1) falsely assumes that    variable capital(v) or Labor,is a multiplier(v^2) and commences at the premise that surplus value is denominated by 
labor(s/v)which is again,just the same old ricardian nonsense(LTV)

If we're going to derive , (s/v)/(c/v + 1) 
then
f(x)=scv^2 or f(x)v^2sc
S=Surplus
C=constant capital(investments such as land,machineries,employee training(human capital)
V=Variable Capital(daily labor operation or simply labor)

f(x)=scv^2 to explain this for laymen. it means for every 1 labor,there is 2 surplus value generated or much simpler a 1:2 ratio. at least that's what the marxist page implied and as i said a stupid fudging of the production function to satisfy the Old outdated and false notion of labor theory of value.

We know that Labor is not the source of surplus and labor is compensated by wage not profit.even in industries where labor is intensive such as BPO industries or massage parlors or generally sectors that provide services. we know that inspite these industries are labor intensive, without capital and business investment such as employee training or prime lots for operation. these people are basically unemployed and Capital is willing to incur the risk even confronted by the prospect of uncertainty when it comes to profit.",Conservative

"Do ancaps/libertarians/conservatives consider Marx's ""Das Capital"" a good understanding of Capitalsim?

The second you think that capitalism is slavery or theft, you're not talking about capitalism, you're talking about illegal and immoral actions that some people get away with because we ALL live in authoritarian societies with overreaching governments enacting varying degrees of tyranny upon free peoples.

That isn't capitalism.

So what IS capitalism? This is by far the best definition from my perspective:

>Capitalism is the state in which property owners hold exclusive authority over their property.

But this definition requires defining of terms. Specifically, property, and through proxy of *property*, *ownership*.

*Property* simply refers to any *thing* of which a human being might have ***a will to own***. *Thing* here is simply a placeholder term - a variable. Literally anything can be a thing. A thing can even be an abstract idea.

Ownership can only actually be one thing, else it actually is a non-thing. Ownership is a logical order of operations stretched across time. Ownership has two primary attributes required in its manifestation.

1. A human being must have *a will to own* a *thing*.
2. There cannot already be *a will to own* made manifest from another human being in regards to that *thing*.

1 is required because if it does not exist then nobody even wants to own it. A will to own is a synonym phrasing to simply declare that someone desires exclusive authority over that something.

2 is required because if 2 does not exist then there is already an owner. You cannot own something that is already owned because any attempts to obtain exclusive authority over something already owned unless the current owner consents (wills it) to it is theft, and you cannot own something stolen, nor can you steal what you already own.

So say you are the only human being on the planet and you manifest a will to own something. You now own it. You own it because you have exclusive authority over it and because both 1 and 2 have been manifest. There is literally no contest to your ownership, it simply is, as a default.

Now if you bring that thing back to other people and I notice it and suddenly I also manifest a will to own that same thing, I cannot also own it without your permission because any action on my part in which I attempt to circumvent your will to own is my attempt at theft. I cannot own something I've stolen.

The notion of owning what you've stolen is patently absurd. If you can own what you've stolen then theft doesn't exist, and if theft doesn't exist then neither does ownership. Ownership - like all ideas - must have an attribute of which manifests the idea as a ""something"". Ownership must provide exclusive authority else it provides nothing. If I have $10 and you can take it from me and use it without my consent then my ""owning"" that $10 gave me nothing. If you took that $10 from me and I went to others and told them what happened and nobody knew who to give the $10 to then ownership has no meaning.

Now yes, you can have exclusive authority over something you've stolen, but that doesn't make you the owner, it merely makes you the robber. One primary purpose of ownership is that other people would understand that as the owner, any other people who attempt to rob owners should be punished and forced to give back what they've stolen. Ownership MUST MEAN what I'm outlining otherwise it would be impossible to do this. Literally laws protecting people from the machinations of others could not exist without this logic.

So going back around to the beginning here, capitalism is the state in which property owners hold exclusive authority over their property. This means that everything from theft to murder, enslavement, rape, fraud, and so much more are ALL anti-capitalist. NO society exists in a completely capitalistic system, because ALL systems are partly capitalistic, partly socialistic, etc.

Socialism/communism, in contrast, can ONLY be one of two potentialities: Either it is a potential state of capitalism, or it is the opposing state of capitalism: The state in which property owners do NOT hold exclusive authority over their property.

You cannot argue that ownership is anything other than what I've espoused. Literally ANY other definition is arbitrary and will break down logically as real-life examples are brought to bare. A single human being cannot simply ""declare"" what ownership is, because that renders the definition of the very idea itself as utterly arbitrary. That's AUTHORITARIANISM.

I am actually not making up the definition of ownership, I am scrutinizing LOGIC to UNDERSTAND what it MUST mean in order for it to exist within the confines of a series of objective premises, such as that no human being desires the circumvention of their own will, and that it is not objectively possible to rank-order subjective value structures so as to quantify who's values are greater/lesser.

**TLDR:** **No** capitalist thinks capitalism is anything other than a system in which people own their property and aren't having it taken from them.",Conservative
Is Taking Money From Government Compatible With LIbertarianism? ,Conservative
"Who's right: Ancaps or the Chicago school? Let's measure their cocks to find out (serious, read) For centuries, economics has been plagued by a crippling flaw. It has even been called ""the wretched science"". Why? Because unlike real scientists, economists cannot run controlled experiments. We cannot just build two countries or even cities, give them identical starting conditions, make their economic policies identical except for one, and then write down our observations six weeks later. And for a while, it seemed like this would always be the case.

But lo and behold, the 21st century has offered a solution: video games! Minecraft, specifically. It is now easy to create multiple identical virtual worlds; fine-tune their rules without politicians getting in the way; populate them with test subjects for whom sickness, poverty, and death have no real-world consequences; and watch them like little virtual human ant farms!

So, here's the setup.

Server 1: ""Ancapistan"". The only way money enters circulation is by people digging gold out of the ground and converting it into coins. There are no taxes, and land belongs to the first person who gets there, but your claim is only as good as your ability to defend it with a sword because PvP is ON!

Server 2: ""Georgetown"" (named after Henry George). Fiat currency enters circulation in the form of a UBI. Where does the UBI come from? I don't know, maybe the ghost of Milton Friedman drops it out of a helicopter. Land claims work on a land tax system, and there may be other ""money sinks"" (in-game mechanisms that players can spend money on, which is then removed from existence) in order to control inflation. PvP is off, because this is a magical land where making things illegal prevents them from happening.

For added hilarity, the two servers can have different names for their currencies. One could be named the ""NORFED liberty dollar"", and the other could be the ""hundred trillion Zimbabwe dollars"", because that's a thing that you can do with server plugins.

The two servers would otherwise have identical maps and rules.

Each server will be tasked with building a [giant golden cock and balls](https://youtu.be/4wgQvij3rVE?t=214) in the middle of the map. After an arbitrary period of time, Worldedit would be used to determine the number of gold blocks used in the construction of each. Whoever has the biggest dick will be declared the winner.  

Obviously, this wouldn't actually prove who's right *in the real world*, but it would be a fun experiment, probably generate a lot of hilarious news stories (due to the [victory condition](https://youtu.be/4wgQvij3rVE?t=258)), and maybe even get serious economic papers written about it.

"“If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with.” From Bezos' final letter before he stepped down from running Amazon:

&#x200B;

""If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out."" -

[https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders)

&#x200B;

In the letter he pretty much outlined what Amazon has accomplished so far:

1. Pioneered cloud computing almost a decade before any of the other tech giants (Google, Microsoft)... Which has allowed other companies (Reddit) to grow and scale to where they are today.
2. Has given small companies and businesses the same compute resources as a giant tech company via AWS.
3. Has given people a lot of their time back that they would’ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.
4. Has employed over 1.5 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $18/hr and good health benefits. Amazon’s net profits in 2020 was around 21 billion dollars. They pay their employees 90 billion dollars in wages and other benefits.
5. Yeah Amazon’s founder has 180bn net worth. But by founding and spearheading Amazon, he also created \~1.6 trillion dollars worth of wealth for other people (Amazon’s total market cap is at 1.8 trillion dollars). A large portion of that wealth are in pension funds, 401Ks, and Universities.

&#x200B;

Overall I think the reason why I think a lot of people hate him and Musk is due to something called crab mentality:

&#x200B;

""Crab mentality, also known as crab theory, crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket, or pot) mentality, or the crab-bucket effect, is a way of thinking best described by the phrase ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". The metaphor is derived from a pattern of behavior noted in crabs when they are trapped in a bucket. While any one crab could easily escape, its efforts will be undermined by others, ensuring the group's collective demise.

&#x200B;

**The analogy in human behavior is claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to reduce the self-confidence of any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, resentment, spite, conspiracy, or competitive feelings, to halt their progress.""**

&#x200B;

That's why a long time ago people were fanboying over Elon Musk when he was in 15-20th place. But as soon as he became the richest person on Earth suddenly everyone wants him to fail now. And that he and Bezos should stop focusing on space travel and instead donate that money to other people.",Conservative

"Those who have an intuition of eco systems should not have a problem understanding and admiring capitalism Capitalism is like a jungle. Everything competes freely for resources. Efficiencient use of resources is rewarded to a certain extent. For example a tree that compete well for the sunlight gets to grow larger and spread it's seed by employing other life forms. But when it gets old, inefficient and too big, it collapses under its own weight. This opens opportunities for other smaller shrubs and trees. In a jungle all life forms vigorously compete for resources and this puts them under a strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to the evolving environment. This innovation is achieved by keeping the beneficial mutation out of of many useless, or even harmful, random genetic mutations. A Jungle sustains itself, supports diversity and provide ample opportunities for all life forms.

Communism is like a garden. It looks pretty and there is an order. Resources are distributed according to what is deemed optimal by someone, who might often be wrong. Only few species are selected and natural diversity is destroyed. The gardener trims freedom regularly and new ideas are weeded out.  After some generations species start to degenerate and catch disease. There is no eco system and a garden cannot sustain itself.",Conservative

Other species and robots/AI are as much residents of the countries that they reside in as humans are but they get no say in how it is run. My local government recently passed another deer cull due to how many of them there are and how much economic damage they've been causing and I can't help but think what if the shoe was on the other foot and the deer organized a human cull. I do generally think this is going to be the most likely way the future is going to go since history has been all about giving rights to more and different groups of people so I see no reasons why we don't eventually expand those rights beyond humans.

Yes, it is weird that people ""choose"" who gets to order them around in a democracy, and you've made a lot of theories to solve this problem. I've made a lot, too. But I, Alan Agnew, am excited to share with you that theocracy will be established and fix things. Yes, I used to believe in AnCap theory, but, honesty, we don't have that power, intelligence, wisdom as Jesus does to solve everything that can go wrong with your society.

So, here's the commentary by [Victor Hafichuk](https://www.facebook.com/victor.hafichuk/posts/2099070393609111) on the video:

>Jeremiah the prophet said, ""Lord, I know it's not in man to determine his own course"" (Jeremiah 10:23). In Samuel the prophet's day, Israel had a theocracy, a government not by fallible kings and people but by Perfect and Infallible God Himself. But Israel insisted it wanted to be like the rest of the world of independent, ungodly nations, having a king to lead them to war and to govern all the affairs of their nations. They came to Samuel with this demand. God told Samuel to let them have what they wanted. They were rejecting God's rulership. They wanted to follow someone they could see because they had no faith to follow and obey God Who proved Himself to them in every way feasible.

> So, they got their way and ultimately, it's been tragic ever since. See what Israel has been through in history to this very day, as bad as the rest of the world, even worse. So, the answer to Israel's problem is to return to God's Personal Rule - yes, what we call a ""theocracy"" - no kings but Him, no politicians, no human government, no corrupt, though ""well-meaning"" men making decisions by their own volition and wisdom for the people. 

> The world's problem is the same and the answer is the same as that of Israel's. Until they declare that Jesus Christ is their Lord, the Creator of all things, and determine to embrace His Way and Law of Life,  they'll continue to steal, kill, and destroy one another. They will continue to be in conflict, insecure, fearful, poor, resentful, and lost, without hope. 

> It's our choice who we're going to answer to, God or man. Because we don't believe in what we don't see with our physical eye, we'll choose a ""hero"" every time to lead us everywhere, in everything. And if we don't like the way our leaders are doing things, we may try to grab the reins of power ourselves and make things right, even with good intentions. And we'll end up following the same methods, traditions, and customs, making the same mess our former leaders or heroes made, and on it goes.

> We've now arrived at the Valley of Decision. This is the end of the ages we're in now. Will we choose death, returning to ""the normal,"" or will we choose life? Will we continue to insist on our own way or will we choose to believe God?

in fact most of these men making abortion laws are actually MORE qualified than the screening feminist with a protest sign..

these female supremacist arguments are full of egotistical narcissism as if bleeding out ur vagina somehow makes u a scientific expert lol. 

Why, if an organism was found on Mars it would be considered life but an organism on Earth isn't? Why is it illegal to break an Eagle's egg, but not illegal to kill a baby?

these same people who won't eat eggs because it's ""a baby chicken"" or who won't even eat dairy products because of ""animal cruelty"" but they're 100% comfortable killing something because it's ""inconvenient"". that's hitlerian eugenics

homeless people are inconvenienct too. they're smelly. should we go around killing them too?

also it's extremely sexist considering about half of women WANT abortion to be illegal

despite the divisiveness of the left (trying to make this like it's men vs women) there's a whole lot of pro life women

or do their voices not count (kind of like how anti-dmocrat black people's voices don't count to the racist left?)..

most of these women are less qualified to make laws on abortions than the men who are doing it

If a woman insists on murdering her unborn baby, then I guess it's up to the men to make those laws. 

just like if a murderer wants to murder then it's up to everyone else to make laws against it

""hey u guys can't tell me not to murder!! you've never murdered!""

we don't defer to rapists to make laws on rape

we don't defer to murderers and tell anyone else they can't make laws on murder

OF COURSE entitled Karen's who have abortions are going to be pro abortion

that doesn't mean that only they can make laws on it..

it should actually mean that they have a conflict of interest and should be the ones who ARENT allowed to make laws on it

non partisan third parties without a dog in the fight (and who actually study the issue) should be making the laws. not some karen who can't even name the parts of a fetus loll",Conservative

"I wrote a paper about the Kyle Rittenhouse Trial (I know a little late), what do you think? Anything I missed or got wrong?   

The Kenosha Riots and all of the subsequent press came just 3 months after the death of George Floyd. To say the least the country was in a flurry of ideas and action taken in regard to racial justice and the rising racial tensions. While not directly the cause for the now infamous riot in Kenosha, it did certainly help stir it up and explode the aftermath, being the Rittenhouse trial into nationwide fame. So now, we come to this, the case of Kyle Rittenhouse. Though officially acquitted of all charges on November 19th, was he really innocent? And was there anything the court missed?

There are two sides to the trial, the defense, and the prosecution. Their arguments will be summed up here. The Prosecution – His (Kyle Rittenhouse) possession of the Armalite Rifle 15 (AR-15) used in the shooting was illegal, He came to the riots (Kenosha riots) with the intent of killing rioters, He “shouldn’t have been in Kenosha”, and he was under no substantial threat from Joseph Rosenbaum (dead), Anthony Huber (dead), and or Gaige Grosskreutz (injured), the three people he shot. The Defense – All of the prosecution’s claims are false, more specifically, His possession and use of an AR-15 is legal, He acted purely in self-defense, and he “belongs” in Kenosha.

Before any arguments can be thoroughly analyzed however, one must set the scene so any statement made in regards to the case can be easily understood. So first off, the exposition, On the afternoon of August 24th, a day after the start of the Kenosha riots, Kyle Rittenhouse drove to Kenosha Wisconsin from his hometown, Antioch Illinois, to stay with his friend Dominick Black. The next day they both went out to help clean graffiti off a local high school. As the evening drew on Kyle Rittenhouse provided medical care and put out dumpster fires at some time acquiring his AR-15 rifle which he had purchased through Dominick Black earlier that year. He and his group of multiple armed individuals continued to put out fires and try to prevent destruction of property in the area such as the Car Source business which had lost 1.5 million U.S. dollars in damages the earlier night.

Shooting #1 - as the time approached midnight. Rittenhouse was walking down Sheridan Road, Joseph Rosenbaum spotted Rittenhouse and proceeded to chase after him. Rittenhouse seeing this, ran into the parking lot of the “Bert and Rudy’s” Auto service business on the corner of Sheridan Road and 63rd Street. Rosenbaum at this time threw a plastic bag containing most likely, socks, deodorant, and underwear at Rittenhouse. Joshua Ziminski, a random protestor then fired a gun shot into the air, unrelated to the chase. Rittenhouse then turned around, now midway through the parking lot and pointed his firearm at Rosenbaum. After Rosenbaum continued running at Rittenhouse unaffected, he turned back around and ran towards a group of parked cars in the corner of the parking lot at the side of the business. Rittenhouse decelerated as he neared the cars, turning around with Rosenbaum less than 10 feet behind and continuing toward him, he raised his AR-15 rifle and fired 4 shots in less than a quarter of a second, killing Rosenbaum instantly. Rittenhouse then jogged from between the parked cars and around back to the now dead Rosenbaum. Richie McGinniss, a bystander, then tried to help Rosenbaum as Rittenhouse stood over the body. Rittenhouse at this time called his friend Dominick Black telling him “I just killed somebody” before proceeding to run back up Sheridan Road, towards the police line. 

Shooting #2 - Word spread fast among the protestors that Rittenhouse had just killed a man, and after getting just one tenth of a mile from the first shooting, he is attacked again, at the corner of 61st and Sheridan Road. A group of protestors now hurriedly ran towards Rittenhouse, shouting “get him”, “he just shot someone”, “get his a\*s”. A protestor ran up to and hit Rittenhouse in the back of the head, knocking his cap off. Rittenhouse ran further until tripping and falling down. As Rittenhouse turned around, sitting up, Maurice Freeland jumped over him and kicked Rittenhouse in the upper body whether that be the arms or the head. Rittenhouse then, as Freeland was midway through the maneuver, fired two shots at him in around half a second, missing both. Directly after this, Anthony Huber went in to hit Rittenhouse with his skateboard. Huber managed to hit Rittenhouse on the shoulder and while doing so with his left hand purportedly grabbed Rittenhouse’s gun. He then however, tripped on Rittenhouse’s legs, falling nearly to the ground, his skateboard held in his right hand, falling flat on the pavement, brushing up against it for a just a moment. Huber continued on his original trajectory, hurriedly getting up again with his hand seemingly still gripping Rittenhouse’s rifle. It is at this point that Rittenhouse, now on his back, then fired a single shot at Huber, muffled due to the proximity to Hubers chest, the shot went through his thorax hitting a multitude of vital organs. Huber now dying, released his supposed grip on Rittenhouse’s rifle and his skateboard, both hands reaching towards his chest. He continued forward for a couple more steps before lying down on the ground and dying. Gaige Grosskreutz, who had been running towards Rittenhouse, stopped and ducked as the shot that killed Huber was fired. Grosskreutz was now just to the left of Rittenhouse holding a pistol but with both hands raised, slowly straightening back up from his ducking position. Rittenhouse at this moment, after seeing Grosskreutz with both hands in the air sat back up with his rifle pointed towards the ground. Grosskreutz then almost immediately put his hands down, hopping into a jog circling to the back of Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse spotted this in the corner of his eye, rapidly swiveling to face Grosskreutz. Grosskreutz now had his gun pointed towards Rittenhouse and his unoccupied left hand nearly in front of Rittenhouse’s AR-15. Rittenhouse at this point then fired a single shot into Grosskreutz’s right bicep, disabling his right arm as he turned the other way crutching it in is left hand, still holding the gun in his right. Rittenhouse then with no other immediate threats to him, stood up onto his feet and started walking again to the police line. Swiveling and looking around for any other assailants, he then broke into a jog before then again returning to walking and lifting his hands into the air for the police. Rittenhouse approached a police cruiser at this point trying to surrender himself. The police, not understanding, and insisting that he move out of the way so they could go deal with any injured civilians or the active shootout (which they did not know by now had ended) pepper sprayed Rittenhouse. Afterwards, Rittenhouse met up with his friend Dominick Black who drove him back to his hometown, where Rittenhouse then promptly turned himself in to a police station, just a hour after the shooting.

Now, to the guilt of Kyle Rittenhouse.

First off, was Rittenhouse’s possession of an AR-15 illegal? In the state of Wisconsin local laws prohibit the possession of firearms by minors but only to an extent. The law states that minors cannot own *short barreled* shotguns and rifles and because Rittenhouse’s AR-15 had a barrel longer than 16 inches, it was legal for him to own and accordingly open carry, as Wisconsin is an open carry state. It is important to note also that this means while Rittenhouse could not purchase a firearm legally at the time, it was completely legal for his friend Dominick Black to do so for him and as well that both Illinois and Wisconsin laws do not prohibit the carrying of firearms across state lines. Now, the rest of the charges are somewhat opinionated, there legal basis relying on whether or not Rittenhouse provoked the attacks (“A person who provokes an attack, whether by lawful or unlawful conduct, with intent to use such an attack as an excuse to cause death or great bodily harm to his or her assailant is not entitled to claim the privilege of self-defense.”) or if he acted “reasonably”, in order to stop the threat facing him (“a person is privileged to point a gun at another person in self-defense if the person reasonably believes that the threat of force is necessary to prevent or terminate what he or she reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference”). As one can see, “reasonably”, is a very opinionated word, so, while I can provide the evidence, ultimately, I cannot say for certain, whether or not he was “innocent” regarding these charges, besides merely expressing my *thoughts* on the matter. So, did Rittenhouse belong in Kenosha and subsequently, have good intent? Kyle Rittenhouse’s father, Mike Rittenhouse (divorced), lives in Kenosha Wisconsin and Rittenhouse visited frequently. As well as this, Kenosha is merely 21 miles from Antioch, around a 30-minute drive. These two facts bring reasonable significance to the town of Kenosha for Rittenhouse, and it can be assumed then that he had a will to protect the town. Now, for the really important part, did Rittenhouse provoke any of the attacks from the 3 assailants he injured/killed, and did he use reasonable force? Rosenbaum very openly disliked Rittenhouse for putting out a dumpster fire with a fire extinguisher which Rosenbaum was seen pushing earlier. Justice and Dylan Putnum both at the scene of the dumpster fire earlier that day (August 25th), were quoted as saying Rosenbaum said “why did you do that” in an enraged manor to Rittenhouse. There is no evidence of any other act Rittenhouse did to provoke Rosenbaum. From this, one can ascertain that Rittenhouse didn’t mean to upset Rosenbaum to the point of getting in a physical confrontation. It is more likely that Rosenbaum started the conflict with Rittenhouse being that he was seen visibly agitated at Rittenhouse and had a lengthy criminal record, including sexual misconduct with minors and extensive violations in prison, being of such nature as assault on staff (10 counts), disobeying orders (15 counts), and even one count of arson, along with a plethora of other infractions clearly showing him to be of a more violent nature, as well, there is significant evidence that he was off his medication at the time. The incentives of Huber and Grosskreutz would be harder to pinpoint. While they could also be angry at Rittenhouse for disturbing their rioting. One could also argue that they, as Grosskreutz has testified, were trying to stop what they viewed as an “active shooter”. Ultimately though, there two incentives would not matter, in terms of whether or not Rittenhouse provoked the attack as their interactions with Rittenhouse are captured clearly on video and Rittenhouse’s earlier shooting of Rosenbaum leading to the possible mis-assessment of the scene by Huber and Grosskreutz would be excused if Rittenhouse acted reasonably in self-defense. Finally, besides the “active shooter” explanation, there is no evidence Rittenhouse did anything else to provoke Huber and Grosskreutz. Now finally, was Rittenhouse justified in his carrying out of self-defense? Rittenhouse ran from Rosenbaum, tried to deter him by pointing his rifle at him, and continued on running until Rosenbaum was less than 10 feet away. 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse could either then, in this situation, have a possibly fatal brawl with 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, or shoot him. Which decision one considers reasonable is up to them but Rittenhouse’s attempts at escaping and dissuading the ensuing Rosenbaum as to not have to make this decision should be taken into account. Rittenhouse ended up firing 4 shots at Rosenbaum, this could be classified as overkill, but considering that the shots were rapid, within a space of a quarter of a second, and Rittenhouse was likely very nervous, it could well be attributed to his elevated levels of stress and the very close proximity of Rosenbaum. Rittenhouse from this point on was very restrained, firing the same amount of shots as he had at Rosenbaum but dispersed among three separate targets. Rittenhouse was either on his back or butt when he made the rest of his final shots, his targets being either on top of him or just a foot or two away. Rittenhouse was cornered in a sense, surrounded by rioters and soon to be engulfed, likely severely injured or killed if he did not act.

Now for the conclusion. So, was Kyle Rittenhouse innocent? It appears he was. On all accounts, His possession and use of his AR-15, was legal, He acted purely in self-defense, and he belonged in Kenosha on that night. Well, I hope you enjoyed reading and have gained a renewed perspective of the Rittenhouse case.

"Is global warming a significant threat to capitalism? The start of a new year tends to make me reflect on the events of the past year, and aside from covid the most poignant has been a greater emphasis on carbon net zero initiatives imo.

Personally with recent news of wild fires and hottest new years day since records began, it feels to me like the global warming issue is even worse than is being calculated.

I think the new generation is going to be fed news of impending doom for the future, caused by the decisions of the previous generations. I think as its looking more likely that we wont be able to prevent the global temperatures rising in time, a closer inspection of why? will occur, and inevitably the answer will lie on capitalisms relationship with consumerism and the vicious cycle or creating lots of crap nobody needs or 20 brands of butter and a totally unneccessary amount of choice everywhere.

Of course, money is the greatest incentive to innovation and capitalism could encourage the technology to save the day but imo the pendulum is moving the other way, and capitalisms pure inefficiencies on world resources may well see it overthrown, more likely to be replaced by a tech + socialism model OR countries exploiting the situation to monopolize resource through war.

This lines up with Wikipedia's definition, and I've always preferred open-source definitions. This would make the vast majority of the world Capitalist, and most people I've talked to in the political sphere have thought that Capitalism is the basic economic status quo.

So what're they defining it as? Where are they getting this definition from? And what would they call the economic system of, say, New Zealand?

"Why don't big businesses have to play by the rules? I'm based in UK and something I find consistently confusing is why, when large companies suffer from what I consider to be fairly unsurprising but non-routine business costs (current supply chain issues being quite an obvious one, the pandemic lockdowns last year - both of which were quite well planned for by governments and therefore you might imagine businesses too) if they don't have sufficient reserves, it is becoming fairly routine for governments to step in to rescue them? 

One current example is the energy industry in the UK, really what's happening could quite easily have been predicted, these energy companies make a LOT of money. Currently the government are now talking about raising the energy price cap, a measure which was specifically introduced to protect consumers from unexpected price hikes. Why do they not have reserves put aside to weather the storm? 

It feels as if once you get to a certain size in our capitalist economies, you get to stop playing by the rules which effect every other small business. My (admittedly basic, I'm no economist) understanding of capitalism is that it requires constant renewal, creative destruction, to ensure that the markets remain led by the most agile and responsive businesses, by this protectionism from government of the big boys in each sector leaves us in an oligarchy.",Conservative

"Do you think it is possible that one day the entire world (or the vast majority of it) could live in first-world conditions, through market economies? I know that poverty has dropped significantly in most regions of the world in the past few decades, but some regions are still very far behind the “standard” of Western Europe, North America, and Japan/Korea. There are also countries that appear to have stagnated - such as Russia, Brazil, Argentina, etc. So do you think that, with free market principles allowed to flourish, the vast majority of the world could one day live under first-world conditions? And what is the solution for those aforementioned nations where the economy and population has stagnated?",Conservative

"Examples of US-led election meddling by William Blum I know this is a generally anti-socialist subreddit, and Blum is certainly some kind of socialist. But I still think we can come together to condemn election meddling and the CIA generally.

Blum has a list of countries in the book Rogue State, where the US has interfered with their domestic politics to pervert their elections. These include:

**The Philippines 1950s**

Setting up by the CIA of a front organisation, the National Movement for Free Elections to promote its favoured politicians and policies, giving finance and other assistance to those candidates, disinformation, and drugging and plotting to assassinate their opponents.

**Italy 1948-1970s**

Long-running campaigns against the [Communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party) and to assist the conservative [Christian Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democracy_(Italy)).

**Lebanon 1950s**

CIA funding of President [Camille Chamoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Chamoun) and other pro-American  politicians; sabotaging of campaigns of politicians sceptical of American  interference in their country.

**Indonesia 1955**

CIA donated a million dollars to Centrist Coalition to attack the electoral chances of President [Sukarno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno) and the [Communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Indonesia).

**British Guiana/Guyana 1953-64**

Campaign to oust prime minister [Cheddi Jagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddi_Jagan), using general strikes, terrorism, disinformation and legal challenges by Britain.

**Japan 1958-1970s**

CIA funding of conservative [Liberal Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democratic_Party_(Japan)) against the [Japan Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Socialist_Party), allowing the Liberal Democrats to stay in power continuously for 38 years.

**Nepal 1959**

CIA operation to help [B.P. Koirala’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._P._Koirala) [Nepali Congress Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_Congress) to win the country’s first ever election.

**Laos 1960**

CIA arranged for massive fraudulent voting to ensure electoral victor of local dictator [Phoumi Nosavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoumi_Nosavan).

**Brazil 1962**

CIA and Agency for International Development funded politicians opposed to President [Joao Goulart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Goulart), as well as other dirty tricks against various other candidates.

**Dominican Republic 1962**

US ambassador John Bartlow Martin instructs the heads of the two major parties before general election that the loser would call on his  supporters to support the winner, and that the winner would offer seats  to the loser’s party. Also worked with the government to deport 125  people, including supporters of previous dictator [Trujillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Trujillo) and Cuba.

**Guatemala 1963**

Overthrow of [General Miguel Ydigoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Yd%C3%ADgoras_Fuentes), as they feared he was about to step down and call a general election, which would be won by previous reforming president and opponent of American foreign policy, [Juan Jose Arevalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Ar%C3%A9valo).

**Bolivia 1966**

[National Endowment for Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy) funded and helped form the opposition National Democratic Union, and drafted its platform, a *Contract with the Mongolian Voter*, based Newt Gingrich’s *Contract with America*. The goal here was to accelerate the regime’s privatisation programme and create government favourable to the establishment of American corporations and intelligence agencies in the country.

**Bosnia 1998**

US turns country into ‘American protectorate’ by appointing [Carlos Westendorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Westendorp) as high representative in 1995 Dayton Peace Accords. Before 1998 elections Westendorp removed 14 Bosnian Croatian candidates,  claiming reporting by Croatian television biased. After election removes  president of Bosnia Serb republic on grounds that he was causing  instability.

In 2001 and 2005 high representative also removed one of the three joint presidents of the country. In 2005 high representative Paddy  Ashdown, who sacked [Dragan Covic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_%C4%8Covi%C4%87).

**Nicaragua 2001**

US smears against Sandinista leader, [Daniel Ortega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_ortega), accused of human rights violations and terrorism. US ambassador openly campaigned for Ortega’s opponent, [Enrique Bolanos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Bola%C3%B1os). US also pressured Conservative party to withdraw from the elections so as not to split right-wing vote. There were also ads in the papers signed by Jeb Bush, claiming that Dubya supported Bolanos. Bolanos himself also stated that the Americans had told him that if Ortega won, they would cease all aid to the country.

**Bolivia 2002**

Extensive campaign against socialist candidate [Evo Morales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales) because he was against neoliberalism and big business, as well as the attempts to eradicate the coca plant, the source of cocaine.

US ambassador smeared him with accusations of connections to drug cartels and terrorism. US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere also said America could cut off aid if Morales elected. Meetings between US ambassador and officials and leading figures in rival parties to support Morales’ rival, Sanchez de Lozada.

**Slovakia 2002**

Warnings by US ambassador to the country and the US ambassador to  NATO that if they elected [Vladimir Meciar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladim%C3%ADr_Me%C4%8Diar), former president running on  anti-globalisation campaign, this would damage chances of their country entering EU and NATO. Also interference by National Endowment for  Democracy against Meciar.

**El Salvador 2004**

Campaigning by US ambassador and three US Republican members of congress, including Thomas Tancredo of California, threatening cessations of aid and work permits for the countries’ people to work in America, in order to prevent election of FMLN candidate [Schafik Handal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafik_H%C3%A1ndal) and win victory of [Tony Saca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Saca) of the Arena party. FMLN former guerilla  group. Handal stated he would withdraw Salvadorean troops from Iraq,  re-examination privatisations and renew diplomatic contacts with Cuba.

**Afghanistan 2004**

Pressure placed by US ambassador, [Zalmay Khalilzad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmay_Khalilzad), on political candidates to withdraw in favour of Washington’s preferred candidate, [Hamid Karzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai).

**Palestine 2005-6**

Massive pressure by the Americans to prevent the election of [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas), including funding of the Palestinian Authority by the National Endowment for Democracy.

This last country is my own suggestion, not Blum’s.

**Great Britain?**

Go and read various articles in *Lobster*, which describe the way the US and its various front organisations collaborated with the right-wing of the Labour party to stop possible Communist influence. In the 1980s Reagan also created the [British-American Project for the Successor Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British-American_Project), alias BAP, to cultivate rising politicians of both the left and the right, and make them more favourable towards America and the Atlantic alliance. These included Tony Blair and Ed Balls, but you won’t read about it in the *Times*, because it’s editor was also a BAP alumnus.

"Interpretation of K. Marx claims. 

               “The lower strata of the middle class — the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen 
           and peasants — all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which 
            Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is 
            rendered worthless by new methods of production.”
                                                                                    K. Marx 

Powerful companies, concentrations of wealth, and new methods of production make it increasingly difficult for independent professionals and middle-class merchants to maintain their status.   They end up with the wrong skill set or working for companies that have put their kind out of business.     In other words,  Marx anticipated the Walmartification of capitalist societies.

Marx did not simply dismiss capitalism. He was impressed by it. He argued that it has been the most productive system that the world has seen: 

                 “The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than 
            have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and 
            agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole 
             populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the 
            lap of social labour?”

"Which laws and incentives will effectively destroy every form of monopoly out there and promote free market competition? After taking a look at the US and some other countries, I see that there are a bunch of monopolies that slowly promote more unfair competition and less opportunities for small cap companies. 

To add more context, let's use the example of the 6 media companies out there: **Comcast, Walt Disney, AT&T, ViacomCBS, Sony and Fox.** Another monopoly will be the Oil companies and the fuel for the car industry which promotes car dependent cities. 

With this in mind:

* Which laws could decisively dismantle these monopolies and promote more competitors to join in?
* What incentive could be created to promote fair competition that could benefit us all?
* What could stop simulated shortages from oligarchs and create abundance in services and products?

I know that there is no country that has a completely free market, but, within the allowed parameters, there has to be a realistic solution that could improve the economy while being fair for everyone.

Thanks and I hope we could have an incredible discussion about this.",Conservative
"A Hypothetical Let's say you're in a libertarian utopia, and you buy some large tracts of land. You don't want anybody violating this property of yours, and decide to shoot trespassers on sight. This must be respected, nobody can infringe upon your freedom to say what goes on in your own damn property, no faggot government or nothin. But it seems that your lands stretch over a dirt road that you overlooked, and is used by the locals to get here and there casually. This doesn't stand with you, so you hire the pinkertons. They capture anyone crossing through your land and kill them. Now, since you are an enterprising person, you seek access to the ocean, and you work out a deal with a corporation wherein you buy some land which borders the sea. It turns out there are quite a few people living there, and you decide it would be unprofitable to try to purge them all together. But since they won't leave your property when you request them to, and they are not allowed to be there, you decide they might as well be put to good use. You send the pinkertons to force them into fishing and working in mines, all with quotas they must fulfill. You profit greatly from this, and buy more land. There are people living here too. You follow the same procedure, and after years pass you have millions of people under your freedom of jurisdiction and right to determine what goes on in your property. Sometimes they get rowdy and rebellious, so you decide it would be good for small children to be separated from their families and put into facilities that you had erected, and in these facilities they would be shown advertisements for your company, particularly advertisements that glorify you as a god and romanticize working for your company and promise good lives if work is done well. They would attend these facilities for about 6 hours a day. But then back to work. Your get old and die, and your son inherits your property. By this time a unique and homogeneous culture has developed thanks to your education facilities conditioning the minds of the young. Your son is widely celebrated among the people, and he feels they can be trusted to be hired as militia, to accompany the pinkertons, who had been getting very old lately. Your son wishes to expand the property even further. Luckily, the company with bordering land was not doing so well- the inhabitants of those lands had overthrown the owners, and of course this was immoral and illegal! Your son feels it is justified to restore order to the land, by force if necessary. So he mobilizes the people of his property, gives them weapons, and sends them off to battle against the neighboring savages. The result is a victory for your son, and so he annexes the lands. The army was happy to fight for their homelend and king (er, CEO). The assimilation process begins, with more facilities being developed in the new lands. Another generation passes, and the kingdom (er, property) is passed down to your grandson, and by this time the inhabitants of the new lands had mostly been assimilated. Unfortunately, the company which had formerly claimed those lands was upset over your company's holding of them, and they were ready to fight your grandson about it. They had also amassed an army over time, and so the war began. The battles stretched for 10 years, with no clear victor in sight. The people of your grandson's property began to become angry, and there was not enough money to be spent on schooling and assimilation, because the GDP had to be totally spent on the war effort, and so the people became increasingly militant and rebellious. Eventually your grandson was usurped by the youngest son of a wealthy family from within the property, who promised the people a better life and an end to wars. This man worked out a peace deal with the other corporation- they would get the lands back. The man's dynasty ruled fairly for a few generations, but skirmishes became more frequent with neighboring landowners once more. Some wars would be won, some would be lost; and eventually rule became more corrupt and exploitative, and the people once again became upset, until there was yet another usurping. This pattern would continue for a thousand years, and the situation for all other lands in the area was the same. 

Would you like living in the libertarian utopia?

"The Unvaccinated Need Education Not Coercion People who are unvaccinated are not unvaccinated because they are selfish, evil and want to hurt nor are all of them stupid. Many unvaccinated people are simply misinformed and have concerns about the vaccine. Like any other medical procedure, it's not unreasonable to want clarity that what you are putting in your body is safe.

Each unvaccinated person is different and has different reasons for refusing the vaccine. Some of these reasons are totally understandable. I can't blame Aboriginal Australians for not wanting the vaccine given horrific atrocities committed against them by the Australian government. Not wanting the vaccine because someone you know had a bad reaction is also understandable.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the unvaccinated would be open to getting the vaccine if their concerns were addressed. To those who argue that the unvaccinated 'can't be reasoned with', maybe the reason they weren't listening to you is because you were insulting them and acting in a condescending way.

Also to note, disadvantaged communities such as low income, POC and immigrants have lower vaccination rates and worse health outcomes in general. These groups often struggle more with accessing correct information and have less contact with healthcare professionals.

Also, calling someone stupid for being misinformed isn't productive. It doesn't achieve anything other than making them not listen to you. What you should do is present them with the correct information in a calm, intelligent and non condescending manner. They aren't nessecerily stupid, they are misinformed.

Treat it like sex ed. We don't get angry at a teenager who is misinformed about sex? We give them the right information. We don't call them stupid and refuse to explain things. When a pregnant woman is making a decision that could negatively affect her child, we counsel and educate that women and we ask her why she is making the harmful decision and her concerns.

It would be a good idea to invite these people to seminars where they can ask questions about the vaccine without being judged. Have people they trust and can relate to such as community leaders promote the vaccine instead of untrustworthy politicians and burocrats and elitist celebrities.

The person promoting vaccination should also not have any known political affiliation. These people are open to getting vaccinated. They just need assurance and the right information. Coercion on the other hand is both unethical and counterproductive.

Coercion is a violation of civil liberties and sets a bad precedent which will affect other bodily autonomy issues such as the right to abortion, the autonomy of pregnant women, blood donation, organ donation and forced psychiatry. It also makes people feel violated and this causes distrust in doctors and the medical system which leads to poorer long term health outcomes.",Conservative
"Some folks were saying this place used to be Libertarian but the mods allowed it to be taken over by non libertarians but a key aspect of Libertarianism is free speech so technically speaking banning those who didn't represent Libertarian views would go counter to the views of Libertarianism. Idk, it's just a random thing I noticed. My personal opinion on this claim is that Libertarianism has multiple forms. Right wing, left wing and probably anarchism to some extend, each differ in their own ways and all have different approaches on I guess to achieve true libertarianism. 

I'm pretty ok with having a wilder range of variety but it seems like this might be an issue for some folks which is pretty understandable. 

From what I've seen in the posts on this place the content seems to be pretty Libertarian but with just enough variety in our views that it doesn't just become a circlejerk. 

We discuss, we argue and we don't always disagree and that's ok. Even if this were to be a specific type of Libertarian sub only the mods would only end up being massive hypocrites if they ended up banning folks who didn't align with their view of Libertarianism. 

One of the core beliefs of Libertarianism stops the mods from banning folks (unless they blatantly break reddit's rules) 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think this place has a variety or not and do you think that's a good or bad thing. 

My personal beliefs in politics is that while I may disagree with many folks and agree with others from both sides on certain matters it's never wise to get angry at what other people believe in. They're entitled to their own beliefs as am I.",Conservative

The decision on how to use and distribute that property is usually decided by the leaders of the worker collective, but can sometimes be put to a majority vote where minority voices will be excluded entirely. Typically, leaders convince a majority to vote for them by inducing feelings of envy and frustration in the public and using conspiracy theories to scapegoat minorities as the root cause of the majority's problems. 

Socialism has lead to the deaths of many millions of its own citizens. Specifically:

* Ideological collectivist economic projects that resulted in the starvation of millions
* Elimination of different political or religious populations through political purges 

&#x200B;

**Key Characteristics of Socialism**

* Collective rights above Individual rights - illiberal
* Scapegoating minorities - populist
* Propensity to use force and violence - oppressive
* The state was unopposed with a high degree of political and economic power - authoritarian
   * Socialism is against political pluralism
* Has a system of beliefs about collective justice - ideological
* Mystical beliefs about the collective being 'the chosen people' - unreason 
   * eg, the proletariat will one day rise up and take their rightful place (Karl Popper)",Conservative

"Being anti-state pro-market and pro-capitalist is a contradiction Either you can be pro-state, pro-capitalist and pro-market or you can be anti-state, and anti-capitalist, and then either pro or anti market. This is because capitalism is statism by definition, since an ""Anarcho-Capitalist"" society will rule its people in the same way that a current state rules over them, except that (in the same way as some government services e.g. Court Custody facilities, Court and Prison Escort Services, Private Prisons, Private Police, parts of the NHS (National Health Service), etc, in the United Kingdom) all government services will be run by private corporations. 

How is this any different to a current state with the exception that you get to decide which corporation/company/individual that you fund to carry out a service or provide goods to you? To me it is the same thing.

What if you break company policy, which will effectively become the law?

"The richest 10% of the global population controls 76% of the world's wealth in 2021. By contrast, the bottom 50% owns a mere 2%. The middle 40%, meanwhile, owns 22%. Global billionaires last year enjoyed the steepest increase in their share of wealth since the World Inequality Lab began keeping records in 1995, according to the research group's analysis released Tuesday.     

At the same time, the pandemic pushed about 100 million people into extreme poverty, raising the global total to 711 million in 2021, according to a World Bank estimate cited by the analysis. 

When it comes to income, the top 10% captures 52% of global income, while the bottom 50% earns only 8%. The middle 40% makes 39%.

Latin America has the largest divide between the top 10%, which controls 77% of the wealth, and bottom 50%, which owns a scant 1%.

By contrast, Europe has the smallest gap.         The top 10% owns 58% of total wealth versus 4% for the bottom 50%.

The large number of public programs that are available to low-income and middle class residents -- including free education, health care and culture -- are among the reasons why Europe is a less unequal society.

"Beijing Biden’s DOJ Is Ending Trump National Security Initiative Protecting the US from China – Will Adjust Its Focus By Joe Hoft

Published February 24, 2022 at 7:00am

&#x200B;

The Biden team is hell-bent on destroying the USA. Not one thing that Biden has done since stealing the 2020 Election has been for America’s benefit, but all have helped China. Now Biden is being open about it.

President Trump initiated a program that would focus on and protect the US from China.  Now Biden is ending that program.  FOX News reports:

&#x200B;

The Department of Justice announced Wednesday that it is ending its “China Initiative” program that was aimed at preventing spying by the Chinese Communist Party, and launching a new, “broader approach.”

&#x200B;

The China Initiative was started in 2018 under the Trump administration to protect U.S. national security against Chinese spying on U.S. intellectual property and in academia. The DOJ website said it was aimed at “identifying and prosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage,” as well as “protecting our critical infrastructure against external threats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises.”

&#x200B;

That program is coming to an end. In its place, the DOJ is instituting a new “Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats.”

&#x200B;

“Our goal with this strategy is to take a comprehensive approach that draws on the full extent of our tools and authorities to address the alarming rise in illegal activity from hostile nations,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the DOJ’s National Security Division said. “This includes growing threats within the United States and to Americans and U.S. businesses abroad.”

&#x200B;

Olsen said “the current threat landscape demands a broader approach,” and cited not just China, but Iran, Russia, and North Korea.

&#x200B;

According to the article:

&#x200B;

A former Justice Department official lamented that the U.S. “stopped fighting for the China initiative on Jan 20, 2021,” the day President Biden took office.

&#x200B;

The former official told Fox News China was successful in framing the issue as one of racial bias, and that the U.S. stopped trying to counter this.

&#x200B;

“We gave up. You know the champagne corks will be popping at CCP offices. They won the disinformation campaign,” the former official said.

&#x200B;

This appears to be the truth.  Lawrence Sellin in exclusive reports at TGP has shared how China infiltrated US universities and biomedical research centers and through grants, training and education used the US to build its bioweapons military initiative that was likely behind the release of COVID in the country in 2019.  The US could have prevented this through actions to identify and then address Chinese infiltration in US universities and research centers.

&#x200B;

We also see this week that a company in Alabama has to shut down due to Biden’s actions in lifting the Trump tariffs with China.

&#x200B;

A Huntsville, Alabama, solar panel factory will close after President Joe Biden exempted foreign-made bifacial solar panels from United States tariffs earlier this month.

&#x200B;

LG Electronics, a South Korea-based company, announced that it will be closing its Huntsville solar panel manufacturing operation, resulting in the layoffs of about 160 American employees and another 60 Americans who are employed as contract workers.

&#x200B;

China is happy and that makes Biden/Obama happy.",Conservative
American Economy and the End of Laissez-Faire - 4 of 13 - The Rise and Fall of Monopolie ,Conservative
"And here in the US, the combined wealth of our 745 billionaires has increased by over $2 trillion since the pandemic began. A small annual wealth tax on the world's wealthiest billionaires and multi-millionaires could raise over $2.5 trillion each year. (That's based on a graduated rate structure of a 2% tax on wealth over $5 million, 3% on wealth over $50 million, and 5% on wealth over $1 billion.)

This is enough revenue to lift 2.3 billion people out of poverty, vaccinate the entire world, and deliver universal health care and social protection for all citizens of low and lower-middle-income countries — an estimated 3.6 billion people. Here in the United States, a tax like that could raise nearly $930 billion a year. And with a more progressive rate structure — say, a 10% rate on wealth over $1 billion — it could raise over $1 trillion. Numbers like that could put us on the path to universal health care, a decarbonized economy, and much more.

n October, Senator Ron Wyden put forward a proposal to tax the unrealized capital gains of the country's billionaires and those with income of at least $100 million for three years in a row. It would generate an estimated $557 billion over 10 years, according to congressional tax scorers.

I've looked through plenty of sites, and this information seems non-existent. I've tried open-secrets, Five-Thirty-Eight, GovTrack, etc and they have tons of studies on ideology, but no hard numbers.

The reason I'm trying to find this is that I read an article that Sens Hawley and Cotton voted to approve $1 trillion more than Sens Sanders and Warren. I'd like to compare them to other Senators, like Rand, to see how they actually vote vs their rhetoric about being for small government.

I just find it interesting just how hard it is to find out how Washington is spending our money. You'd think this would be more widely available than football stats.",Conservative

"I’m romanian, here is what communism did to us After WW2 the russian army remained on our country and frauded elections for the Romanian communist party to win. People used to have lands, businesses, but they lost everything due to privatisation and collectivism. In the 70-80, we were prosperous after we contracted loans from international banks, but the communist leader Ceausescu visited China and liked what he saw. He wanted to be idolised, he wanted big parades in his honour, his picture in every classroom, in every office. But suddenly he didn’t want to “be a slave” for world banks, so he wanted to pay all the debts. He managed to do so, by cutting out how water in households (not only for washing, but for heating also), people were starving because there was literally nothing to eat other than the “ratio” you were provided. 
How is everything now? Horrible. Our grandparents miss that period, because they had job security (nevermind the fact that no matter how safe your job was, there was basically nothing you could do with money). People still expect the government to do everything for them, because that how it was. You finished high school and were given a job, an apartment and vacation, people still expect that, there is little entrepreneurial spirit in my country, people are lazy, they are happy to just live another day, to live pay check to pay check, there is no pursuit for something greater.

The state is forcing you to stay and fight even if you don't beleive in their reasons to fight. If the US invaded cuba do you think the cuban government should have the right to force their citizens to stay and fight? That's ideally the same situation with Ukraine, yet so many people on this sub would call those people who don't want to fight cowards. They're just trying to re-direct the conversation because they know that they don't actually have any real libertarian values in the most important instances where your life is on the line.

"ELI5: How can privately held wealth not lead to strong, centralized power? Coming here since I consider myself a left-libertarian and y'all have different views that I'd like to expose myself to.

I view history as a series of civilizations with increased levels of centralized power: tribes -> duchies- > nation states. I see these forming from claims to land, protected by private armies, which are made possible only through the wealth of a person/group of people who fund the armies. Resources extracted from the claimed land further empower the central authority, be it a chieftain, a royal family, or a federal government. Wealth equates to power, as greater wealth allows one to acquire more goods and services. 

Capital begets capital, something we see happening today and something that was apparent in Pinochet's Chile, arguably the most free-market-friendly government of the 20th century. And it's undeniable that the wealthiest Americans exercise enormous power over our political system by financing campaigns. In an ancap society, what are the checks on the power that capital gives? What is to stop the wealthiest from hiring their own private armies and staking territorial claims? Were prehistoric societies not ancap societies, which ultimately led to increasingly large centralized authorities?

"OUTRAGEOUS! Liz Cheney’s Jan. 6 Committee Subpoenaed Phone Records of Mother of Owen Shroyer – Who Works with Alex Jones and WHO NEVER ENTERED US CAPITOL By Jim Hoft

Published February 28, 2022 at 9:00am

&#x200B;

In August 2021, the FBI issued an arrest warrant for Infowars host Owen Shroyer for being on the Capitol Steps along with around 1,000 other Americans on January 6th.

&#x200B;

This is pure communism — a political attack on a prominent conservative voice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Owen made the announcement during a live broadcast of his show The War Room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The corrupt FBI charged Owen for peacefully standing on the Capitol Steps along with about 1,000 other Americans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Owen Shroyer was with Alex Jones that day. We sat next to Owen and Alex at the Ellipse during President Trump’s speech. Alex later used a bullhorn to tell Trump supporters NOT to go into the US Capitol.

&#x200B;

On Monday news broke that Liz Cheney’s Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the phone records from Owen’s mother.

&#x200B;

How is this any different than Soviet Russia?

&#x200B;

The Daily Mail reported:

&#x200B;

The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol has subpoenaed the phone records of a mother whose son works for right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones as the panel tries to understand the Infowars host’s role before the riots.

&#x200B;

Court documents filed on Sunday show the committee has subpoenaed records for Annette Shroyer, the mother of Jones employee Owen Shroyer, who was charged with breaching the Capitol Hill grounds during the riots last year.

&#x200B;

Annette Shroyer has accused the panel of abusing its powers and asked a judge to let her join Jones’ pending lawsuit against the committee, reports Politico. Jones sued the House committee in December last year in an effort to block the subpoenas he’d been issued.

&#x200B;

The mother received notice of the subpoena on February 10 and Verizon has indicated it would provide Annette Shroyer’s phone records unless she filed a suit by February 28. The select committee declined to comment.

&#x200B;

The FBI and their Democrat overlords are the modern-day Stasi.

I think you could make an argument about not giving children pornography or graphic violence, but those are fringe cases. But even the banning of books like Maus or Hop on Pop, while I disagree with their choice to do so, is a choice I think they should have. The appropriate response is to speak with the schools, explain why you disagree, and try to change their policy. Which, for the record, many people actually do. You can also just give your kids these books; heck, give 'em to other kids too. If you think the ban is egregious enough, you should have the power to change schools, or homeschool. If nothing else, the choice a school makes to ban books and which books is valuable information; it's sort of a canary in a coal mine.

"""Anarcho-Capitalism Is Real Anarchism"" by Cosmosaic  ""I’m almost looking forward to the scoffing responses from any Leftists who happen to read this one. Any “true” Anarchist surely knows that Capitalism cannot co-exist with Anarchism, right? For, Capitalism and their Overlords (capital O) are the ones the Anarchists are rebelling against! But I beg to differ. The reason being that true Anarchism needs to be based on Individualism rather than Collectivism. Why is this you ask? Because Collectivism automatically will lead to some kind of function of a State, and Anarchism by nature is a society without a State.

Private Property owners are not a State. A Government is a State. A Government is unique in that it has a Monopoly on coercion through physical force. If they didn’t, then you could just choose to not pay your Taxes with no penalty. Wal Mart on the other hand, the biggest corporation in the world, has no Monopoly on coercing you through physical force to buy their products, or to work there. You can just choose to not have Wal Mart be a part of your life, with no punishment. That’s Voluntarism.

In a Collectivist attempt or approach to Anarchism, you hypothetically have no State and everyone is just collectively working together in a unified Socialist/Communist community of harmony and bliss. That is, until someone steps out of line.

Suddenly, someone comes along one day that doesn’t want to dance the Socialist dance anymore. Instead, he’s been reading Murray Rothbard and thinking, and has decided that he wants to start his own business. By himself. Without input from the community, and with his own resources and money. He decides to share this notion with one close friend to get a better sense if he wants to go solo or start a partnership, and in the meantime gets to work to get his small business running on the edge of town, using the funds of his basic income to do so. The friend decides to leak this news to others. Word of mouth spreads the news throughout the community.

Outraged, a shadow overcomes the blissful harmonic Anarchist community. Nobody agrees with or likes this Outcast. This Traitor. Something will need to be done about this person. How selfish of him to think that he can have his own privately run business in this Collectivist community where we are all sharing and helping each other in this giant group-hug of harmony and bliss! How DARE this person be so selfish and want to strike out on his own venture, using public money for himself?!

Not that it will matter. He will be shut down. Because in our community, there is no private property, or private profit. We are all in this together. And if he doesn’t shut down, then things will have to get physical. We will all make sure of that. Because Capitalism is not allowed here in any form. We are Anarchist.

But, we assure you, this is a STATELESS society.

Many miles away, there’s another town, known as Ancapistan, and they base their community on Individualism and Voluntarism. There is no Government here. Each person represents, governs and rules themselves and their own body, beliefs, and pursuits, and voluntarily trades with other individuals. Private property is honored here. Private businesses abound, and occasionally greedy Monopolies emerge which try to corner a specific market, but since there is so much competition, their greed puts them out of business unless they adapt to the prices and services of their competitors.

Some people are overwhelmed by so much Capitalism, and so a handful of people start reading Karl Marx and decide they would rather start their own Communes on the edge of town. Their fellow Libertarians catch wind of this, shrug and say “have fun, just do not attempt to overthrow this town with your Commie crap! If you attempt to seize our private businesses, we will defend ourselves.”

A few Libertarians even get intrigued enough to pop in and out of these Communes at their own will. Some decide to hang out there for good, while others get tired of the Collectivist approach and leave at their own leisure.

Any Fascist authoritarian personalities who disapprove of this Communist attitude in an otherwise Libertarian society will just have to put up with it. If they attempt to shut down the Communes, they’re on their own, and the Commies have every right to defend themselves, and convince others to join in helping, although nobody has to.

In this society, the Non-Aggression Principle is the only Law, which states that the only justified form of violence is self-defense. Otherwise, each person is free to live as they choose. ‘Do what thou wilt’.

So what is the difference between these two societies? The difference is that if you go against the Collectivist/Socialist grain, you’re ganged up on, and will be forced to fall back in line or you will be thrown out, or worse. Physical force will ensue if necessary.

If you go against the Individualist/Libertarian grain, you are free to do so, so long as you do not impose your way of life and beliefs on other individuals without their consent. If you do, then they have the right to defend themselves with physical force if necessary.

# The first society will gang up on you with physical force if necessary for practicing Capitalism. The second society will not gang up on those practicing Communism, but will defend themselves from aggression from the Communists if necessary.

## One society will violently overthrow Capitalists, while the other will merely self-defend from imposed violence from Communists.

## Therefore, Anarcho-Capitalism is the truly Stateless society, since it does not hold a Monopoly on coercion through physical force, also known as a State.""",Conservative

"Is capitalism based partly off of ‘I’m better than you, I figured ‘it’ out’ so now I’m more worthy than you to live a life of security’? This is a complicated reality we live in. Background on me: grew up in an upper middle class household, had opportunities presented to me to grow intellectually, socially, and economically that were gate-kept through the ability to afford these privileges - essentially thank you to my parents, I had nothing to do with the exposure I had until I, like many of us eventually do, gained some free will and re-evaluated all that was my life up until this self reflecting convo.

The kicker to all of this is, no one grows up with any innate understanding on how to own and operate a business - it’s a learned skill. Skills require time and resources to pursue. Time and resources are the windfall of having a decent paying job. A decent paying job used to be the norm for most industries (factory worker and janitors affording all they need to for them and their families, as it should be). Now it seems like the regular capitalists look back at what they ‘figured out’ and seem to forget the entire society and family aspect of how they got to where they are at today. Presumably this is why high net worth individuals typically donate their money - there will always be a small few like Cuban that understand money is a facilitator to change and act for the good of many. But capital hoarding is a serious problem for a society with millions of people on the brink.

So I ask, why does it seem like the modern capitalists fail to understand that what they figured out was afforded to them by more than just themselves? Why does it feel like our system is happy with having so many of its citizens concerned for their next rent payment? How could these people be expected to want to adapt to a system that doesn’t appreciate their labor enough to create a living wage? 

I really want to have a dialogue about this - our country is only a generation or two away from collapsing because of the expanding consciousness of the obviously wage slaved members that fundamentally keep this system afloat

Confusing times we live in but having empathy beyond your house is important.

Tell me what you all think! How can this be understood and improved?

They are unwilling to impose regulations which could make it fairer for the lower income percentages which represent a majority. They only want to gift lower taxes which they say drives innovation for which those that produce those same innovations see little benefit. Working class hero’s!

Capitalism is a fatally flawed system. It’s cloaked in the myth that anyone can make it here. It’s artificially merit based. Value is arbitrary.

This week, unprecedented sanctions in human history is made against Russia and the Russian people. I don't say we should not punish Russian government.

In a libertarian point of view, sanctions are against some kind of freedom.

"Libertarian or not: Creating peace for yourself for your home, goes a long way when it comes to having peace with other people. When you learn to create peace for yourself, in your home I believe your worldview changes and at the very least. You won't disrupt it for others. 

I think a lot of socioeconomical/political discourse especially left vs right comes down to improperly channeled frustration.

Once when I was in Oklahoma City on my way to get Ramen, I saw 2 men who were holding hands confronted by a 3rd random man who wasn't with them, they never really stopped walking but words were exchanged back and forth and they ultimately passed each other by.

While I was eating my ramen I got to thinking... that man can't be that upset just about 2 gay men holding hands that he went from having a good life/day to screaming and yelling obscenities at them. 

This wasn't a Jewish person who saw a neo nazi or a black man who say some kkk... just 2 dudes walking down the street holding hands. Harmless.

Then it hit me. Improperly vented frustration,depression, anger will just manifest itself in terrible ways. We all see/hear things we don't like throughout our days, but we mostly ignore it when it's harmless to anyone to mind your business. And minding your business is a core libertarian principle.

TL:DR

Create peace for yourself and mind your business if you want to have and receive peace from others.",Conservative

"Socialist in r/socialist do support and believe in existing socialist governments... The link at the bottom is for a post in r/socialism where a user tells everyone they should be supporting existing socialist governments.

Socialism is not a philosophy. Socialism is an Anti Philosophy full of many contradictions. What does it even mean that the workers own and control the means of production? Which workers and to what extend and which means of production? Who actually is in charge of making all the decisions if everyone controls everything...? A real libertarian knows that when everyone owns and controls everything than no one owns or controls anything... Hence why you end up with some asshole who controls everything and everyone under the guise for the sake of the greater good or for the workers in socialist countries...

The socialist believe in destroying capitalism, and destroying fascism and all counter revolutionaries. Marx talk about a ""bloody revolution"". Neo Liberals also get put in front of the firing squad so dont think that just because you're a watered down leftist you'll avoid it.  There is a reason why right wingers believe in gun rights. 

The means to destroying capitalism is vanguardism. Vanguardism is when a left wing government takes control of everything and everyone. And is used to socialize the economy and nationalize everything and destroy all opposition. Thats the first stage of socialism. Thats dictatorship of the proletarian. Thats the excuse they use for why people should support China, Laos, Cuba and even North Korea.  And if you dont support these governments well than you are just brain wash by ""The red scare"" Anti Communist US propaganda... 

I read a lot of post about socialism on the internet. And its not always the case that they are this honest. Thats why I took the time to link it. 

I think the difference between a socialist libertarian and a socialist is that socialist libertarian might not actually believe in vanguardism.

"Basic capitalism tutorial for some of the USA Alright, if by some chance someone needed a little help to benefit off of capitalism.

Lets over generalize and say there's two types of people in the USA.

&#x200B;

People whose choose failure regardless on if they have the solution(s) and materials needed to pull off that solution.

&#x200B;

The second group not wanting failure but are open to solutions brought up. They basically already are living to an extent but aren't sure how to optimize everything so that their margin of errors are far less thin.

&#x200B;

Lets say you're the second group who maybe are a socialist or whatever have you, and you actually want to benefit more off of capitalism but aren't sure how. Either because somebody called ya an idiot or your peers peer pressure you into doubling down on questionable behaviors.

(I believe there was a study that did that. They had a test subject in a class room and if the entire control group were to consistently get the wrong answer, the one test subject would fall in line eventually, but that aside)

&#x200B;

First off some disclaimers. This will not work (or at least, not as well as alternative areas) in all territories/states of the USA. New York, California, CHAZ is an immediate no no, and just in general, deep blue city centered states.

&#x200B;

Second disclaimer, this is assuming you have no weirdly specific allergies. So Soy won't cause problems, no allergies against wheat, rice protein, no weird veganism elitism where if it is easy it isn't real veganism, you're a omnivore so you can eat as needed, etc.

You got two arms, two legs. Basically you're as ""normal"" as normal as can be.

&#x200B;

Finally, this ideally works best if you have a smartphone (Apple or Android is fine). A computer with a reasonable internet would work too.

&#x200B;

Okay ready? Lets do this.

&#x200B;

To make things simple and more easily graspable, lets say there's three pillars of the individual's responsibilities in the USA.

These three pillars are as follows (Note: In no particular order of importance),

Financials, Physical Ability/Abilities, and Intelligence.

&#x200B;

We're gonna start with the Financial Pillar first so we can fund your other Pillars effectively later on.

&#x200B;

Firstly, go to the App-Store/Google-Play.

Look up a financial budgeting app that's free called ""EveryDollar"". Imo the paid subscription for the ""premium"" features is mediocre, so stick with the free version.

I recommend this app as it is straightforward/clear to use. No need to get an app that's overly complicated. So stick with simple for now.

EveryDollar exists on PC as well. Data carries over between both mobile and PC versions.

&#x200B;

Set up your account in EveryDollar.

Once that's done, pick a month to ""start"". Ideally you want to use your soon to be made financial budget plan for a entire month, not have it start midway into a current month.

&#x200B;

Lets say for example its December 2021 and in a week it will be January 2022.

Make your budget for January 2022, not December.

This is because starting out, your current goal should be to see where your money is going to start with before we start dialing back certain bas financial behaviors.

&#x200B;

After picking a month to make a budget for.

Go to income and estimate how much you make per pay check.

For example, lets say its a month with 4 pay days in it. Lets say its Friday.

You make individual entries for each Friday.

&#x200B;

When you do get that paycheck, go into that entry of the relevant Friday, enter the amount, and adjust the ""planned amount"" to reflect the actual amount you've gotten.

&#x200B;

The reason you don't wait for the real values to show up is basically so we have numbers to work with to begin with.

&#x200B;

After entering your (estimated) income for the 4 individual Friday's, it will say something along the lines of ""you have this much money left to budget"". Ignore that for now.

&#x200B;

Go to the Housing category and add a entry called ""Apartment Rent"". (Assuming you're renting)

Enter the total amount you pay in rent for a month.

If electricity and water are not included in your went, under that same Housing category, you can make a ""PG&E"" Entry and put in a estimate of how much you pay for those things per month.

&#x200B;

Next up, under a category (it can be ""Health"" if you want), make entries for the estimated amounts you pay in insurance per month.

Renters' Insurance, Earthquake Insurance (if that's relevant to your area), COBRA Health Insurance, etc.

&#x200B;

Now under a category (it can also be under ""Health"" if you'd like), make entries for each reoccurring supplies you buy (per month).

Things like vasaline, body wash, toothbrushes, general supplies like that, that you use.

&#x200B;

Next up, under the ""Food"" category, make entries that are relevant to you.

For example, if you get your food from Walmart, say ""Walmart Food"", if its from Amazon, ""Food ordered from Amazon"", ""Restaurant food and drinks, ""Snacks"", ""Alcohol"", etc.

Put in the estimated respective amounts.

However, beef those numbers up as this category, people tend to on average pay more than they'd expect. So estimate the costs to be higher than what you're currently thinking.

&#x200B;

Under the ""Transportation"" category, put in your estimated costs that are relevant to you. Gas, Bus Fare, BART Fare, etc.

&#x200B;

Do these things with any major cost you need to spend money on that I more than likely forgot to mention in this lengthy post.

&#x200B;

After you've gotten done with all of that, the ""you have so and so amount of money left to spend"" will show you how much money you actually have for wants. Things you don't need, or how much money you actually have left to save into an account, etc.

Your ""liquid money"" so to speak.

If it says something like ""so and so amount OVER BUDGET"" that indicates that there's a financial issue with one of your habits.

&#x200B;

Now that you have a birds eye view of your take home income post costs, you can zero in on issues to dial back certain bad habits.

Like spending too much at Starbucks.

Maybe you need to buy less expensive toothbrushes, etc.

&#x200B;

After you've unfucked your budget to live within your means and stop acting like your resources are infinite, its time for the next phase of unfucking up your life.

&#x200B;

Also another disclaimer I've forgotten to mention at the start. On average, your peers will hate you for improving yourself. That's more than likely because the average person has two options, acknowledge that you're a hard worker, and then subconsciously acknowledge that they chose not to be one, or discount your hard work by being dismissive, toxic, etc. So that they can avoid the former option.

&#x200B;

As long as they're not trying to physically injure you, yes it will hurt emotionally in the short term, but just ignore them.

Odds are they're in a means to do better than you but aren't responsible with their resources, hence why they may be very likely in debt and are in denial that its their fault.

&#x200B;

Just because they (may) earn more than you doesn't mean they can't be in debt.

Like AOC lol.

&#x200B;

To make yourself feel better temporarily to brush off their bullshit, here's what you can do.

Think of manure. Doesn't matter what kind.

Farmers and other individuals may buy manure via money.

&#x200B;

This means manure has a net worth of sorts.

&#x200B;

A person in debt has a negative net worth.

Which means they're financially speaking, literally less than a bag of shit.

&#x200B;

So don't take it to hard if they're attacking you with silly insults. Again ignore them, they literally aren't worth it.

&#x200B;

That side talk side, back to the plan.

For this next step, go to the ""Savings"" category and make a category called ""Cushion"".

&#x200B;

Click on the entry and turn it into a Fund.

What this does is, any money not spent within this entry will carry over into next month's budget.

For example, if there's $350.00 in the Cushion and you spent $50.00 of it, going into next month's budget in February, the Cushion entry will have a balance of $300.00.

&#x200B;

That explanation aside, what the Cushion entry is gonna be used for is as follows.

&#x200B;

Allow you to handle miscellaneous expenses such as a surprise visit to a birthday party.

&#x200B;

You've accidentally went over budget in a category. This is important because the cushion prevents other entries from needing to be cannibalized to compensate.

&#x200B;

Your pay estimation was a few dollars off.

And so on.

&#x200B;

Your ""Planned Amount"" for your Cushion does all of this. Your ""Planned Amount"" is a ""Soft Cushion"".

This should ideally be $150.00 - $350.00 or a little higher or lower depending on many factors such as your living situation's stability, if you're consistent per month with how you spend money (both negatively and positively),

if you're frugal or not, etc.

Use your best guess, as you can get it to be more accurate in future months. Your very first EveryDollar budget is basically just a information gathering month anyways so if this first budget ends up being a wash, you know what to improve on going into the next month.

&#x200B;

""Was the Soft-Cushion (Planned Amount in Cushion entry) too low?"".

""Did I spend too much at Chick-Fil-a?"".

""Did I not budget enough money to cover this month's PG&E bill(s)?"", etc.

&#x200B;

Next is the ""Hard Cushion"".

This is your ""Remaining Balance"" of your Cushion entry going into the next month's budget.

This is extremely important,

this will be how much money you have to start with going into the start of next month.

&#x200B;

So to ""make"" a Hard Cushion, here's what you do.

Figure out how much you spend on transportation or whatever to make it through a typical work week. Including costs of coffee, lunch, etc.

&#x200B;

For your ""Planned Amount"" under the Cushion Entry, add this value you've just figured out on top of the $150.00 - $350.00 that's already there.

For example, if the Soft Cushion was $350.00, and your costs for one work week is $300.00, the Cushion entry's ""Planned Amount"" should now be $650.00.

&#x200B;

Leave that extra $300.00 (or whatever amount you end up rounding up to) alone.

Going into the next month budget, it will say that your Cushion entry's balance will be $300.00.

So you'll have $300.00 in your Checkings Account at the start of said month.

&#x200B;

THIS IS SEPARATE FROM YOUR

Soft Cushion.

So if you're Soft Cushion is under funded, DO NOT cannibalize off of that $300.00 preexisting Balance in said month.

&#x200B;

You can also upgrade your Hard Cushion to be higher if you'd like to pay off rent at the very beginning of the month and still have money to pay for your work week costs as an example.

Its fairly flexible so use your best judgement on how big of a Hard Cushion you want to kick off a month with in your Checkings Account.

&#x200B;

Do note that the Hard Cushion is something you only really have to set up once. After you get the amount you want, you just leave that amount in your budget Balance for the Cushion entry alone and it will automatically carry over into future budgets.

&#x200B;

Another reason why the Hard Cushion is a mandatory thing to do is because what EveryDollar is, is a ""Zero-based budget""ing app. Basically, money utilized = income. So post costs, post putting money into a savings bank account, would result in your Checkings account equally $0.00 at the start of a new month.

&#x200B;

Not counting things you're saving up for.

Speaking of which, next up isn't really part if a plan, its a tool you can use to get things you want responsibly without getting into debt as virtue of being patient, and realistic with how much money you actually have/gain per month.

&#x200B;

This tool is a concept called a ""Sink Fund"".

Here's how it works via a example.

Lets say you want to buy a Sony Xperia 10 mk.iii smartphone.

Lets say the price for a new one is $480.00.

&#x200B;

Go under the ""Personal"" category and make a entry for the Sony Xperia 10 mk.iii. Make that entry a Fund the same way you did with the Cushion entry.

&#x200B;

Now figure out what's the most reasonable amount of time you want one relative to the amount needed to be saved.

Lets say you want it in Christmas as a treat for yourself.

&#x200B;

Assuming we're still on January's budget.

Divide the price of the item you want by the amount of months of that length of time it would take to save up for one.

In this case until December.

So $480.00 divided by 12 months.

You'd get $40.00.

&#x200B;

This value means you'd ideally want to save $40.00 PER MONTH. By December, the amount you will have saved up in your Checkings Account will be $480.00. Enough to get the item you've wanted (not counting misc. things like screen protectors, taxes, etc. I just wanted to give a simple explanation as to what a Sink Fund can do, let alone what it is to begin with).

&#x200B;

So in other words, even if your Hard Cushion is $300.00, it might look like you have more in the Checkings account due to things like Sink Funds happening in the background.

So don't look at that extra amount as an excuse to spend more.

&#x200B;

Sink funds can be used for other things to.

For example, lets say you have Earthquake's Insurance and instead of paying monthly, you opt to pay the insurance company via an annual plan.

Divide that amount by the amount of months between now and the next time you get charged.

&#x200B;

Now you can save up so that when its time to pay up for multiple things at a time, you know damn well you have the money to do so.

&#x200B;

Sink Funds can also be used to save up for things like Christmas Presents for your Squad, saving up for a smartphone upgrade AHEAD OF TIME so when you eventually do upgrade, you already have money set aside for it, etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now that we've gotten the basics of your financial foundation settled and cemented, its time to work on the real plan.

Actual step 1 is, under the ""Savings"" category, there should already be a category called ""Emergency Fund"".

&#x200B;

It should already be a Fund but if it isn't, turn that entry into one the same way you did with the Cushion entry from earlier.

&#x200B;

Now here's your first real mission.

Save up $1,000.00 as fast as YOU can into the Emergency Fund.

&#x200B;

If for example the maximum theoretical amount you could get is $300.00 per month but you emotionally need certain things, like hanging out with friends, going to the occasional restaurant, possibly both.

And say your amount you can save per month for the Emergency Fund is now only $150.00.

If it is emotionally sustainable, do it.

You can have your cake and eat it.

Just make sure that cake doesn't make you go over budget for the month and you'll be okay.

&#x200B;

That aside, once you've figured out the amount you can REALISTICALLY get, taking the financial costs of fun into account from keeping you from losing it with this current administration (and people in general lol), keep at it.

Do not reinvent the wheel.

If it works and its SUSTAINABLE, you don't need to modify the plan you got for the next months too much. Just be consistent(ish) and you'll get there.

&#x200B;

Patience is key. Again, if people are scolding you for doing and saving for things like Emergency Funds, brush it off. They're not responsible adults and don't want to be responsible adults either. So don't give in to the bad peer pressure from people with the awfully large egos relative to what they (don't) have.

&#x200B;

For example, that one chronically homeless guy who had all the help in the world, then spent it all on gambling and alcohol. Along with burning the bridges with the people that were trying to help him.

&#x200B;

Remember this and remember this well, some people DON'T want to change for the better (like exercising) or be saved, and make it everyone else's problem.

&#x200B;

Anyways, after dealing with the emotional plus physical external and internal turmoil of this entire process of people choosing to be lame to protect their egos and you doing your best not to smack them across the room, you'll have $1,000.00 in your Emergency Fund.

&#x200B;

If we use gaming logic, this Emergency Fund is your Health Bar. Your Soft Cushion are your Shields/Mana.

Having no Emergency Fund means the smallest inconvenience fucking murders you just by gently grazing you.

&#x200B;

This starter Emergency Fund is there to make sure you don't need to cash out a 401(k), take out a loan, use, credit, for this next step.

&#x200B;

For real step #2, we're gonna do what's called a Debt snowball.

Under the ""Debt"" category, enter entries down for each of your debts from smallest to largest REGARDLESS of interest rates.

The Debt Snowball is famous for being slow but a emotionally reliable way of paying off your debts without dying of a heart attack from stress.

&#x200B;

Again, if people are shitting on you for doing this, remember, they're literally more worthless than a bag of shit so ignore them to the best of your current abilities.

&#x200B;

That aside, after you have your debts. Its time for the next part of real step #2.

&#x200B;

For your smallest debt, pay it off as soon as possible.

&#x200B;

After that one is done, make minimum payments on the second smallest debt, etc.

&#x200B;

Its slow, its boring, but it works.

&#x200B;

After getting debt free, its time for real step #3.

Getting a FULLY FUNDED Emergency Fund of 3 to 6 months of expenses.

For most people its $12,000.00.

Figure out your amount that is 3-6 months worth if expenses for yourself and then we can continue.

&#x200B;

Got your value? Alright, lets begin real step #3.

Its literally just everything we've been doing before with real step #1 and Sink Funds.

Be reasonable so you can sustain your momentum.

&#x200B;

Relatively straight forward and boring step.

You can save a bit more aggressively if you'd like for this step but again, be reasonable.

Moderation in everything.

Work, saving, fun, you name it.

&#x200B;

After very tediously saving and fully funding your 3-6 months big Emergency Fund, its time to do real step #4.

&#x200B;

Go to a bookstore or Amazon, whatever, so long as they have it.

Buy a book called

""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"" by John C. Bogle.

&#x200B;

Its basically a book hard core backing up the idea that low cost Index Funds are the way to go in the investing world in terms of reliable. Its a bit redundant but it really proves its point.

&#x200B;

Make a Sink Fund to buy it physically if you need to.

&#x200B;

After reading it, its time for real step #5.

Take your newfound (additional) knowledge of index funds and apply them to your 401(k). After setting up which index funds you've chosen to invest in. Invest 15% of your income into your 401(k). No more, no less.

&#x200B;

There's a trick to this to invest your 15% efficiently.

Invest into your 401(k) up to a match.

After that, invest the remainder of that 15% into a ROTH IRA. If it caps off, put the remainder of that 15% back into the traditional 401(k).

&#x200B;

HOWEVER. If your company has something called a ROTH 401(k), you can effectively just dump the entire 15% into there.

&#x200B;

Now leave that retirement fund alone along with the investment value of 15% of your income.

Any less than makes compound interest significantly less effective very quickly.

Any more than 15% of your income will make it impressively impossible to live in the present.

&#x200B;

Again, its a case of, its sustainable, but not unreasonable in terms of profits.

Its, say it with me now,

sustainable.

&#x200B;

Now that you've done all of that, what you do now is up to you.

&#x200B;

However I do have additional miscellaneous tips for you before I go.

&#x200B;

MealSquares are a thing that exists. They're bought in bulks and they check out at about $3.00 per MealSquare.

They have everything necessary nutrition wise.

Vitamin A, B, C, D, calcium, protein, etc.

&#x200B;

So if you find yourself buying McDonalds chicken nuggets constantly, try substituting them for a month to try out MealSquares.

&#x200B;

Secondly tip, despite the stereotypes around it, Soylent is another good healthy food\*(people are still debating that label) that's relatively cheap with how normal people spend on restaurants.

A ready made drink of Soylent is a little under $3.00.

The make it yourself powdered version that you need to mix with water yourself is a little over $1.00 per meal.

&#x200B;

Third and final tip.

Use either Cash or Debit instead of Credit.

&#x200B;

The reasoning behind this is very simple.

The banks effectively sell you on a idea that causes you to spend more money without even realizing.

&#x200B;

This is because there's a visual aspect to it.

If I'm at a restaurant and pay in cash $100.00, I visually see Mr. Franklin's face parting from my hand. He's gone now.

&#x200B;

Take that same scenario but with a Debit Card.

I pay $100 but I visually see I am getting my card back. But my bank account immediately deducts the value out of my Checkings Account.

So I still ""see"" that I've just spent money.

&#x200B;

Credit Cards are toxic because visually, I get my card back, AND my Checkings Account doesn't deduct immediately.

&#x200B;

Another major reason they're detrimental to your financial health is with the concept of cash back.

The bank basically just sold you on the concept that ""if I spend money, I can save money"".

&#x200B;

It being a percentage means you subconsciously try to spend more so you ""save more"".

This also doubly manipulates you by seeming like you're getting free money. When in reality, the banks are banking on you to over spend by ""spending more to save more"", subconsciously manipulating you because it makes you seem richer than you actually are as you have no IMMEDIATE feedback that you've just spent any money.

&#x200B;

Also just think about the values for example.

Lets say 1.5% cash back.

If you spent $1,000.00 you get $15.00 back.

The alternative being not spending that $1,000.00 and put it into a Savings Account.

&#x200B;

With all that said, you should be gucci from here on out. If there's anything else you need, you now know how to pay for those needs

AND, your wants.

So from here on out its up to you what your next goal will be.

"I am sick of the black and white thinking on Ukraine. You can be critical of the western involvement in the revolution and still be against the invasion. This ""either the west is right or Russia"" really annoys me. The people who defend the invasion because of western and especially American meddling clearly don't understand what this war means to the population. This belief, that if one side is wrong that means the other side is right to me just means that the propaganda worked on them, because it takes all nuance out of the world.

And the way the far right and the authoritarian left agree on how Russia is in the right should be a warning sign to them. 

A friend of my brothers sent a video of an attack on the water power station he lives by, the helicopters so close you cannot be anything but scared for your life. Please let's reject imperialism no matter from what side.

Edit: it's also obviously a good idea to be critical of some of the intelligence about the matter, of course. The US doesn't have a great track record in that regard. But just because they both use propaganda doesn't mean you have to choose a side.

"My Progressive Diatribe Just a US citizen who has an armchair opinion about how a progressive society should be:

- Cut military budget in half. Currently (per Google) at $721.5b.
- Use part of that cost reduction to finance putting a social worker with every police officer. 
- Ban private prisons, flat. 
- Legalize drugs and prostitution, placing heavy regulation/taxation on both. 
- End Citizen’s United. 
- Pathway to citizenship, focus on transparency and timeliness. 
- Universal childcare/preschool. 
- Universal community college. 
- 100% tax break for businesses that fund employee higher education reimbursement (BA/BS and above).
- Trimester-based P-CC education, end summer gap. 
- Universal healthcare. 
- Universal senior care (visiting nurses, retirement homes, hospice).
- Pass death with dignity. 
- Increase government funding of science research to support ecological and environmental science. 
- Heavily regulate lobbying, removing private funding and introducing transparency requirements for all spending (no private equity). 
- End gerrymandering. 
- Election holiday. 
- And fuck it, Universal Basic Income.

You give me all of that, I give you a utopian society capable of unimaginable progressive achievement and societal balance. Who wouldn’t want to live in a society like that?

Anyone could open a small business overnight, minimal cost to start (no retirement, no healthcare, no unemployment). Everyone would move to a contract-based employment schema since workers would always have a safety net/minimal income to fall back on, with UHC and free education to support career change or illness. People would absolutely still strive to work, for additional income/status. Those who couldn’t would have basic needs covered - homelessness gone. 

Everyone would develop a lifelong learning skill set with free skill-based education. Businesses would absolutely encourage additional higher education with tax break incentives. With universal childcare and preschool kids would have continuous learning available for their entire lives, fueling innovation and employment supply for commerce. 

The cost of all that big government would be covered by a steady supply of healthy, highly educated and emotionally supported workers paying income taxes and businesses paying appropriately for their staff balanced by the cost savings of entitlements they now don’t have to pay for.

"Russian Communist Workers Party (RKWP-KPSS) ""We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the workers of Kazakhstan!""     
The Russian Communist Workers' Party (RKWP-KPSS) expresses class solidarity with the striking workers of Kazakhstan    
Statement of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the RKWP-CPSU    
The beginning of 2022 in Kazakhstan was marked by a workers' strike in the Mangistau region. The reason for the speech was a shock jump in gas prices - two times. And the real reasons are that the 30-year domination of capitalism in Kazakhstan has led to an enormous growth of social contradictions. The luxury of the elite is side by side with the poverty of the working masses. People are especially hated by the prosperity and reign of the Nazarbayev clan, the former secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, who turned from a comrade into a master and guarantor of the exploiting class    
The strikers' first demands were purely economic - lower gas prices for consumers, higher wages and better working conditions. A strike began in the workers' town of Zhanaozen, well-known to us and to the whole world, where in 2011 a many-month strike of oil workers took place, brutally suppressed by the authorities. The protesters were shot at. Dozens of workers were killed, hundreds were arrested and imprisoned. The RCWP, ROT FRONT and many communist and workers' parties of the world then expressed fraternal solidarity with the strikers, an angry protest against the inhuman reprisals, and carried out numerous support actions. Representatives of our party, with a real risk to their lives, went to the scene of the events, where they met with workers' leaders, handed over material support, and expressed a strong protest to the regional authorities.    
Events unfolded rapidly. Since the authorities as usual did not react in any way to the protests of workers, in just a few days the strike covered the entire region, and then escalated into mass unrest. The workers were supported by city dwellers, then workers in many regions of Kazakhstan went on strike in solidarity with their class brothers. The authorities indicated their readiness to make partial concessions. But the workers and the rising people were no longer satisfied with pitiful handouts from the master's shoulder. The authorities began to pull troops to large cities. And then the protesting masses of Kazakhstan literally revolted, already putting forward political demands for the resignation of the country's government and the departure from power of the hateful Nazarbayev clan.    
The authorities were really afraid of the strength of the united people, the president satisfied all the economic demands and sent the Government into resignation.    
However, one cannot calm down and celebrate victory. Power in the country remains in the hands of big business. The troops have not been returned to their places of permanent deployment. The enterprises are in the hands of the former owners. The authorities have already turned to their CSTO partners for help, who understand the danger of an example of a popular uprising for other republics. It should be understood that the bourgeoisie of Kazakhstan crossed the line already in 2011 by shooting the workers of Zhanaozen. Today they will probably stop at nothing. At the slightest opportunity, all the concessions snatched from the gentlemen will be taken back, repression will return with the same fury. Capital cannot exist without exploitation. Therefore, the workers need to organize themselves into class organizations and fight not for a change from one clan to another, but for their workers' power. The communists understand that these protests cannot do without the participation of other capitalist clans opposing the Nazarbayev family - the synchronization of the protests and the one-sided orientation of slogans was too obvious. It is no secret that for many years in the territory of the former Soviet republics various NGOs, funded by capital, have been working on the training of universal activists, incl. large foreign states. Activists have their own headquarters, finances, connections and at a certain moment they try to ride the protests and take them in the direction their owners need, reducing everything to replacing one ruling clique with another, but leaving inviolable the relations of private property. Any mass action by the people awakens various social strata to political life. Our party expresses unconditional support to those working people who is fighting against the abominations of capitalism and the ruling elite who have lost all shame. We see in their struggle the growth of the self-awareness of the working class, the acquisition of invaluable experience of successful struggle and the awareness of the need to organize the class. Of particular importance is the awareness of the need for class solidarity, the transition from demands for one master to demands for the entire ruling class, and from purely economic demands to political ones. We strongly condemn the actions of the declassed elements, provocateurs and marauders who joined the popular protest, discrediting the actions of the multinational proletariat of Kazakhstan and making it easier for the authorities to forcefully suppress strikes, rallies and demonstrations under the guise of ""protecting the population from terrorists.""

We see that it is still far from the revolutionary situation. So far, the workers of Kazakhstan have neither an organization, nor, moreover, a communist consciousness. But they took a step forward in their struggle, and this step must find our support.    
The authorities of Kazakhstan and the bourgeoisie of the Russian Federation with one voice are diligently bypassing the class essence of events and are trying to reduce their assessments to intimidation by the ""Maidan"". In the ranks of the protesters, pogromists and nationalists are already playing a provocative role. This is a well-known tactic of the bourgeoisie - to distort the essence of events, to reduce them from the class struggle to conspiracies and coups. The communists have already learned lessons from the events in Ukraine and have long warned that even if there was no Maidan, it would be profitable for the bourgeoisie to invent it as a scarecrow.    
We know that every step in the class struggle is a step forward. Today they will learn to make limited demands, they will feel their strength, having achieved a reduction in prices and the resignation of the government, tomorrow, you see, and a party with knowledge of the way will be found, - they will figure it out and go further - to socialism.    
We protest against the use of CSTO forces as gendarmes!    
We protest against the interference of the Russian Federation in the affairs of Kazakhstan and the possible use by the Russian authorities of the experience of the bloody suppression of the indignation of the people in October 1993.    
We demand from the authorities of Kazakhstan not to allow repressions against the people, we demand the release of all political prisoners, incl. convicted of participating in the Zhanaozen protests in 2011    
We demand freedom of action for trade unions, the abolition of bans on the activities of the Communist Party of the Republic, legalization of the actions of the Socialist Movement of Kazakhstan;    
There is no fascization of the CSTO regimes and authorities!    
Long live class solidarity!    
Long live proletarian internationalism!    
Workers of Russia! Rise to the fight against the power of capital together with Kazakhstani class brothers!

"Sexual violence affects EVERY woman not just those who are victims There was a news article saying “1 in 10 girls affected by sexual assault around the world” but I think it’s more than half affected. Out of the 9/10 not sexually violated, a majority have to change their schedules and activities to protect themselves and many fear being assaulted. If they went to parties and got blackout drunk, did solo travel in foreign countries where they don't speak the language, stayed at strangers' houses, hitchhiked, went walking alone at midnight like many boys do then over 9/10 would be raped or at least sexually assaulted. Don't credit me entirely for this statement because I am paraphrasing another feminist whose comment I saw and vaguely remember.

And yes, not all men rape. It's a tiny minority of the male population who rape and assault women. But the thing is that predators don't have a big red flag on their foreheads, so we have to be careful with all men. So it shouldn't be seen as unreasonable if we want to meet our SOs in public and get to know them before meeting up in private, if we are wary of men walking on the street, or we don't want unsupervised male babysitters for our children. Yes men get raped/assaulted too but most victims are female and most perpetrators are men, the reason for this being biological (men are stronger and bigger and it's easier to force penetration than it is to force someone to penetrate), so men don't fear it in their everyday lives as much as women do.",Liberal

"Women in workforce; are we focusing right? I (M38) am a person of colour, working in Australia and face this everyday at work that most of bosses are white males, all their bosses are almost all of them white male. 

With that layed out I question why we have so much of media focus and energy on ""Women in workforce"". Are we fighting the right battle? 

Women are getting assaulted by trusted males in their lives, women are not safe on streets, women are facing challenges in everyday life. Should we not focus more on that. 

I am not saying there women in workforce is NOT an issue. It is an issue, so is people of colour in leadership, which is where I am stuck at. I am far more capable from a lot of people I work with but I won't get to leadership sooner than them. They have the network, they have more common grounds with people in leadership. They will build stronger alliances and grow faster. 

My argument is we, both women and people of colour came in late. This was an issue 10, 20, 50 years ago. White males had a headstart and hence they have formed this network and trust at the top leave. We are surely breaking into it fast. I truely believe that making women safe or avoiding racism outside work will have a snowball effect.

"A leftist critique of central planning (and capitalism)  

Hi all,

I am a market socialist. Big advocate of free markets. However this piece in the Jacobin got me thinking recently: [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/03/economic-planning-walmart-democracy-socialism](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/03/economic-planning-walmart-democracy-socialism)

(heads up this is a long post, i do ask that before you respond you read all of it).

It  is an interesting piece that basically argues this: Walmart and Amazon  are large, super large, on the scale of countries like Switzerland or  Sweden (in terms of GDP). They represent large scale economic  organization with highly sophisticated logistics and distribution. If we  look at the internal mechanics of Walmart, it doesn't have like an  internal market. What it actually has is large scale planning, i.e. its  stores don't compete against each other, they share resources in shared  distribution hubs, complex algorithims and computer systems control  allocation and distribution, etc. This sounds an awful lot like a  planned economy. If such organization works for walmart, it could be  applicable to a wider economy.

Alright, so I don't fully agree with this and I am happy to explain why.

So,  I think on a really fundamental level, most people don't actually  understand what a market is and how it works, and on the same note, the  term planned economy is often misunderstood.

So let's start with some basic definitions: What is a planned economy?  
I  am specifically talking about centralized planned economies here.  Decentralized planning works better but a lot of the same issues can be  encountered, just on a smaller scale. So a planned economy is one  wherein the economic resources of a country are allocated according to  the directives of some central entity. This entity can be an elected  body, a dictator, an AI system, it doesn't matter, they are all  centralized entities. There are no prices under such a system, all  allocations are determined by this board.

Alright, so with that said let's talk Walmart. Is Walmart even a planned economy of sorts?

I would say no, and because of this you can't use walmart as a justification for a planned economy to work. Why not?

Well, economic planning is **NOT**  the same thing as a planned economy. Everyone plans, the difference is  in what environment that planning takes place in. So walmart isn't  making these economic decisions in a vacuum, it is relying on existing  price signals. A centrally planned board lacks these. Walmart allocates  its resources based on the cost and expected returns on goods in certain  localities. The same good at one walmart may not cost the same as it  does at another. Why? Because again, prices and resource allocations are  driven by local markets. There isn't a central board in walmart  controlling all allocation of resources, local stores request for  certain resources from local distribution centers each trying to  maximize profit. They are planning for their future, but they still  operate within the market environment and use the information there to  do it.

Now, you may say ""couldn't i just say i want x units of whatever and that would do the same thing"" Well no.

This is where an understanding of what markets are is important.

Markets,  on their most fundamental level are effectively a tool for information  gathering and for valuing goods. Let me explain. Let's say I want to buy  a laptop. The laptop costs $800. That does not mean the actual  objective value of the laptop is $800. What it means is that the seller  of the laptop values it at $800, and is willing to trade $800 for the  laptop.

So, prices don't represent  any objective value. And thus markets don't either.  What they do  represent is people's priorities. If I really really want a new laptop, I  am willing to spend more money on it. However, I only have a limited  amount of money. So I may not be able to buy both a laptop and a new TV.  However, I personally want the laptop more so I am willingly to  sacrifice the TV in order to get the laptop. And I am willing to spend  more on the laptop than someone who wants it less than me. Basically,  money in a market is a way of evaluating priorities. If I want something  more, I am willing to spend more. So, the spending of money allocates  resources in such a way to maximize pleasure given the limited resources  available (because everyone is spending the bulk of their money on the  resources they most want. Money is prioritized towards those desired  resources).  That's how markets actually work, the prices they have  represent how much I am willing to give up in order to have this item,  and thus its value to me. Prices do NOT represent actual value, they  represent a subjective value and markets are a tool to allocate limited  resources in the best way possible. Now of course, this only works  properly if everyone has relatively equal spending power (because I may  value a resource less but have a lot more money to spend than a poor  person. As a market socialist i would argue that inequality actually  breaks the market mechanism and is ineffecient, but that is a  conversation for a later day).

Anyways,  the issue with a planned economy is that it doesn't have prices. Why is  this a problem? Because it does not allow for the most  effecient/desirable allocation of resources (nor does capitalism for the  reason I outlined earlier, but again, conversation for another day).

See  in order to feed our AI algorithim, or our dictator, or our  democratically elected central allocation board information about what  to produce, we need to gather it somehow. The issue is that, without  prices, I can demand more than is feasible to produce. Let me explain.  Given our earlier example of the laptop and TV. Because I only have  limited money, I can only afford one of those items: either the laptop  or the brand new TV. However, without prices, when the central planning  information collectors come along I can ask for both the laptop and the  TV. That's great right? Well here's the issue. The whole point of  economics is to deal with scarcity. We only have so many resources with  which to produce laptops and TVs and what not. Because I don't have to  give up one for the other, I don't have to prioritize which I want more.  This means that resources can be allocated towards building my TV when  they could've been better allocated towards building a new phone for  somebody else. In short, a planned economy allows us to over-demand  given limited resources.

Could  this be addressed through a ranking system? Sure, but I think it is  gonna be difficult to pre-plan every possible item that you desire and  compile a ranking for the placement of each item before it is produced,  then submit this to the planning board. Like, not every choice is a  choice between two items. I could be choosing between a new TV a new  laptop a new phone or like a new XBox game etc. So we'd have to rank the  desirability of a lot of items compare to other items for every item.  It's really not feasible to do that.  Plus, in the time it takes to  process that, your rankings may have changed or you may want something  new. With an AI this would be a lot smoother than with a central  planning board of people sure, but still, it can easily lead to  misallocation. Having skin in the game forces you to better prioritize  goods, and doing that through prices leads to the best resource  allocation possible given the limited nature of resources.

There  are other issues with central planning boards as well, like the  aforementioned information going out of date quickly, the fact that even  if the allocation is done by an incorruptible AI the actual  distribution and production is still done by very corruptible humans,  the issues of actually gathering the information necessary for this to  work, etc. Walmart is only so effecient because it has prices which  allow for proper resource allocation. Messing with prices messed with  resource allocation in effecient manners. (Of course, massive wealth  concentration also does this, which is why i am not capitalist either).

Instead, if the mods will allow it, I'd like to hand in my option for a personalised flair and exchange it for a general flair. I would like to recommend some options.

Adding to that, I'd like to congratulate u/virbrevis to his victory as well as you all - apparently we all won due to a good joke :D

Let me assert my belief in the job and good work of this particular subreddit. Although I ain't a long-serving member of this sub (barely nine months), it was not only a good thing to see/meet like-minded people from all over the world, but to gain a better understandning of a lot of topics.

As most of you are aware, most of my effortposts are about historical matters stemming from my studies at university. But one thing that I learned in this sub as well as my activities in elections and daily party life showed me more to the movement than is ideology. While ideology is a necessary groundstone for the daily work and enthusiasm of our movement, Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism always defined itself as a synthesis of ideology and pragmatism.

As someone that is quite invested in the work of Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism, I would like to say the following:

*While our way will never be an easy one, while we might face great hurdles along this way, we will go our way. While it is a stony one, we will always go it. While personal matters strike us down or weaken us, when we are unhappy with ourselves and the world, we are weak from hard work - we will still stand up. While tragedy might strike us, while things might look bleak and the situation unnerving, all options gone - we will go our way.*

*With sunlight, knowledge and passion - the greatest assets humankind has ever posessed - we will go our way. On it we shall never stop or hold for just a second - instead we shall continuously walk it. Let us be a unified group of people, that care for the same things and fight for the betterment of humanity and a better future. While we may differ in the smaller things, let us be united in the greater common cause of things - a line that shall not only connect us, but let us become brothers and sisters. To not be blinded by personal greed, instead working for the greater cause of society and humanity in all fields of life.*

*In rememberance to all the great idols of the movement that shared not only their minds, but their whole lives for the cause of a better world, let us carry their ideals like a flag forwards on the way we are walking. And let their ideas be the torches that will light the darkness that is the future, the unknown land. For we shall not fear of change, not be afraid of the future - as we will continue our way with peace of mind and without fear. Let us be the first line of attack for a better future for all, leaving no one behind - at the same time, let us not forget about those that have perished on the way, as we are deeply and eternally thankful for their deeds, help and service.*

*With these tools, my dear friends, I don't fear the future - on the contrary. Together I believe we shall persevere the darkness and walk into a bright future. On this spot I'll guarantee you that I will always be on your side, to give my full strength and mind to this cause - as it is the greatest cause of humankind. So let us walk this way together, united all over the world with the cries of millions, the torches and flags - shouting our eternal slogan: Democracy - Liberty, Justice, Solidarity forever!*

2) Is there precedent for this? I assume presidents have a big legal teams, but the idea of a president going in and actively fighting a state law with their own lawyers seems kind of really weird.

I  currently work for a large pizza chain, and I'm in a rather large US  city. I am an assistant manager, and I hate every second of it.

My store's GM has told me that other GMs in the area are about as fed-up with the way the employees are treated by corporate as the minimum-wage employees are. He also told me how most of the other GMs nearly quit,  effectively all at once.  
*I know we have the backing* for the scale that we need to make changes.

*Most stores are working with broken equipment*,  and the amount of work far outweighs the pay. We aren't allowed to schedule the bodies we need in the store because it ""costs too much,""  but we are *consistently* understaffed. There's so much more that needs to be changed but I'd rather not get into it right now.

How do I get started on the organization process? How do I even get the word out? What else do I need besides the backing of a large majority of the employees in the area and a list of legitimate changes that need to be made?

*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

"A Rant About Liberals and the Online Left. First of all, if you aren't going to read this whole thing, don’t bother commenting. I’d love to talk about this with other leftists, and to brainstorm ideas. If you are just going to comment vitriol, I’m not going to talk with you. Just hear me out, and read the whole post. I’m a baby lefty, and have only been so for about a year, so any *meaningful* discussions would be well appreciated.

So, This is a bit of a rant about an issue that I have with leftist online spaces, especially those on reddit. My issue is specifically with how we talk about and deal with liberals. Let me be clear, to preempt the comments. I do not like liberal*ism*. This is not me trying to give apologia to that ideology. Liberal ideology inevitably leads to exploitation and to imperialism. I do, however, think that now, with the clear failures of liberal capitalism being shown to the whole world, now we have a chance that is greater than ever before to offer up leftist ideology as an alternative to our current capitalist system. 

On r/ShitLiberalsSay, one of the most common posts you see is liberals talking down to conservatives. The liberals will say stuff like “republicans deserve to live in poverty because they vote red.” or elitist talking points about how republicans are all poor and uneducated. We see this kind of thing, and successfully recognize that it is not republicans fault for the conditions they live in. they have a media that manufactures their consent away from class based solutions to their problems, to focus on meaningless Culture War bullshit. We feel sympathy for them, as they kept from being able to address what would seriously help them. They are Lumpenproletariat, kept from ever opening their eyes to what would actually solve their problems. 

What I see as weird, is whenever we talk about liberals, the attitude changes. People talk about liberals like they are all Billionaires, CEOs, or politicians. But they aren't. The average liberal is just a regular person, who, like conservatives, is led to a party that represents no meaningful change. They are also victims of Red-Scare propaganda, a media that manufactures consent, and an education system that makes them out to be yes-men for a system that seeks to exploit them. But we never seem to talk about it. Whereas every conversation about conservatives is framed around how they are victims of brainwashing, conversations about liberals seem to revolve around how they will “all face the wall when the revolution comes.” (Now I should say, I have no issue with the ultra wealthy elite and politicians being punished when/if the time comes, but 99% of the population cannot be executed if we want to have a successful revolution.) This puzzles me, because I don’t see why we don't dedicate more of our energy to bringing liberals left. It seems to me like we should be dedicating much more of our energy to radicalization. Whenever I look to leftist circles, it looks like instead of trying to bring people left, we just seem to wait for people to stumble left on their own. Contrast this to the right, and even specifically the alt-right, with their radicalization rabbit-holes, and active cultivation of bringing “normies” into their grips. We make no such effort to try to get the average person to the left. And I think this is a major missed opportunity. 

Liberalism gained it’s near universal appeal by promising to bring prosperity and freedom to everybody. Obviously, it has utterly failed to bring about this, but those reasons are why people still believe in it today. This is where our chance is. The way to actually achieve these results are through socialist actions, meaning we have a real chance to get these people and bring them to our side. The average liberal, someone who ISN’T ultra wealthy, or politically powerful, wants these like we do. The difference being of course, they’ll never actually achieve it through bourgeois democracy. 

Now we have our greatest chance. The distrust and hatred of the system is everywhere. Even in mainstream places like r/politics, you can see people talking about how our politicians don’t work for us, and how our economy only favors the ultra-wealthy. This is our shot. With so many people seeing the flaws in “the system” it is our chance to identify this not as some nebulous “system” but capitalism. We have a serious chance here to radicalize people to anti-capitalism. 

To preempt some naysayers. Yes, liberals can be radicalized. Yes, they (some of them) can be reasoned with. Unless you were born a leftist, there is a good chance that you were a liberal at some point, and you managed to find your way here. You were convinced of leftism's merits, and now you want to abolish capitalism. Once again, The average liberal isn’t super rich, they don’t own billions, they are poor millennials or Gen-Xers living in cities. They voted blue, not because they know that the democratic party won’t provide any meaningful change, and won’t challenge power structures, they vote blue because they *think* it will bring about change. They think it will help improve people’s conditions. Especially with the failures of the Biden administration, we have a serious chance to rip off the blindfolds. 

Capitalism is facing it’s greatest crisis yet. And it’s one of its own making. Between climate change, economic inequality, and COVID, discontent with our capitalist way of life is at an all-time high. Now we should be exploiting this chance to radicalize people, and bring them into our movement. 

Once again, I would be really excited to discuss things with everyone, as long as it's in good faith. 

TLDR: just about everybody sees that the system isn't working, the average liberal isn't a billionaire or CEO, so with all of the crises facing capitalism, we should be out radicalizing people, not sitting down and waiting for them to radicalize themselves.",Liberal

 (6) An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or another form of psychological distress solely because of the individual's race or sex;

 (10) Promoting division between, or resentment of, a race, sex, religion, creed, nonviolent political affiliation, social class, or class of people; or

(11) Ascribing character traits, values, moral or ethical codes, privileges, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of the individual's race or sex.

This amendment does not prohibit an LEA or public charter school from including, as part of a course of instruction or in a curriculum or instructional program, or from allowing teachers or other employees of the LEA or public charter school to use supplemental instructional materials that include:

Culture normalise male violence to such an extent that we consider violence against men as the default and only giving it a prefix when it is against women.  However no matter who the victem is death, injury and live long trauma is the result.

Men's violence against men and the toxic masculinity that teaches men that acting in this way is excepted needs to be examined and combated.  Feminism gives us the tools to combat this toxin so men's violence against men has to be considered within feminism.",Liberal
"Conflating socialism with Marxism has caused damage on the socialist movement ""Before Marxists *established a hegemony over definitions of socialism*, the term socialism was a broad concept which referred to one or more of various theories aimed at solving the labour problem through radical changes in the capitalist economy. Descriptions of the problem, explanations of its causes and proposed solutions such as the abolition of private property or supporting cooperatives and public ownership varied among socialist philosophies.""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_socialism

Thanks to Marxism and derivatives the socialist narrative has largely been about the mode of production, many times neglecting social issues to focus on materialism. Socialists have fought for social rights issues for a long time—yet the mode of production, to seize control over it and completely remove private ownership is always there at the center. *I think this is disingenuous to the root of socialism which as I have said a million times is to care for the people's well being*.

Marx, Engels and so many others seem to think that classes, specifically economic classes are the root cause of most if not all strife. *That is simply not true* and simplifies something that yes, is partially deeply rooted in economic class differences, but social factors are equally if not even more important. 

I recently officially joined the Social Democrats (Swe) after going to my first ever political meeting (with SocDems). As a socialist I felt at home as they/we talked about for example school and physical activities like sports. The other guys organize and talk to various sports organizations to ask them what it is they want, such as upgrades to sporting facilities. So in one way or another it more or less almost always comes back to money, sure, but that is the very society we live in today. But my point is that the main focus was always, in this meeting, *on just improving things in life for others*. THERE you have what line of thought led to the creation of socialism hundreds of years ago; to see how unfair the world is and simply wanting to improve it due to your own empathy for others. Does this apply to other ideologies as well? Well of course it does. But that does not mean it still isn't what basically started socialism. Socialism is thus, or orginially was and as such at its core about certain ways to improve the world.

The longer people do not see socialism for the spectrum that it really is and *always* has been the longer we will stay divided amongst the various socialist communities, between socialists and non-socialists and even between non-socialists as someone might hate socialism because they think it is one very specific thing, leading to anti-sentiment rather than just preferring something else.

Socialism is not one thing so please consider that whenever discussing socialism.",Liberal

"Am I the mad one? This is one of my first text based rants and I didn't want to make it to long so if you have questions or you have suggestions please feel free to comment.

 

Lately I feel like everything around is so messed up in a lot of ways. I feel like everyone is choosing to ignore the fact that we are soon going to reach a point of irreversibility in the sense that soon we will not be able to do anything to stop or slow down climate change (approximately 7 and a half years). And what baffles me is the superficiality around it. 

Constantly we are told by companies that it is down to us to change this. 'Oh, you can save the earth by not driving around so much and by trying to eat less meat'. While yes, these methods work to reduce our individual carbon emissions, it is not merely enough to stop climate change from becoming a problem in the near future. Most of the carbon emissions are from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation. And what is even more surprising is how obvious is the fact that these problems are a fault of the system and how in the current system we cannot stop climate change. 

Furthermore, I would not say that this is a “fault” per se, as one of the main traits of capitalism is to increase the capital of certain people more and more even though it can lead to the destruction of our planet. Michael Parenti said that “The essence of capitalism is to turn nature into commodities and commodities into capital”. This is because Capitalism promotes a growth fetish of capital. It promotes creating an infinite amount of money, even though the resources that it uses to create that capital are finite. This is a main contradiction of Capitalism. You can not have an infinite of something if that something needs something that is finite to be produced. 

Some people may argue that ‘Yes, some companies use fossil fuels a lot however, they do other things to make up for it, for example they plant trees’. To that I present you with studies that show that forests only have a temporary effect as they do have their own lifespans, and trees planted now will not affect the carbon cycle in any way for many years. Also, another big thing that produces a lot of Greenhouse Gases is industrial farming of beef which releases massive amounts of Carbon Dioxide and Methane in the Atmosphere. 

Anyways, I want to say that it is astonishing how we can ignore something like this that endangers billions of people’s lives. Something that will cause famines, extreme poverty, death and extinction of many species and biodiversity. And we can not say that we did not know. Evidence for Climate Change being caused by man has existed since the 1910s-1920s. Over 100 years ago we knew that fossil fuels would destroy the earth at one point and yet we decided that increasing the capital of some people was more important because why not? 

What is to be done about it is a big question that I do not have a fixed answer on, I and other people only have hypotheses, but the big idea is that we can only do trial and error. But I am pretty sure that at the moment we have no other way to counter climate change than by a popular protest or even the creation of a counter culture like the hippies had in the 60-70s. We need protests like the student protests in 1968 France. Although we need to not replicate exactly the past. We know what worked and what didn’t. What we need now is a new counterculture that can make people imagine a better future (an example of this could be the solarpunk culture). We need something that is spiritual, a new way to think, a new way to see, a new way to love and live. We need to get rid of the notion that capital is what a person should be reduced too.",Liberal

"Russian trolls, Trump, and the Arizona “fraudit” Russian trolls, Trump, and the Arizona “fraudit”

All over Reddit, paid Russian government disinformation trolls are defending the fraudulent Arizona recount. Often, their defense is subtle — “let it play out”, “Trump lost and can’t be reinstated, so what’s the harm?”, “if you didn’t commit fraud, why are you afraid of the recount?”, “how is it fraudulent?” And we know that Putin’s piglet (what the Russian media calls Trump) sees this “fraudit” as his last hope. The fact that Russian trolls are so ardently defending it shows that Putin, too, sees it as his last chance to get Trump back in or, at the very least, to cause widespread violent unrest in the country.

Please write to your Congressman and Senators expressing your concern and urging them to press the DOJ to take action. If the Trumpist/QAnon firm conducting the bogus Arizona “audit” succeeds in altering enough ballots to falsely claim Trump won Maricopa County, Republicans all over the country will force the same procedure in every state Biden flipped and very well might take to the streets with even more violence than on January 6. This farce needs to be stopped now!

Just to recap about the “recount”:

1. ⁠AZ elections officials, including Republicans, conducted several recounts and found no discrepancies. They certified the vote as accurate. So, this is just grandstanding and a political power-play. 

2. ⁠The company Cyber Ninjas doing this farcical recount has no experience in such a thing, were hired by partisan Republicans, and are headed by a man who is a declared Trumpist and a Q anon adherent.

3. ⁠There is no oversight

4. ⁠It is illegal for non elections officials to handle sealed ballots

When this first started, those doing the recount had blue pens with them, which are totally illegal to have near a ballot as they can be used to alter a ballot. A judge had to stop that, but it was not until time had elapsed.",Liberal

"The Cheating Wife/Woman and how her story sometimes tragically ends (in fiction and reality) Cheating has been going on since, well as long as humans have been around basically. Desire is a part of us and we often act on it. Sex is one of our primary and greatest desires (unless you're asexual and nothing bad about that, just to make it clear). In relationships we know people sometimes desire others when they're already with someone. Sometimes they pursue the other person/people and sometimes they don't. Sometimes it remains a secret and other times it doesn't...but...what happens...when the secret is revealed...bad things may happen.

Now men cheat too, it happens and they do get confronted too, sometimes attacked (which isn't great either). I'm not saying it isn't understandable why someone would get mad at learning someone they're with had cheated. But what some do once they've learned the truth...is horrifying.

Now, it seems that in fiction, there's a difference in how often a cheating man is presented in contrast to a cheating woman. In one film (which I can't remember and didn't watch), but a man who had a wheelchair-bound wife as a result of an accident they were in (and she blames him for while taking her anger out on him while seeking some kind of miracle cure) and he has an affair with a woman (who is also married) yet it's supposed to represent a means of sympathy for him. That his affair is understandable and that he isn't bad for what he does. (There's also the matter of his wife being found dead and him being suspected of it, but I didn't watch the film so I don't know what happened.) This isn't to say how it's always presented, but it speaks as to how the cheating man is portrayed.

However, in the 1995 film Above Suspicion, a woman cheats on her paralyzed husband...and...I don't know what happened to her and her lover...but I saw some horrifying comments online that they 'deserved what happened'...and I know her husband planned their murder from the hypnosis...and I think he got away with it (didn't watch the movie). But it's framed in more than one 'colorful' way by people that she deserved what happened to her because she was cheating on him. We see women humiliated, degraded, beaten...and murdered because they cheated on a man. Women will be threatened with guns...or gunned down by men once they learned of the affairs.

Here's two links that shows in regards to the film I mentioned how some say what happened to the lady was deserved:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDxt8G0n6lM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDxt8G0n6lM)

[https://letterboxd.com/realy\_bad/film/above-suspicion-1995/](https://letterboxd.com/realy_bad/film/above-suspicion-1995/)

In our world, there are men who have murdered their wives, fiancés, and girlfriends for learning they cheated on them. The women's deaths have been all kinds of horrifying and cruel. And fiction reflects this. Women die usually cruel deaths at the hands of men for being in affairs and people will say they deserved it, that they were glad it happened. Some say it should be expected if cheating happens. One guy on a site said he'd be glad to find out his wife was cheating so he could, as he said, decapitate her. And there are...stories where women have met such fates for cheating.

I know cheating is a sore spot for people and it garners heated attitudes from some. Some despise it no matter what, some perhaps aren't judgmental, but the 'popular' perspective is contempt. (I have never been in a relationship or been with anyone, but I find it complicated...and I certainly don't believe someone should be killed for being in/having an affair. As a guy, I don't know if this means more or less for what I'm saying. Maybe this is a statement coming from privilege...I don't know...but I felt regardless, it's something that should be said.)

Yes, men have died for being involved in affairs and this is also terrible. When we look at it, it's often the men a woman is cheating with (as in the movie I said and in other fiction, such as the movie Shooting the Warwicks where a cheating wife and the man she slept are murdered by her husband...and in several crime shows the same thing happens). Yet we also see where the women men cheat with are killed, but not the man at the hands of the/because of the wife as a way to 'punish' the cheating man. The women die, but he lives. We really don't, or don't usually, see this in the opposite case. The cheating woman and man die, or just the cheating wife.

Just...the women dying...for just embracing/acting on desires...is terrible...and it's cruel that men can/do get away with it. A few decades ago in Kentucky, a man learned his wife was sleeping with a Senator's son and murdered them both, but got away scot free because it was 'a matter of honor'. Men have murdered cheating women for millennia and gotten away with it, hell, they're often celebrated/uplifted for 'giving the woman what she deserved'.

No one should die for being involved in/having an affair. If someone thinks they should/tries to kill that person for cheating, they deserve to be cheated on. (A controversial opinion/perspective, I admit...but the suffering of women is often some of the worst when she acts on her desires...and society applauds when she gets her 'just desserts'.)

(I'm sorry for the rant...but...I keep coming across these stories, both in reality and in fiction...and I couldn't keep not saying something. Such stories replay in my mind constantly, and my heart breaks, my blood boils...and I cry...I know this may flair tempers and some may call me insane for this...but...women shouldn't die for being involved in affairs...)",Liberal

"Michael Brooks: Sympathy Is Not Solidarity (2019) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq-ki_wr9JY

> This focus on the [Professional–managerial class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class), it's very relevant for shows like this because many of us watching, listening and participating are part of it in one way or another. And it's important because it reflects a certain type of politics that, even at it's most well-meaning, negates the fundamental project of solidarity and unity, which is driven by a real bottom-up class politics. Which is essential for the actual work of graduating from capitalism, moving to a post-capitalist world, which is the only way to fundamentally deal with the collapse of all Earth living systems that we are experiencing today as well as reconciling the contradictions between the limits of markets — overproduction, global debt cycles. How many more commons are there really left out there to move into the private market? Well, the ones we have left are extremely dangerous and disturbing. We have human genetic materials and we also have the Internet and the technologies of the future, which have already turned into tools of militarization and mass surveillance. So we need a politics that centers democracy and the commons and is built on true broad-based social bonds.

> And in order to understand some of the different sentiments in place, we need to talk about the difference between sympathy and solidarity. Having sympathy with working people is important, but it's not the same as people having solidarity with one another.

> In fact, the theorist, the father of capitalism himself, Adam Smith claimed that the tendency to admire rich people and despise the poor is the great and universal cause of corruption of our moral sentiments. He understood the moral difference here. He was actually quite persuasive in his moral condemnations of certain types of obscene wealth, even as he obviously was a promoter with massive blind spots around capitalism. In our society we often demonize poor & working class people, and then confuse a sympathy which might run counter to that demonization with actual solidarity. Our politics need to be built on solidarity.

> It's not about pity. In Buddhism, there's actually a brilliant teaching on what's called the ""near enemies"". And these are desirable states that are confused with undesirable states. So as an example, one is equanimity with indifference. Dealing with crisis and seeing things in life and in the world, and dealing with it with some measure of equanimity is great. Having indifference to it is not. Some people confuse that. And they also talk specifically about confusing compassion with pity. Pity is separating yourself from the action, it's fundamentally condescending, it's fundamental distinction making. It is not we're actually in this together in, as an example, a shared class struggle against the capital class.

> Solidarity means empowering people to win power and write their own rules. Fundamentally, a politics of solidarity is about a belief in people in your community and outside of your community. It's a belief in the possibility that we can come together and build a genuinely democratic world in all spheres including the economic one. Building solidarity is not just a question of sympathy, it's something the Left has struggled to do. Too many in the Left aren't willing to do that work. The working class is diverse and dynamic; they aren't going to come prepackaged sharing all of your beliefs, cultural prejudices, and social practices. Solidarity is sharing community with people who by definition are not the same as you in every category.

> Lula was able to build a politics of solidarity and a diverse working class movement in Brazil, which he is reassembling today. And I want to just play some of this clip because it's relevant tonally, and it's also inspiring. Lula is in fact out of prison. And even as Bolsonaro continues to run through wrecking Brazil, destroying the Amazon, pushing through a militant neoliberal and neo-fascistic agenda; the social movements, the leadership, the bottom-up, and a leader that leads from solidarity is out there. And remember this is President Lula before he voluntarily turned himself in for an unjust, corrupt political imprisonment rallying his supporters...

> ... People need to understand Gramsci's concept of the [organic intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#Intellectuals_and_education), which is really, in some ways, just a reaffirmation of the notion that — which, again, is all too often totally missing from liberal circles in America, and, of course, always under onslaught and con-artistry and war from the right-wing. Which is that working-class people can understand and contextualize their own circumstances. It is not just wrong for people to not understand that, it's fundamentally condescending, and it does not create the necessary politics of solidarity. Gramsci rejected this, and also, crucially, the idea that the working class was incapable of producing their own intellectuals. The job of the Left is to promote and empower members of different groups to produce their own intellectuals and leaders capable of organizing their class against capital hegemony. This is a project that only a politics of solidarity can create, and a politics of PMC sympathy outright rejects. Gramsci wrote ""I'm a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will."" We need to build a movement that can handle the contradictions and confusions of the modern world steeped in the intellectual traditions that can bring us the necessary clarity. But to also build a world and base our politics on an unshakeable optimism of will. This will only come from a community of solidarity and the interconnected movement that it can build. Sympathy can be a great starting point, but solidarity is the goal.",Liberal

"A Call for Unity among Radical Feminists in the Fight to Amend the Equality Act **Feminists in Struggle (FIST) have posted an Open Letter from Feminists in Struggle to the Interim Steering Committee of the Women’s Human Rights Campaign USA: A Call for Unity among Radical Feminists in the Fight to Amend the Equality Act.**

FIST's Open Letter notes that the Interim Steering Committee (ISC) of the Women’s Human Rights Campaign (WHRC) recently released the “Equality for All Act,” its own version of an amended Equality Act (EA), a bill pending in Congress that would add “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” as protected sub-classes under the category of “sex” in federal discrimination laws.

--

FIST's Open Letter notes that the revision of the bill that the ISC has produced is less comprehensive and actually far less protective of the sex-based rights of women and girls than FIST’s Feminist Amendments to the Equality Act that pre-date ISC’s version by more than a year.

--

FIST believes that the approach of FIST’s Feminist Amendments is significantly more protective of sex-based rights than ISC’s draft bill for two reasons: 

  1.   the Feminist Amendments spell out that female-only spaces and programs do not constitute discrimination based on sex or sex stereotyping; and 

  1.  the Feminist Amendments make robust findings about the subordinate status of women in society, the pervasive nature of male violence, and the need for women-only spaces and programs in the interests of achieving true equality for the female sex.

"I need help editing a post about African Imperialism meant to radicalize my friends Hello, I'm new to this sub but definitely not the online left overall. I was working on a post to help radicalize my friends on Facebook and I need help editing/finishing it, and sourcing reasources related to the topic at the end. I started to get really burnt out towards the end and felt like it was getting unorganized and ranty, and I want to fix that and get feedback overall. 
The post is bellow is for black history month, my goal is to connect America's history of racism  to modern exploitation of Africa specifically (I have a lot of BLM supporters on my friendslist,) and show how America's elite export racism, exploitation, and most of its issues to poorer, and mostly minority countries. I don't want to mention capitalism, or socialism in the post or language like that, because that can easily put off people in the early stages of their journey toward being a leftist, or make them think I'm trying to co opt black issues for political reasons. 
I'd especially like help on how to order the things I'm saying, what should be removed vs what should be expanded upon, and good things to include in the additional reasources section.

Here's the rough draft I have so far:


If you consider yourself anti racist, and an ally to black people, or even a decent human being, and don't want to be like the same people who did nothing while slavery was happen not fighting against, or questioning it then you need to read this, educate yourself. It may seem like the majority of the battle against racism is done, or maybe you've put in your part by supporting BLM, however that can't be farther from the truth. 
Our nations wealth has been, and still is built off the exploitation of others (especially minorities), with both being the larger now than ever. The exploitation our nations wealth is built off of is like a virus, evolving and responding to every attempt to stop it. If fighting against the exploitation of others isn't enough of a call to action, then consider this quote 

""The elite, cocky and filled with greed, will sell the rope that is used to hang themselves.""

It's projected that America will soon not be the wealthiest or most poweful nation on Earth, with the reason being the greed which led our elite to chase cheaper labor and less regulation being to blame. 

With it being black history month, and I'd like to remind you that America's racism is alive stronger than ever, with things far worse than slavery happening to fuel American consumerism and wealth. Most the world, but especially Africa carries the burden for our countries wealth and our comfortable lives, its a necessity to fight against that to truly care about black lives. The BLM movement was important for fighting for the rights of black people in our country, but they are a tiny fraction of the black people oppressed by us, and far from the ones worst effected. 

In the past we shipped African slaves to America to build our own wealth and expand our influence, its a fallacy that this dynamic ever ended or even improved. Now instead America builds its wealth in Africa directly by exploiting it's workers and reasources, topling any governments that challenge them, all under the guise of spreading our wealth and ideals (neither of which are true or help Africans.) 

It may seem hopeless when learning about stuff like this, or seem pointless to the point you think learning about politics/news is a waste of time, but trust me there's hope, you just need to believe in the humanity of your fellow man. The few always will have less power than the many, my hope lies in believing that with a true understanding of what shapes our society a majority of people will think it'd wrong and be willing to fight against it. When you believe this the only barrier to change is educating the many on the true enemy, I believe no matter how much propaganda and control is used the power of the truth can overcome. 

 The elite can and have easily toppled many countries that threaten their power, however the people there still fought despite this. As citizens of America we pose the greatest threat to the elite because our privilege, they can't use a fraction of the tools they use in other countries to stop a threat to their power here. While in other countries they can use military police, assassinations of political figures, destruction of economies, and much more, their main tools they can use in America itself are already in use. For their system to continue they need us to not know the atrocities they commit, the alternatives that exist, the fact we don't need them, and most importantly the power we hold to change things. Us feeling hopeless, apathetic, using all our effort to fix symptoms, instead of the root issues, and believing them is the glue that holds this whole system together. The majority of books on propaganda you read were directed at this exact system, not some theoretical society or far off land like North Korea.

"How to argue with your conservative relatives: This is what I've learned from personal experience and watching other people on how to convince conservative (and libertarian) family members that your positions are the best ones. This is a U.S. based topic, but I think a lot of these tips can also apply to other countries. If you think of anything major I missed, I'll add it in with edits.

1. Optics. This is the biggest one that stems into most of the other tips in this post. Winning a debate is unfortunately not about being correct, but looking most like you're making the better point. Whoever looks better is going to win. If something you're doing is correct, but it's clearly not going over well, move on to something else. And if you find something that resonates with people, keep going.
2. Have evidence behind what you say. By this I do not mean that you should bring documents to thanksgiving dinner, or have sources up on your phone before a conversation starts. But, you should have a couple of important bits of peer-reviewed evidence that you have memorized, and that you can find easily on the internet in just a minute or two.
3. Never get mad. This is EXTREMELY important. Getting annoyed is totally fine, since it can make you feel more passionate and genuine, but you never want to get fully angry. First of all, when a person is angry it subconsciously makes the people around them think they're less reasonable, which looks bad on you. Second of all, when going up against a conservative or when you have conservative people watching you, you REALLY do not want to look like the stereotypical ""triggered liberal."" This is a death sentence, as then they can scapegoat themselves and focus more on making fun of you for being mad over thinking about WHY you're mad.What's even better is if THEY get mad. If they get mad, it makes THEM look unreasonable. Now we'll get into this more later, but right then is the PERFECT time to call them ""Trigged"" or a ""Snowflake.""
4. Don't look too extreme. Now I want to be clear: There isn't anything inherently wrong with BEING radical, but you never want to make it SEEM that way to the person you're talking to and the people around you. You can still absolutely seem like a leftist, in fact, that's what I'd recommend, since if you do well it makes it seem like leftism is the best ideology. But, if you start out too strong, with things like Eat The Rich, people are going to be inherently biased against you from the beginning. Talk about raising the Minimum Wage and a 35 hour work week instead (I know those things aren't considered particularly ""leftist"" in most first world countries, but they are in the U.S.).If you want to show a more radical side, you can talk to a person you convinced a bit later and be a bit more specific and open about what you think.
5. Another big one: Use their language against them. Let's say your opponent says they believe in freedom, something most conservatives like to say they do. They then use this to justify lowering taxes on billionaires and removing the minimum wage. Then, you can agree with them. ""I also believe in Freedom. The only problem is, giving bosses the ability to lower the minimum wage actually makes the country less free, since people can get forced into working longer hours for almost no pay just to buy bread."" Then, later in the argument when LGBT issues inevitably get brought up, you can mention Freedom again. ""Oh, I love freedom. I think every adult should be free to marry any other adult they want to. I thought you believed in freedom too, so why do you oppose this?"" This shows people the fundamental contradiction in Conservative thought, and also looks really, really good on your image. You can also do this with the whole ""Facts over Feelings"" thing by citing trans positive reliable studies, ""Stop the Steal"" to reference the January Six coup, and say that you want to ""Make America Great Again"" by reinstating the economic policies that led to a golden age in the 1960s, like a low cost of living and highly exponential income tax. ONE VERY IMPORTANT BIT OF NUANCE: In general, don't bring up these catchphrases before they do. This makes it look like you're strawmanning them, which to be honest, you kind of would be. There are a few exceptions, like you can bring up Make America Great Again if they're a known Trump supporter, but if it's pretty much ambiguous on whether or not they would use the phrase, don't bring it up.
6. Humor in large groups. This is one pretty much just for the dinner table or the living room, when there's at least two people besides you in the room. Don't try to make a joke unless you are pretty certain it will go over well with at least one bystander. Jokes are one of the best ways to pass of something that a person wouldn't normally agree with as something they like. It's like a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down. This is why so many Nazis become Nazis through memes, although for them it's sugar on top of a bunch of sewage. Anyway, if you can make a joke that a person or two will genuinely find funny and will also understand the point of, that can help a fair bit.
7. Keep it simple. Only bring up things that, for the most part, everyone will understand. More niche political terms aren't usually good in family arguments. Don't go too intricate with what you talk about, if you do that then you'll have to spend more time explaining what you just said over actually saying things. Most of all, you want your arguments to make sense both linguistically and intuitively.The exception to this is if somebody asks you a specific question. If the topic is pretty much over and somebody asks, ""Well then what IS the difference between Socialism and Communism?"" then you can go, ""I'm glad you asked. Here you go:""

"New commune initiative in Europe We (a group of 7 currently) would like to create a commune somewhere in the southern Europe (Galicia looks like a good place). I suppose this initiative may be relevant for people here.

The commune is to be built on the following premise: recreating society based on the scientific method, principles commonly accepted in science and open debate in order to maximise fulfilment and wellbeing of a human life.

The above-mentioned premise is the only thing that commune members should agree with. Everything else is to be derived from the premise. However, a commune member should also be open-minded as decision making is based on respectful debates. So be ready to debate on the topics of egalitarianism, antinatalism, veganism, anticapitalism, environmentalism, etc.

The reason for wanting to make a shared value system based on the premise is that one of the reasons why communes fail seems to be heterogeneity in values. With the proposed method we expect to solve that issue because people tend to do things that they find to be right if there are no obstacles. The reason why we have many different stances on things is because people may think that their stance is correct or someone else's stance is wrong because they based it on a different premise, have different information or a fault in logic. We took into account those three.

The currently proposed government/economic model looks pretty much like socialism. Hence, posting to this sub.

**Government/economic model**

No money or private property (to a sensible degree) in the commune. A non-profit organisation (NPO) will be established that is going to own all assets and handle monetary interactions with the outside world. Community members will be voting on all expenses that are going to be done by the NPO. The vote should be unanimous. If not, a debate will be held until everyone agrees. 

For-profit companies (FPCs) will be created in order to get money from the outside world. Companies should not require members to leave the community (or at least they must agree). The work that has to be done will be kept at minimum (no 40 hour work weeks). Members vote on what companies are established and how they operate. Example: a software development company (or some other remote work company), where community members volunteer to do work. Instead of hiring workers, companies can hire our company (no need to pay social tax, multiple people instead of one). 

Members are responsible for ensuring prosperity of the commune. Required jobs will be agreed upon together and posted for anyone to perform. Every member decides themselves how much they work and what they do.

"Proposal for how a market socialist ""stock"" market could work Hello,

So I know that this sub is mainly soc dems and dem socs, but I honestly think you guys can get on board with this too. Will post in other subs as well.

So, the whole idea of a market socialism is that the workers own the companies they work at. I like that idea for a lot of reasons, but one very common criticism is that these coops may have trouble with funding. I have spent a great deal of time thinking about this issue and I have come up with several solutions. I have discussed three of them elsewhere (bond market, credit unions, and crowdfunding) but now I have an idea that I think even a capitalist would agree would work on a large scale.

Here it is:

So the issue that a lot of coops are trying to solve is the same that I have with capitalism: the right to absentee ownership. Basically, the idea is this: If a capitalist buys some machine and hires a worker to work on it, the capitalist can take some of the money generate by the worker so long as they own the machine (the worker doesn't get full value of labor). It would be fair for the capitalist to be compensate for the cost of buying the machine, but not have profits from it forever. If the worker ever says ""hey, screw this, I don't want to send excess money to the guy sitting around doing nothing"" then the capitalist can use police or the state to reclaim their property. Essentially the worker is forced to work at a lower rate than what they provide.

This is the key problem with capitalism (for me at least). We could argue about that issue, but that's not the point of this post. The point is my solution. So if the issue is permanent private absentee ownership, wouldn't it be ok if the coop sold a futures contract based on some preferred stock (non-voting stock representing some ownership of the firm and entitlement to profits). Basically the idea is this: A futures contract is a legal entity wherein an asset is agreed to be bought or sold at a particular price at a particular time. So what if the futures contract was tied to preferred stock (meaning the coop would buy back the stock at a given price and time). This would allow temporarily allow trading of stock in the coop. It would not be permanent, as it is time limited, and, because the workers are the ones writing the deal, they would set it up so that the value coming from trading the stock at that time is greater than any cost, thus ensuring no worker exploitation (they're not gonna try and exploit themselves or undersell themselves, they want the highest price possible).

In short, you basically have a stock market that's actually based on futures contracts based on preferred stock. Right now, many coops have investor members and owners of stock, and others sell preferred stock, so this could be built on already existing systems.

"The welfare state and democratic elements of Australia I decided to do a write up going into some aspects of Australia's welfare state and democratic form of government, this won't cover every aspect of every specific thing but I tried to get most of the important stuff, hopefully you find this interesting.

\- Australia has a universal health insurance system called Medicare, this insurance covers 100% of the costs for many services and care at public hospitals and a portion of the cost at private hospitals and is funded by a 2% levy on taxable income. Services which are covered under Medicare are also listed under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, depending on the situation medicare reimburses anywhere between 75 and 100 percent of the schedule fees, depending on what the service is and whether it was conducted at a private or public hospital. One of the main things missing from Medicare currently is dental, however there is dental coverage for children and and emergency services for adults with a pensioner concession card. There is also the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is a list of medicines that the federal government buys in order to lower the price, however drugs not within this scheme can be quite expensive, but most needed pharmaceutical medications are covered. Many General Practitioners do bulk billing which means consultations are of no cost under medicare, however those who do not do bulk billing can still have a portion of the costs subsidized under medicare. There are also caps on the gap costs for Medicare as it relates to out of hospital services which is currently $495.60 AUD this value gets indexed to the Consumer Price Index every year. Other things like the emergency room are free, while ambulances are only free and covered in Queensland and Tasmania, in every other state if you want ambulances to be covered you need to buy ambulance insurance. Along with medicare there is also the National Disability Insurance scheme which covers all the costs related to dealing with disabilities for those with permanent disabilities.

\- Every Australian worker is entitled to a minimum of 4 weeks (20 days) of paid vacation days, this is in addition to public holidays which varies by state from anywhere between 10 days in Western Australia to 13 days in Victoria.

\- While Australia used to have tuition free University thanks to Gough Whitlam's Labor government in the 70s, they later changed to college being paid through tuition fees under Bob Hawke's labor government. However the system put in place to get loans for education wasn't the worst thing, under the HECS loan system the debt you take is interest free and only requires repayment once you make over $47,014 AUD starting from 1% of income and it has a progressive tax income bracket which ramps up to 10% of income once you make over $137,898 AUD a year. The only adjustment made yearly to the loan is an indexation to the consumer price index (CPI) in order to keep the loans real value throughout time as it relate to cost of living, however the loans are all interest free so that is the only adjustment done. These loans also get written off in the event of death. It's not free education but as a loan repayment system, it's definitely one of the much more sensible models.

\- PHDs are free of charge to Australian citizens under the Research Training Program, so there's no tuition for PHD programs in Australia.

\- Every Australian is entitled to 10 days of paid sick leave, it all can add up through years so it doesn't go away if not used.

\- Australia has paid maternity leave which lasts for 18 weeks long along with 2 weeks of paid paternity leave for fathers, all of which is paid out at the national minimum wage in Australia.

\- Childcare in Australia is subsidized on a federal level, 85% of the cost is subsidized for families with incomes below $70,015 AUD, over $170,015 AUD the subsidy is 50%, over $344,305 AUD the subsidy is 20% and beyond $353,680 AUD the subsidies cut off.

\- Australia's minimum wage is currently $20.33 AUD an hour and is reviewed every year by the fair work commission who both review and adjust the minimum wage on a yearly basis.

\- Australia requires employees get paid a higher rate when given overtime as well as given advance notice of any overtime and bars employers from having overtime risk the employees health or personal responsibilities, employees are also given the right to refuse unreasonable overtime if they don't meet the many factors laid out in the law, all these factors are laid out in Australia's [fair work](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employment-conditions/hours-of-work-breaks-and-rosters/hours-of-work/when-overtime-applies) legislation

\- Australia has a child benefit system known as the Family Tax Benefit, which can be divided into Family Tax Benefit Part A and Part B. Under Part A of this benefit scheme parents can get up to \~$191 AUD for children up to 12 and \~ $248 for children up to 19 every two weeks, however this can vary depending on both circumstances as well as yearly income. Family Tax Benefit Part B is an additional benefit on top of Part A for people such as single parents, families with only one source of income, and this benefit can pay up to $162.54 AUD for children under 5, $113.54 AUD for children between 5 and 18, usually payed out every two weeks, however it can also be paid as a lump sum at the end of the financial year. Tax Benefit Part B also pays out an extra \~383$ AUD payment at the end of the financial year. All of these benefits are not taxable, making them even more beneficial for the recipient.

\- On top of all of those child benefits Australia also pays you $575 AUD when you have a newborn child as an upfront lump sum payment along with a newborn supplement of up to $1725.36 AUD over 13 weeks for your first child and $576.03 AUD over 13 weeks for each additional child. All of these payments are also not taxable.

\- Australia's retirement system comes in multiple parts. The first part is known as superannuation which was introduced in the 1990s under Paul Keating's Labor government. The way it works is your employer is required to put in a specific percentage of your wage into a superannuation savings account (the current rate is 10.5% of ordinary time earnings, however this rate will increase every year). Once this money is in a super account of your choosing, it is then invested by the account in a diverse array of sectors so that it can grow through many years. For Americans this is similar to a mandatory 401k investment system, except the entire working population has it. On top of superannuation Australia also has an pension system which is paid for through general income taxation and is paid out after you reach retirement age, the maximum payout can vary depending on your assets and net worth however the pension can pay up to $967.50 AUD for those who are single and $1,458 AUD for couples every two weeks. The other aspect of Australias retirement system is additional superannuation savings (which are encourage through tax benefits) along with voluntary private sector retirement savings.

\- Australia also has an unemployment benefit system which pays anywhere between $573.30 AUD to $862.10 AUD every two weeks depending on your situation. On top of this when you're on unemployment benefits you are also eligible for rental assistance which can rage from $95.02 every two weeks to $189.70 every two weeks depending on your situation. These are also funded through general taxation on a federal level so unlike the US, things don't vary as much state by state.

\- Australia also has a Youth Allowance system, which pays those who are in education/job training. For those in education and under 24 years old, payments can range from $313.80 AU to $577.40 AUD paid out every two weeks depending on your age and living situation.

\- For those 25 and older attending school/apprenticeship you can get Austudy which can pay up to $679.00 every two weeks, depending on your situation.

\- Australia has an interesting voting system, with mandatory voting enforced by fining those who don't turn in a ballot on election day. The way elections work within Australia's parliament are through voting for two bodies, the house of representatives, and the senate. The house of representatives are voted for through ranked choice ballots in single member districts, meaning that you can vote for whoever you like without fearing your vote being wasted, the terms for the house are a maximum of 3 years. The districts for the house of representatives are done by the Australian Electoral Commission which is a non partisan body, so gerrymandering isn't as much of a thing in the Australian house of representatives. The australian senate works in a very different manner using a proportional representation system, which means seats are divided up by political parties in respect to the percentage of the popular vote they get in a state. When you vote for senate you can also vote for either a party or for specific senate candidate within a party. Each state has twelve senators and each territory (which includes the northern territory and the Australian capital territory) gets two senators, the terms for the senators last for 6 years. Usually during each federal election 40 senate seats are up for grabs with the exception of double dissolution which occurs when the senate and house are in a legislative deadlock and the prime minister requests a double dissolution, as a result when double dissolution occurs every senate seat is up for grabs during the election.

\- Australia, like the US and Germany also has a federal government system. So states/territories have some control over how things go in specific states/territories. For example in the Australian Capital territory, it is legal to grow your own marijuana plants, something that is illegal in every other Australian State. There is even differences at a city level as well, such as the free tram zone in the CBD (downtown) of Melbourne where trams can be used by residents of the city within the zones boundaries free of charge.",Liberal

"Sharon Marcus - Fighting Bodies, Fighting Words: A Theory and Politics of Rape Prevention (2002) OCR'd text available here: [https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D85B0BSG](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D85B0BSG)

Introduction:

>In this essay I propose that we understand rape as a language and use this insight to imagine women as neither already raped nor inherently rapable. I will argue against the political efficacy of seeing rape as the fixed reality of women's lives, against an identity politics which defines women by our violability, and for a shift of scene from rape and its aftermath to rape situations themselves and to rape prevention. Many current theories of rape present rape as an inevitable material fact of life and assume that a rapist's ability to physically overcome his target is the foundation of rape.  
>  
>Susan Brownmiller represents this view when she states in her influential 1975 book, *Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape*, that ""in terms of human anatomy the possibility of forcible intercourse incontrovertibly exists. This single factor may have been sufficient to have caused the creation of a male ideology of rape. When men discovered that they could rape, they proceeded to do it."" Such a view takes violence as a self-explanatory first cause and endows it with an invulnerable and terrifying facticity which stymies our ability to challenge and demystify rape. To treat rape simply as one of what \[Mary E.\] Hawkesworth calls ""the realities that circumscribe women's lives"" can mean to consider rape as terrifyingly unnameable and unrepresentable, a reality that lies beyond our grasp and which we can only experience as grasping and encircling us. In its efforts to convey the horror and iniquity of rape, such a view often concurs with masculinist culture in its designation of rape as a fate worse than, or tantamount to, death; the apocalyptic tone which it adopts and the metaphysical status which it assigns to rape implies that rape can only be feared or legally repaired, not fought.  
>  
>Feminist antirape literature, activism, and policy development on rape in the United States during the last two decades have increasingly concentrated on police procedures and legal definitions of rape. This focus can produce a sense of futility: rape itself seems to be taken for granted as an occurrence and only postrape events offer possible occasions for intervention. Although feminist drives to change the legal definition of rape, to increase the penalties for rape and to render the terms of a rape trial less prejudicial to the raped woman have publicized rape's seriousness as a crime, an almost exclusive insistence on equitable reparation and vindication in the courts has limited effectiveness for a politics of rape prevention. Quite literally, the rape has already occurred by the time a case comes to court; a verdict of guilty can in no way avert the rape itself, and no one has proven a direct link between increased penalties and convictions for a crime and a decreased incidence of that crime. The notorious racism and sexism of the United States police and legal systems often compromise the feminist goals of a rape trial.

"What do you think? Person A has a decent idea, s/he sells it to some rich venture capitalist and gets a business off the ground. A has created lots of jobs, many families are now depending on the fact that s/he undertook the extremely difficult path of starting or maintaining a job-creating business and A is now filthy rich. From this, the people A employs make him/her wealthy, but it is A who gave them the opportunity to work and earn money, not her/his workers who gave him the opportunity to create the business (the market that gave that opportunity).

Why is it that some people often say business owners exploit their workers, that for instance Amazon's workers should kick all shareholders out and own the business equally despite the fact that the share holders' capital and the founders' ideas are the source of the job opportunities the workers enjoy? Sure, some businesses mistreat their workers but is that enough of an excuse to take founders' lifetime sweat and blood?

The people who say ""workers, take over the company kick out those demonic founders who force you to work for their companies for 10 hours a day (for a salary at least in the west)"", why don't they instead say ""people, instead of going to look for jobs from the demonic business people we hate so much for being wealthy off your work, find 500 more professionals like you, brainstorm ideas, put in $5000 each (loans, savings, inheritance,...) and together start a $1.5 million company which you own equally and grow it or sink in debts together and as a plus, you have no CEO or manager, you do all democratically......."", doesn't this sound more just?

Future of Social democracy USA How long do you think until something resembling social democracy may occur in the us? With recent events I’ve increasingly come to believe that it may take more than 20 years at a minimum for this to occur even basic things like universal healthcare via public option (forget m4a) seem unlikely within this decade. I originally had plenty of optimism for change from Biden but Now it simply looks like the consensus will remain. Now this isn’t entirely his fault (well most of the time at least) but it is disappointing. Additionally I think the increase in inflation and other economic problems (real or imaginary) will push it back at least another 10 years alone. I’m also increasingly worried of the republicans creating a stranglehold on the senate within the near future and they have shown no interest in even negotiating about improvements (despite what they claim). And this is coming from someone who doesn’t even Id as a social democrat. Sorry for the negative tone but I’m quickly believing that only something radical (whether democratic or not) will create necessary change in this country. Especially after trumps disastrous final year where he gained votes anyways. If you have any reason for hope/cope I’d like to hear it.,Liberal

"A champion for womens rights and feminism - Johanna Dohnal Hello fellow comrades, colleagues and friends

&#x200B;

as I was recently browsing my film inventory over at Apple+, I found a movie called *Dohnal* about the first Minister for Womens Affairs in Austria, Johanna Dohnal. A person to which I, as a man, can say with pride that I look up to. The respect she deserves for her work can not be described in words - showing a different view of the world in terms of equality and justice. A woman with the mental strength of several people - with humour and great politics, a figure loved and despised at the same time. And a woman that is for me the personified incanation of womens rights as well as feminism.

For that reason and to show that this sub cares about women and their rights too, I'd like to introduce to you: **Johanna Dohnal**.

&#x200B;

**Birth and early upbringing**

Johanna Dohnal was born on February 14th 1939 in Vienna with the maiden name Diez. She was an illegitimate child, a thing that would shape her very much. Johanna grew up at her grandmothers place in Viennas 14th District (also known as Wien-Penzing) while her mother either worked or suffered from tuberculosis most of the time. Another dimension was the war - she was six years old when the Second World War came to an end. Alongside this, the Nazi regime and the fight for survival of her granmother shaped her very much. In school, she was unique - she didn't know her father alongside her being illegitimate while the other children either had fathers still alive or dead due to the war.

Her grandmother was poor (dressmaker by trade) and got a small pension in her old days - a regular tale Johanna often told was the following: her grandmother would take a wet cloth and beat it on a Sunday morning  - so the neighbours would believe she'd prepare *Wiener Schnitzel* (which they couldn't afford). Her grandmother was ashamed of being poor, which was made worse by the war shortages and rationing after the war. Johannas seat in school was a wooden crate she couldn't afford to loose, as it too was used as the coal crate.

She went to *Volksschule* and *Hauptschule* (primary school) and began a traineeship as an industrial clerk (for her time a rare occupation for women) in a plastics factory, she later became *Betriebsrätin* (workers council member) in said factory. Although she was good at school and was keen on learning more, the poor living conditions denied her access to better education - another trigger that would shape her future way.

&#x200B;

**Politics and marriage**

Johanna Diez joined the then named *Sozialistische Partei Österreichs* (Socialist Party of Austria, the SPÖ) in 1956 at age 16. At first she was engaged with the local Kinderfreunde (a youth organisation of the party) as well as secretary for her local party section in Wien-Penzing.

In 1957 she married her first and only husband, Franz Dohnal - a tramway driver. Johanna brought two children into the world - Robert (1959) and Ingrid (1961). From 1960 onwards they lived in a *Gemeindebauwohnung* with 48 square meters. As they needed the money (her husband would shovel snow in the winter alongside his job) she returned to work very fast after her first birth, after her second birth she was fired. As there were no cheap child care facilities in her area, she stayed at home and did *Heimarbeiten* (home work) until she found another job in 1969 as a secretary for a locksmiths shop.

Her husband Franz was a classic man of his time - conservative in family matters. On a walk through the park with his family he lamented that his shirt wasn't ironed and missed a button, Johanna didn't care much about that. She never accepted her role a house wife - and showed her determination in matters of emancipation. She would divorce from Franz in 1976, the new divorce laws of Bruno Kreisky and his SPÖ government allowed that process.

&#x200B;

**Entering office**

Again in 1969, Johanna was appointed as Bezirksrätin (district council member) for her district as an SPÖ member leading to her being appointed as chairwoman of the *SPÖ-Frauen* (SPÖ Womens Section) for her district. One year later she would be elected as federal state secretary for women in Vienna with her office in the SPÖ Headquarters in the famous *Löwelstraße -* being added to the *Bundesparteivorstand* (Federal party heads).

From 1973 to 1979 she was a member of Viennas Municipal Council/State Council (Vienna is a federal state of Austria, so Municipal and State council are the same with the Mayor being Prime Minister of the state too).

Already in 1978 she showed her determination on a local level by founding the *Verein Soziale Hilfen für gefährdete Frauen und Kinder* (Association of Social Assistance for vulnerable Women and Children) which founded the first *Frauenhaus* (a protective institution for Women and their childred in fear of physical or mental abuse). That was the most known action of hers, she launched a lot of ideas and initiatives in her time in local Viennese politics that were often seen as radical. Like her campaign for better sexual education in Viennese school as well as improving social services, espeically for working women. Special recognition earned her campaign for legal abortion in Austria in 1974, a year later the law was passed after a hotly contested debate about it.

But said radicalism would open her a big door.

&#x200B;

**Frauenstaatssekretärin**

In 1979, at the party conference in Villach, she and three other women were appointed as new *Staatssekretärinnen* (Female State Secretaries). Johanna Dohnal was one of them, becoming *Staatssekretär für allgemeine Frauenfragen* (State secretary for general womens questions) attached to the *Bundeskanzleramt* (Federal Chancellory) under Bruno Kreisky. Kreisky valued the input of women very much - an opinion that surprised a lot of party members as well as Austria in general. One thing that surprised her was that the letter paper coming with her new office said *Staatssekretär* \- the male version - and not *Staatssekretärin* \- the female version of the word (a thing she soon tried to correct). Already in 1979 she produced some discrepancies with some men in the SPÖ as she was more radical than most women in the party. That was the reason she was put into the Federal Chancellory as the Interior Minister didn't want her.

In late 1979 she started work on a program for women in federal employment - to improve their conditions and gaining them more rights. At the second Worlds Women Congress in Copenhagen i 1980 she not only led the Austrian delegation but was Vice President of the Congress. This gained her international reputation as a very active womens rights fighter.

Her programs in her early time in office included improved birth protection laws for working women of all branches as well as improvements in family law, sexual crime law and social law in favour of women. Some particular achievements were the legal equation of rape outside and inside of a marriage, building a network of *Frauenhäusern* all over Austria as well as birth protection laws for female farmers (adding financial benefits).

In 1983, with the inclusion of the FPÖ into government and the change from Kreisky to Fred Sinowatz as chancellor, her job got a bit tougher. While Kreisky as quite open with women and their ideas of emancipation, Sinowatz and most of the FPÖ were more moderate on the topic. Still she achieved a lot as *Staatssekretär*. Said title was a point of deabte for her - she argued that it was necessary to introduce correct titles for women and not use the male term.

Besides her work on Womens questions she engaged herself in the peace movement of the early 1980s as well as in development (she was a fond supporter of the EZA - *Entwicklungszusammenarbeit* \[Developmental Cooperation - a program of cooperation between the First and Third World\]) and educational questions.

&#x200B;

***Frauenministerin*** **at last**

With 1986 came another change - Sinowatz left politics and Franz Vranitzky entered as Chancellor in coalition with the christian-conservative ÖVP in a *Große Koalition* (Grand Coalition), the first after 20 years - this time under SPÖ leadership. Vranitzky was sympathetic with the fight for Womens Rights and attended several press conferences, where most reporters were women. But some of his colleagues in the SPÖ weren't as sympathetic to this question as Vranitzky was. For example - after the introduction of the *Reißverschlusssstem* (zipper system also knwon as the *50:50 Forderung* \- meaning that men and women would be put equally on the voting lists like #1 a man, #2 a woman etc.) which she heavily promoted, some said to Vranktzky that its realisation won't happen anyway (jokes on them, it did).

1987 would be another great milestone for Johanna Dohnal - becoming *Bundesfrauenvorsitzende* (Federal Womens Chair) of the party, the highest office for Womens Rights and Questions in the party itself. Alongside this, she too was appointed to the post of *stellvertretende Bundesparteivorsitzende* (Deputy Party Chair Woman) for the SPÖ.

After the election of 1990 and some pressure on Vranitzky, the position of *Bundesministerin für Frauenangelegenheiten* (Federal Minister for Womens Affairs) was established with Johanna Dohnal as first *Minister* \- again the male term on the official letter paper. This proved as a great achievement for women in Austria. Her focus as Minster was on the question of compatibility of family work and job, working towards equality between men and women as well as protection against physical/mental abuse and violence against women. Introducing laws against sexual harassment, ending the *Amtsvormundschaft* (agengy guardianship) for unmarried women, stronger protection against abuse and violence were introduced in the early 1990s under her term. Adding to these came equal treatment laws for public service, a *Frauenquote* (womens quota) in Universities and Minstries.

In her time as *Staatssekretärin* as well as *Ministerin* she was a loved figure not only by most party members, but by a lot of people in general. But she attracted hate as well - she had passionate debates on television with lawyers and mostly stubborn men. Surprisingly, she handled this all with a cool and rational mind, always seeking to enhance the role of feminism. She had a great international following, a good friend of hers was Alice Schwarzer, the famous editor of the German female magazine *Emma*.

Johanna Dohnal enjoyed the party a lot, especially the sense of solidarity and cooperation. As some traditions died in the late 1980s/early 1990s like using the greeting *Freundschaft* (meaning friendship), this hurt her quite a bit. Her sense for Socialism was very strong.

In the early 1990s she worked quite well with the Family Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat (ÖVP), cooperating on a grand scale against the beliefs of Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek (ÖVP). Both showed that their mutual interests were stronger than their party divides.

&#x200B;

**Forced out**

With the rise of Jörg Haiders radical right FPÖ in the early 1990s, the winds changed towards a more conservative view. Johanna Dohnal and her programs faced more headwinds in society with the rise of neoliberalism making her work even harder to do, she couldn't stem against the tide much longer.

In late 1994, after another election, Vranitzky and Dohnal talked about her possible resignation. She said that she wanted to resign in late 1995 after the *Zehnjahresbericht* (Ten Year Report) of the SPÖ Frauen and the World Womens Congress in Beijing.

But she was denied to choose the time of her own resignation. On April 6th 1995, as part of a Government Reshuffle, she was forced out of office by Vranitzky. Until the autumn of 1995 she resigned from all political posts and went into private life with her fiance Annemarie Aufreiter, with which she entered a Lebensgemeinschaft (weaker form of Civil Union) in 1981.

&#x200B;

**Later life and death**

Even after politics, she still heavily engaged with feminist topics as well as questions of social and human rights issues. For instance, she was part of the *Frauenvolksbegehren* (Womens Popular Petition) of 1997 \[my year of birth\], launched by the group Unabhängiges Frauenforum (Independent Womens Forum). The petition was signed by 645.000 people (from a population of close to 8 million), a resounding success. From the 18 points of improvement, drafted after the Petition was discussed in the *Nationalrat* (Austrian Parliament), only two of which were realised until 2018.

Although she never attended higher education, she made several lectures on feminism at Innsbruck University as well as the University of Vienna. One of her greatest honours was the title of *Professor*, awarded by the Federal President Heinz Fischer, in 2009.

In January 2010 she entered a *Eingetragene Partnerschaft* (Civil Union) with Annemarie Aufreiter, soom after the *Eingetragene Partnerschaft-Gesetz* (Civil Union Law) went into effect on January 1st 2010. Johanna Dohnal never really spoke much about her lesbian relationship in public, most learned of it when she married Annemarie. She thought that she couldn't bare that on her women as they wouldn't understand it in the 1980s.

The Civil Union was her last honour that she was able to see alive. On February 20th 2010 Johanna Dohnal died aged 71 after long heart complications (she was well known for her chain smoking) in Mittergrabern, Lower Austria. She was cremated and her urn buried at Viennas Zentralfriedhof, close to her female party colleagues and legends Rosa Jochmann and Hertha Firnberg. At the farewell ceremony, a lot of people praised her - in the public the sadness was great. Even her enemies in life showed her a ton of gratitute after her passing.

Annemarie, who still lives, tried to get a widows pension - but was denied as she was united only for a few weeks with Johanna.

&#x200B;

**Honors**

In September 2011, a *Gemeindebau* (Municipality Building) in Penzing was named after her as *Johanna-Dohnal-Hof*.

In 2012, after a decision of the city council from 2011, a park in Wien-Mariahilf (6. *Bezirk* \- 6th Disctrict) was named Johanna-Dohnal-Platz.

In her lifetime, the SPÖ founded the *Johanna-Dohnal-Stipendien* for students and the *Johanna-Dohnal-Förderpreis* (Funding Prize) for scientific works on Feminism. Adding to that, in 2005 she was awarded as *Bürgerin der Stadt Wien* (Citizen of the City of Vienna, an honorary award).

&#x200B;

**Famous Quotes**

*""Aus taktischen Gründen leise zu treten, hat sich noch immer als Fehler erwiesen.""* (Stepping quiet for tactial reasons always proved to be a mistake)

*„Ich denke, es ist Zeit, daran zu erinnern: Die Vision des Feminismus ist nicht eine ‚weibliche Zukunft‘. Es ist eine menschliche Zukunft. Ohne Rollenzwänge, ohne Macht- und Gewaltverhältnisse, ohne Männerbündelei und Weiblichkeitswahn.“* (I think it is time to remind people: the vision of feminism ain't a ""female future"". It is a human future. Without role coercion, without power or vioelnt measures, without male bundeling and femininity delusions)

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

Johanna Dohnal constituted and still constitutes a great role in Feminism and Womens Rights in Austria even today. Her tireless work for a more emancipated society still bears fruits and she is part of a great line of female Social Democratic legends like Hertha Firnberg, Marie Jahoda, Rosa Jochmann and our current party leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner. Her unshaking belief in Democratic Socialism/Social Democracy makes her so special, even now and something I admire much about her.

Personally I have the highest respect for the work and life of Johanna Dohnal and see her not only as a role model for me as a man, but as an idol. Her endless work and idealism, the oppositon she often enough faced, the cool and calmness she retained against all odds is not only admirable, but borders the region of legend for me. Feminism for me has a great role in Social Democracy - as it is not only the emancipation of women in society, but shows one of our foundations, justice and equality. Women can do a lot, therefore we need to strengthen the emancipation until we reach full equality. It is our solemn duty to work for this goal, so we can say one day: no matter the gender, we are all equal in every societal aspect.

And although believe, that I haven't hugely benefitted from her work personally, I am of the conviction that Johanna Dohnal still lives with us and a lot of women in society - as a role model, as an ardent force, as a legend. We, men and women alike, will carry her ideas like a torch into the darkness to brighten it - and her ideals like a flag into a bright future for all! And knowing her successor as *Bundesfrauenvorsitzende*, Eva-Maria Holzleitner, personally, I have the firm belief that the ideas and ideals of Johanna Dohnal will live on with her and generations of men and women forever.

"Heteronormative And Homonormative Relationship Dynamics: ""I Wish I Was a Lesbian"" What do hetero women mean when they say stuff like ""I wish I was a lesbian"" could be translated to ""I wish I was lucky enough to have a significant other that actually understood me like you have"", or alternatively, ""I wish I had a relationship in which I wasn't bond to traditional gender roles and expectations"" 


What those rather heteropessimist or heterofatalist women are trying to say is that they wish they had a relationship with dynamics similar to those usually within or found in gay relationships, they want an homonormative relationship but lack the language to verbalize their feelings and thoughts, awareness and/or the possibilities of obtaining one.

If you didn't get what I am trying to say, I think homonormative and heteronormative relationship dynamics are better understood when we think of sapphic/lesbian couples as examples.


A relationship with an heteronormative dynamic is a relationship in which different divisions of gender roles and expectations are present and so are power imbalances based upon the presence of such imbalanced divisions, roles and expectations.

Different variants of heteronormative dynamics are found in hetero and queer relationships, the rather problematic, to say the least, traditional cis-hetero-conformative model of relationships is perhaps the most obviously visible example of such dynamics, but healthier variants of heteronormative relationship dynamics can also be found not only in butch + femme lesbian relationships, but also in role reversal hetero relationships, or other relationships in which gender roles division imbalances exists but are not forced or expected between the individuals involved in the relationship.


The opposite of relationships with heteronormative dynamics are relationships with homonormative dynamics, relationships in which gender roles either doesn't exist or, when they exist in the relationship, they are divided nearly if not equally, and therefore are not forced upon or expected from anybody involved in the relationship, while power imbalances related to gender doesn't exist for such reason, but other kinds of power imbalances may still be present when that comes to physical strength and age, for example.


Perhaps the most clear example of a relationship with an homonormative dynamic is that of femme + femme lesbian relationships, but such rather feminist gender equality dynamics are also found in butch + butch lesbian relationships, or among androgynous/genderqueer woman + androgynous/genderqueer man in rather genderqueer hetero relationships.


Also, please do not go down so harsh on people dissatisfied with their orientations, like the heteropesimist or heterofatalist women, as like if we all didn't share struggles, differently, but we all struggle from traditional compulsory cis-hetero-conformativity imposed and forced upon us.",Liberal

Is it right or wrong to hurt consumers to help prop up small businesses? Or am I misunderstanding something and this perhaps wouldn't actually happen?

"Should certain essential industries be ""exempt"" from the collective bargaining process? And when should the government, if ever, ""side"" with businesses? I notice the general sentiment here is that tripartite collective bargaining is ideal. Or having workers and employer negotiate regulations through interest groups (e.g. unions) with government oversight. This has been accomplished from social democratic countries like Norway and Sweden to more right-wing interventionist countries like South Korea and Singapore.

 I agree that this is ideal, but what of *essential industries* where such a thing could produce disaster? For example, the recent trucker's strike in Canada will likely make the supply chain mess we're enduring *worse,* and even if these truckers have valid claims they must continue to work or else *people will actually go hungry.* Similarly, I can't see collective bargaining happening in, say, ***arms manufacturing.***

I could see institutionalizing such conflicts through committees working - wage councils, employment forums, safety boards, etc. - as that's the method of tripartitism abroad. But this leads me to another question... 

Sometimes ***one side needs to win.*** And it's not always the workingman who needs to win. I'm sure most people here are pro-vaccine mandates, which is what the truckers in Canada are protesting if my analysis is correct. So naturally, the government should side with the employers who carry out the mandate. 

There's also the case of the UAW in the 60s and 70s, which demanded so much in wages and benefits that production costs were too high for automobiles - making such an essential product unaffordable for the commons. That is another case I can think of where the government should side with business owners; namely to tame unions when they *go way too far.*",Liberal

"Women being raped in the ongoing conflict in Tigray &#x200B;

Hello (M17), I am from Tigray which is where the Genocide is happening right now in Africa. This should be every humans issue but people are so divided these days I have to go around and request help from different communities. Women in Tigray are being raped. I have personally received a video of a raped Tigrayan woman in surgery and they removed nails and other foreign objects that were shoved in her uterus by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. [**HERE**](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2C20P0) is an article about it.

I have heard a lot of disgusting stories. But I have never seen anything like this. More than 200 are rape victims in one barely functioning hospital which was looted and only 5 of them have come forward in fear of stigma. Around 150 of them have contracted HIV which was the goal of the Ethiopian government. Now most of these women are going to die while giving birth or another horrible scenario. Those kids are going to grow up orphaned, HIV positive and probably starving if this madness doesn't stop. I have lost 2 of my uncles. I am not saying this to seek sympathy but to shed light on the Genocide that's happening.

I found out one of my uncles was dead on Facebook where there was this picture of his bloodied dead body and his best friends also dead surrounded by Ethiopian soldiers laughing at them and I didn't tell my mom what I saw to let her find out in a different way and she did. And anyone who has a loving mother knows what it feels like to see your mother grief, filled with pain. Now imagine the grief of those mothers that are literally seeing there sons being shot in the head or even worse getting beaten to death in order not to waste bullets.

**WARNING GRAPHIC SHORT STORY AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Eritreans and Ethiopian soldiers entered a house and wanted to rape this girl. Her brother said ""I would not let you rape my sister"" and they straight up shot him in the head with no remorse. And they raped her right there in front of her brothers bleeding lifeless body. She is the one that told this story.

Another one is ""Eritreans and/or Ethiopian soldiers entered a house where there was this preacher. They told him to rape his daughter or watch her get raped by them. I will not share the results of that situation as it is toooooo disturbing .

The women are suffering the most here. They rape and humiliate those women. Please donate what ever extra thing you have and if you don't, no worries just spread awareness about it.

"Can social democracy solve poverty and inequality? Or is socialism necessary? Obviously I recognize some see SD as a stepping stone for DS. For those individuals, please ignore my question.

Considering social democracy as an end goal, can it truly help ameliorate the conditions of the working class?

I see the fundamental problem with capitalism to be the commodification of labour. All other capitalist atrocities follow from this single premise - the inability of full time workers to secure their basic needs, let alone the unemployed, underemployed, incapacitated or otherwise unable to find not only full time work, but full time work at a living wage. If labour were not a commodity (as it is not in, say, a cooperative), then all workers would be given a living wage **and** be employed.

But it seems to me that capitalist economies - even with strong regulation and high taxes - are incapable of achieving this.

For instance, we can either have full employment or a living wage. Forcing employers to pay a living wage means less labour is demanded (again, labour is a commodity, thus subject to supply and demand), thus some peoplr are out of work. Again, I’m not ignoring the fact that employers may have monopsony power and that a living wage may be achievers run practice, I mean there’s clearly some limit to high high the minimum wage can be before causing unemployment, and *in principle* this means that it may cause unemployment if the living wage were above this threshold. Capitalists don’t care what the cost of living is. Labour is a commodity, remember?

Taxes cause deadweight loss too, so there’s effectively a ceiling to how much we can tax. Meaning a basic income and welfare is so solution either. Just a bandaid, really.

I get that unions could force employers to both pay a living wage *and* not fire their employees by preventing dismissals. But this doesn’t change labour demanded. In addition, unions are predicated on the assumption that management will magically bargain. I get strikes represent worker power, but strikes are often bad for worker and society.

It seems to me that social democracy simply cannot solve the fundamental problem with capitalism, and instead relies on bandaids that amount to not addressing any of the goals social democracy sets out to achieve.",Liberal

"Why the left needs to support existing socialism So this is gonna be a longer one. I see a nasty trend on the left of leftists condemning socialist countries. They go like DPRK is authoritarian. Or China is state capitalist. Or that Vietnam is capitalist. Little do they know they are actively destroying leftist movements. 

So what is actually existing socialist countries? Well they are what the name says. Socialist countries that exist. They have a left wing government and economy. Those countries being 
 
Laos🇱🇦, Cuba🇨🇺,  Vietnam🇻🇳  , China🇨🇳/🇭🇰  and North Korea🇰🇵

Some might add venezuela🇻🇪  and bolivia 🇧🇴 etc. And thats fair. These governments are in very early stages.

However many would argue to say these countries are not socialist but authoritarian state capitalist governments. Well most of these governments are marxist leninists ☭🚩. And the theory of leninism is vanguardism, dictatorship of the proletariat, democratic centralism and 2 stage theory.  So what do these terms mean? Vanguardism is a theory in which a left wing government takes power for the working class and acts in the goals of the working class. This means destroying the fascists and counter revolutionaries and socializing the economy. This stage is called dictatorship of the proletariat or dotp. Democratic centralism is an electoral system where labor union councils elect representatives who elect or appoint other people in power. Does it have cracks? Hell yeah you bet. But the thing is to fix it. This is a very grassroots level of structuring society. 2 stage theory is what i think is most important to talk about. So for marx and lenin socialism is a transitional stage between capitalism and communism. And for lenin a poor fuedal or colonized nation needs to pass through 2 stages to reach communism. Stage 1 capitalism. And stage 2 socialism. So lenins NEP was state capitalist. He gave peasants land and a market and thus private property to build productive forces. Now people throw that term a lot so what is it? Those are the physical conditions for socialism. Because marx showed that socialism arises from the ashes of capitalism and industrial society due to capitalisms ability to create tons of wealth this makes sense why lenin would develop 2 stage theory. And this makes even more sense why stalin said they achieved socialism. Because at least in my mind they did. They collectivized agriculture and industry and used the wealth from commodity production and used profits and surplus value to fund society. Thats why stalin industrialized so fast. Because when you work profits go to boss. Imagine if the 100 billion bezos made went into funding society. You would not need to tax income. Keep all of that in mind.

So now that we talked about socialism in a marxist leninist sense. And its ok if you have some disagreements you must understand the theory that these nations are abiding by. We can talk about why they need support and why they are socialist and how to break the cold war propaganda.

China🇨🇳/🇭🇰

Ill rapid fire these. One of the biggest concerns is China. Its so polarizing that r/socialism literally has a tag for this. This isnt prc related so i hope its not triggered and hidden into oblivion. You see many leftists fall for the red scare propaganda. And there's tons of it. And you have so much that people want to disassociate with it entirely. And its detrimental to the cause. So is it socialist? Well china has increased cooperative farming. And they have 5 year plans for their state owned enterprises. Their private sector is vast and foreign companies can only do business in the special economic zones. 57 percent of private sector is unionized and all state owned enterprises are unionized.  All unions belong to All China Federation of Trade unions. While it has not pushed collective bargaining in some areas. It does help keep wages up. The issue is because its tied to the CPC that it will fill the quota of the governments 5 year plans than the workers. And whats those plans? Well it is to industrialize and acquire more wealth and modernize. The bullet trains, producing more wind and solar energy than any nation. Fund schooling. And healthcare and social safety nets. The 2020 to 2025 5 year plan seeks to ditch the usa and become self reliant due to the hostility and cold war(prepare for economic decline my americans).The private sector has given clashes to the economy. Because the cpc has many ideologies (the socdems, the maoists, the progressives, the xi jiping thought people and liberals) it is always at odds. And because people dont vote some members in as they are appointed by representatives who were voted in it has issues of transparency and does bad shit for the people. This furious need to industrialize is whats harming china but its also leading it to prosperity. Did you know china has high homeownership rate? That means they are not renting or have a landlord. This is an objective good thing. They have only 2 percent hunger rate and have destroyed covid. Chinese people have like 7 degrees and they move to usa and become very affluent. This is the effect of structuring their economy this way. Use profits to fund society. Essence of leninist economy.  

So what does this mean? Its socialist in a leninist sense. And this is rhe 2nd world superpower. If you condem this with no nuance and feed into the bullshit you will aid in its demise. China is ussr 2.0 so lets not let it end up the way USSR did. Usa political economy is falling. We are losing wars. Countries are turning left like in south america and leftism is gaining traction in places like india. Plus if china falls the DPRKs only trading partner will fall.  Which leads us into dprk

North Korea🇰🇵

The DPRK is under lots of hate. You hear Kim Jong un is a dictator that enslaves and eats babies and that trains dont work and electricity is done and the people are trapped. Ofc this has no naunce. The dprk is a 3rd world country and has 3rd world issues. Im haitian and i have family in haiti. No electricity is pretty common. Its kinda shitty when ur on the phone with them and it cuts out cause haitian wifi is trash. But i digress. The dprk is poor no doubt but for a long time after the war it was actually outpacing the south in many regards despite 20 percent of their population being murdered, towns being leveled, and most land so bombed its not useable. And still they provide housing for most. Healthcare for all that was acknowledged by the WHO for polio elimination
https://www.who.int/dprkorea/news/detail/15-05-2018-who-and-unicef-support-dpr-korea-to-re-introduce-inactivated-polio-vaccine-(ipv)-in-its-national-immunization-programme-from-15th-may-2018

Is kim jong un a dictatorship? Well it depends on what thay word means. A dictator is someone with absolute power. So a Saudi monarch is a dictatorship. One in which the usa supports and in which is doing a genocide against yemen. Kim jong un is only leader of the workers party and the military. He does not do judiciary things nor does he create the laws. They have a constitution. He only plans the economy and the military strat.  So hes not a dictator by that metric. So no hes not killing political prisoners himself with his bare hands. Hes got judges who see if the prisoner should be killed. While im anti death pentalty just remember that almost half the world uses the death penatly. Including the usa. Which has more prisoners than dprk per capita. Well then one could say he has a cult of personality. I mean i guess to a degree. But i think there might be valid reasons why many people will fly his banner and praise him. Its like in russia that even tho stalin is dead he is praised and celebrated for his achievements. In short theres nuance.

About the economy. They are mainly a planned economy based on the soviet systems. Labor councils vote representatives that vote in people. And they help make sure the quotas are fufilled for the 5 year plan. The economy is collective and thus its socialist. I have my critiques of juche but i think it came because the need to build your industry is important. Leninist building productive forces. So if thats the case why are people starving? Its like i said. A lot of land is still shit and not even usable. Plus the sanctions. Before anyone says anything yes the DPRK asked for an IMF loan durint the 90s and the usa wanted it to starve and placed more sanctions. Its horrific. If you dont know that in the 90s there was a famine cause by a drought, a monsoon flood and the ussr dissolution. So many people died. Now they have bounced back but 35 percent still are food insecure/hungry and 60 percent are in poverty. Add on top of that the usa has troops stationed in the south practicing invasion for dprk and funding the southern military. So when usa media cries about dprk making nukes they cannot be suprised. Dprk was actually willing to disarm in 2018 but only if the usa did. And the usa did not want to. This is active warfare. Dont feed into the propaganda to destroy this country. Dprk wants to work with usa. It was willing to take imf loan and liberalize aspects like vietnam and yet it is the most sanctioned nation. Despite all that it is able to educate and give access to housing and healthcare to the people.

Vietnam🇻🇳

Vietnam i think gets less hate but is moreso called a capitalist nation. And as weve seen so far. Socialism is a transitional stage where economy is collectivized and there is dotp. China has aspects of it. Korea has it. And vietnam has it as well. Their private sector is regulated and its wealth is used to fund society. A lot of vietnamese citizens are farmers and they make up a lot of collectives. Very decentralized but cooperatives nonetheless. While its much more liberalized and the state owned enterprises are small only accounting for 40 percent of profits. That profit goes into funding society. Built on democratic centralism and nearly 70 percent of workers are unionized its apparent that it follows its socialist mixed economy. There is struggle but they are in process of constructing socialism. 

""Socialism is about making people rich and powerful... Socialism is to bring the people with freedom, prosperity, happiness, and chances of education, medical care, and good accommodation."" Ho chi Minh

Thats what they are doing. Building wealth and productive forces. And Vietnam is the fastest growing economy. Plus it has very low hunger rate, high home ownership etc. While the education and healthcare isnt free it is subsidized by the government. Making it mostly accessible. Liberalizing healthcare was one of the IMF quid pro quo in order to give the loan.

So i think this fits in the spirit of ho chi minh and leninist socialism.

Laos🇱🇦

Now i feel like Laos isnt talked about often. Like its the social reject of its 4 brothers and is not talked about in news. But yeah laos is shaky. Healthcare is not as good. Homeowner ship is way lower. Education is free but mixed for college. And a 27 percent hunger rate. During vietnam war laos was bombed a ton. And so they had to build their country up. It follows the same democratic Centralism. Decentralized economy with a mostly public sector of state owned enterprises. A nation built on unions it is a fast growing economy. All i have to say for now is time will tell. Laos is doing what it can to build productive forces and fix economic issues.

Cuba🇨🇺

This country is touted as a poor mess. While its poor i dont think its a mess. It has created its own vaccine and is the best economy in the Caribbean. It has one of the most strongest healthcare for a 3rd world nation and has more doctors per person. It has lower hunger rate than usa at 2 percent and a higher homeownership rate than usa at 90 percent. Higher life expectancy. And free education and medicine despite vicious embargoes. Now is it socialist? Well cuba has not liberalized and still follows a planned economy. 76 percent of the economy is state owned and there is mass unionization. It follows the leninist model of using the profits to fund society. They are also trying to push the private sector to be cooperatives. So i think its apparent that it is still socialist and is doing well despite the 60 year embargo. Because this nation was sanctioned to high hell and then invaded by the usa during the bay of pigs invasion. Is it authoritarian? Well i think that words a bit of a buzzword. Its authoritarian in tje sense of defense. And that can bring some issues. But you can critique the government. In fact during the july 2021 protests Canel went out to talk to protesters. What were they protesting? The issues caused by pandemic and the embargo. Before a color revolution was instigated by the usa. Its ability to defend itself is why cubas been able to hold out. Castro had 600 assasination attempts. And any spies and conspirators got the firing squad on them. Rightfully so(im against death penalty but if you are trying to bring back colonial landlords and sex slavers you need to die).

So all in all what does this mean? Should we defend everything these nations do? No. I just think we shouldnt condemn them and distance ourselves from them like many leftists do. I see Aoc and the dsa do this and its killing our movement. Are these countries socialist? Well if ur an anarchist then this wouldnt fit an anarchist definition of socialism. But if ur a marxist this does. Marx said socialism is a transitionary stage. And lenin highlighted this more. Socialism is not only people owning means of production. Its more complex and has many factors. Means of productions are public(state owned enterprises). Dotp protects workers rights (high unionization). Low hunger programs, free education, free or cheap healthcare. Housing initiatives and high homeownership rates. Industrialization. Economy built for collective good. This is what a socialist economy is. Fun fact on homeownership rate. The countries with highest homeownership are all socialist or ex socialist countries.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

A lot of the authoritarianism is just countries defending themselves. A lot of issues stem from countries being 3rd world. These countries are not state capitalist as the economy is public or structures for social good. Capitalism existing does not negate this. In marxs gotha program critique he talks about the stages of communism. In lower stage we see exactly what these nations are.

>What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. 

Many orthodox marxists will call out leninists as revisionist but marx says this exact thing. Socialism wont be perfect and there will be capitalistic aspects of socialism. But whatever the workers produce like food he shall get back in return like education or healthcare. Socialism is not shiny. I want people to know that. It wont be utopia. Its hard work. And all these nations are doing hard work. So we need to prepare for the american decline and agitate and organize. 
Solidarity with the actually existing socialist nations.

"The handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is scary Like everyone else I've been watching the Covid-19 pandemic spread everywhere over the last 2 years and basically obliterate daily life during that period. I remember when Trump was President and he was loudly, and rightfully, criticized over his handling of the pandemic by both Democrats and the public. What Trump did was flout most every scientific guideline on preventing the spread, gave minimal assistance to workers during the pandemic (a $1,200 dorito check, followed by a $600 skittles check) instead of the robust monthly assistance, medical care, and psychiatric care needed for a widely suffering population. There was, rightfully, an outcry over a ""9/11 a day"" when 3,000 people were dying at one of the pandemic's worst points in 2020. And people were rightfully disturbed by conservative rhetoric that we should get used to mass death and that well, grandma has lived a full life is it really so bad if she dies? Or, also conservative, rhetoric that schools should be reopened in the midst of the crisis. That was originally a Trump administration proposal.

It feels like since that time, everyone has lost their collective sense of reason and it's been thanks to an increasingly rightward shift of both Democrats and Republicans. Around 3,000 people are dying a day of Covid-19, right now, and you barely hear a word about it. In fact, what you do hear is treatises from the New York Times about how ""Covid is in retreat"" (apparently so, for the 19th time). Mass death has been completely normalized. Schools have been reopened in many locations with many kids and parents and teachers becoming ill with some dying entirely preventable deaths from Covid-19. Federal assistance has largely ceased with most people being herded back to work. It seems like many people are either too mentally exhausted to be outraged or care about what's going on and any outrage that still exists is focused on a minority of antivaxxers, or is focused on what public health measures remain in the name of ""freedom"".

If it wasn't for the vaccine, deaths in the US would almost certainly be far, far higher than they are. And those deaths have only happened to sociopathic government policy prioritizing the economy over human lives, both under Trump and Biden. Government policy that is still killing people over 2 years later.

It's very scary and I'm posting here in hope of some sense that I'm not alone in these thoughts and in these feelings. Solidarity",Liberal

"Right Wing Populism, the Possibility of a Right Wing 
Take Over and the Hope for Revolution in the US I think a little materialist analysis on the current state of US politics is in order. I propose a discusion thread here, in order to get different viewpoints.

During the 2004 presidential race the Revolutionary Communist Party had an interesting analysis. Basically it predicted that the Republicans would be successful in the theft of the election because hte Democrats would refuse to activate and call out their base into the streets election night. Generally this came true, Ohio was stolen, the Democrats, for fear of their base, and not wanting to begin a ""arms race"" of activist from both parties, as well as a fear of losing control of the base, they refused to call out their people.

Jump to the Obama election and there, they truly called their people out in every major city in the US. 250,000 in Chicago, 40k in DC, 50k in NYC, etc. THe Republicans had no hope of pulling off a theft of the election, major riots and a coup may have occurred. 

Thus the green light for calling out the most wild lunatics you can imagine was given. The right called them out. Groups like the OathKeepers (which many on the left seem to identify with, they are a group of active military that swear to uphold the constitution, in reality they decide the constitutionality of what they decide.) the TEA Partiers, and many others, the rise of rhetoric and populism has taken hold, mixed with conspircism and demogogary the proletariate have been bombarded with.

Does this constitute the possibility for a truly fascist takeover, either by the military in the US, or through continued legislation? Will that make it easier to activate and bring forward people to a communist world of liberation and the end of oppression?

"A proposal for a model of entrepreneurship in a market socialist economy A common criticism of market  socialism from capitalists is that ""You're free to start a coop in the  free market, if they are so great why aren't there more""

There are two reasons: 1) Lack of investment incentives and 2) lack of founder incentives.

The first is easier to solve: Crowdfunding, bonds, credit unions, etc.

The  second is harder. Because starting a firm take a lot of time, labor and  energy. Oftentimes firms are not profitable for years. But in a  standard worker coop, the founder doesn't get any additional kickback  for that work. So why would they bother to found it? That's where my  idea comes in:

You could do a multi-stakeholder cooperative like this: [https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/](https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/)

But i understand that is unpopular (every time I mention this idea on [r/cooperatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/cooperatives/) i get downvoted to hell).

So I have another idea (and it would prob be ok for software I think, which is the industry I plan to work in).

Use  an EOT or have a union and have it own like 90% of the firm, and then the founder owns  the 10% of the rest, with it written in the bylaws of the company that  this 10% may not be sold to anyone outside the firm/other than the  workers and that it cannot be passed onto to anyone else. When the  founder stops working at the firm, they will lose ownership of the 10%  and it is given to the workers. To leave the firm, the entrepreneur  sells the 10% to the workers, transferring all ownership to the workers.  The founder can still get paid quite well, and is compensated for their  initial work, their idea, and risk. The founder must keep working in  order to keep the stock, and if the entrepreneur wants to sell to the  workers at an earlier point, they can. The ownership will end up 100% in  the hands of the workers, however the founder gets a nice kickback and  an extra share of the profit for the risk, initial work, and the idea,  and thus are fairly compensated.

What do you think of this idea?

My  only concern is that by retaining that 10% the founder may be able to  exploit workers by taking more value than they produced, but if that is  the case I guess the workers could buy the stock or vote to kick the  founder out of the company, at which point they'd be forced to sell  anyways. So I don't think that is likely.

  
Edit:  


Ok so rethinking  this a bit. Instead of the founder starting with 10% let's say 50% (just for argument's sake, the number can vary).

The founder doesn't have to sell to the workers. They have a futures contract. So they can ""sell"" the stock to whoever, but the workers will get it by a set date. So the founder can still cash out. A model for this already exists in the futures market today.

"What is the Truth About Modern China? For whatever reason this just keeps bothering me, and I don't know why. I keep thinking about what China's is like, how their economy works, and my mind keeps getting this bad feeling, like for as much as everyone calls the country communist I can't help but get the sense the Chinese economy is far more capitalist and depraved than America's in a lot of ways, and their government is not the benevolent Confucian leftist government we ought to aspire to. But I really don't know, I hear from tankies and people I suspect might be tankies are saying all negative claims against China are all capitalist western propaganda, I've spoken to other leftists who say those tankies are incorrect, and I can't tell who to believe or what is fact and what are propaganda lies and I am atrocious at research, especially with something so complex. I come here searching for the truth, please help.

It's important to know that I understand that this does not apply to Chinese citizens, like anybody anywhere everyone is just living their lives the best they can, this has nothing to do with ordinary people on the ground. I also understand Chinese culture has different priorities than North American societies like the one I'm from, Chinese culture prioritizes the good of the community as opposed to over here where the individual is the priority, personally I'm of the belief that both should be in equilibrium and both of us could learn from the other but that's besides the point. The point is there are certain things like super invasive 24 hour surveillance that is seen as a good thing rather than oppressive, and all this is very important to keep in mind.

I hear of rampant censorship and media control going on over there, things like banning any criticisms of the state or depictions of trans people, gay folks, and men who show any amount of what the government deems feminine. Two stories come to mind as examples, both taking place in late 2019. There was an episode of South Park called Band in China, one plot involved the boys getting a movie about their rock band but the Hollywood executive as well as various Chinese censors kept telling them what they couldn't say in order to get the movie aired in China such as not saying America is a free country or whatever, the other plot was about Stan's dad Randy traveling to China to sell weed over there and finding out if he wants to sell weed there he has to suck up to the Chinese government and anything that displeases the government will get him permabanned from the country. This episode got the entire series banned, any trace of the show online even small mentions on chat rooms were scrubbed clean. Around the same time a Hearthstone player who went by Blitzchung won a tournament, during the interview he made the statement ""liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time"" the hosts ducked and covered as though a drive by shootout was coming their way and the stream was cut off immediately. Blizzard fired the hosts, banned Blitzchung from tournament participation for a whole year, and revoked his prize money, all to avoid the wrath of the Chinese government. After the backlash to what happened all that happened was Blizzard reduced the ban by 6 months.

I've heard about China's Belt and Road initiative, touted as a generous leftist project but is really a new form of colonialism. Instead of going in and taking over or installing a puppet dictator they gain good will as well as put them in debt, making those countries indentured servants to the state without them thinking or realizing it. Not only that but I see stiff posted in subreddits like r/democracy showing the leaders denouncing democracy and human rights, hard for me to believe that's a truly left wing communist state when the whole point of such ideologies is to emancipate people from slavery and suffering, not trade one form if oppression for another.

What also gets me questioning China's claims of communism is, as stated before, the way business is conducted over there. Now I've heard that wealth distribution is far more ideal within China, people have been lifted out of poverty, and billionaires are supposedly outlawed, folks like Jack Ma are in exile and though I don't agree with those methods I do agree with the idea of preventing wealth hoarding of course. Yet there's still a stock market akin to what western capitalist nations have, incentivizing hyper capitalist business models to please wealthy investors. Not to mention you have Chinese corporations like Tencent and Alibaba doing very sketchy business practices like data harvesting and monopolizing via buying other other businesses both domestically and abroad. Though it's not a product by either of those formerly mentioned corporations I can point to the games of Mihoyo implementing predatory gacha monetization in all their games, including their ultra poplar Genshin Impact, that's just one single example out of many. Yeah, very leftist indeed.

Then there's the story of the Uyghurs, I can't get the story straight. I hear about the enslavement of these people, but then I hear from thus one communist that the story is misleading, that it all spun from a poor BBC segment where they asked if anybody was allowed to practice their religion at the school and they said no and that got spun into a story of oppression when in reality it's no different than public school policies in North America, that there is no possible reason why the Chinese government would even want to enslave the Uyghurs.

Yet I'm not sure what to believe, as I said I've had tankies say China is a communist paradise and any and all negative claims about China are pure propaganda, none are even remotely true according to them, and any leftist who says otherwise has just internalized that propaganda, so that means Vaush is a complete rube according to these tankies. It's not far fetched to believe propaganda is being fed to us to oppose China, but I can't believe China is the proletariat paradise they say it is either. I've spoken to leftists who have said those tankies are nuts and delusional, that China really is an oppressive regime, one of them shared footage of this guy who was in police custody for saying negative things about said police in a chat room while drunk, poor guy was strapped down like he was Hannibal Lectern, being absolutely humiliated and forced to apologize, then they arrested him anyway.

The reason I want the truth is because I want to make sure if I ever have any criticisms for China I'm making proper criticisms and not saying anything untrue, I hate mischaracterization of anything, and as an aspiring artist I don't want any of my art to say something wrong. I also care about humanity, it's why I'm on the left, any injustice anywhere is my concern. Finally it seems like China is set to become the next world superpower as far as I know, I recognize I could be wrong, and honestly I'd rather world superpowers not be a thing but that's how things work right now, and I'm just scared that should they become the next superpower they'll undo any and all freedoms and human rights everywhere. I know America is the biggest threat to those right now, I'm under no illusion, and it does sicken me, but I fear what we do have will be gone with China calling the shots and any and all progress will be halted. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm being paranoid, that's literally what this is for, to clear things up, I care about the truth as much as I care about human rights.",Liberal

That's why I like democratic socialism/social democracy because it advocates for decentralizing power as much as feasibly possible.

The CCP, is a highly centralized powerful institution within China, and I think it's pretty hard to deny it is very authoritarian and not even close to communist (not that I'm a communist, just saying that the CCP is very much not). As such I am very opposed to many of the policies and actions of the CCP, such as the genocide of the Uyghurs, the occupation of Tibet, the crackdown in Hong Kong, restrictions of civil liberties at home and support for dictatorships abroad (see North Korea). It's authoritarianism is spreading, whether we like that or not and we need to have a coherent policy around the CCP.

The issue is an authoritarian governmental institution, not chinese people. I want to make that clear, and I'd ask that when replying in comments, be clear about the issue, it's the CCP, not China.",Liberal

"It really upsets me to see my friends getting married so young - what is this disgust rooted in??? So I'm originally from a small Texas town. It's mainly conservative but the population has grown immensely in the past 5 years and it's close to Austin, so you can find all types unlike other small Texas towns. Now I'm currently a 22 year old woman and at least a dozen of the girls that were on my high school dance team with me (Ages 19-24) are already married, some even with children. 

About a year ago one of my old close friends from the dance team got married kind of out of the blue. She had gone off to college in an actual small, heavily conservative Christian town, and naturally it followed she was engaged by junior year. I never even met her husband until their wedding day which was extra weird because I was close enough to the family to be in the wedding party. Now she's pregnant and so excited to be giving birth at the end of this year and just announced her pregnancy publically. And essentially everytime I get news of another engagement or pregnancy I feel disgusted. Not in the ""I'm afraid that I'm being left behind"" way, in kind of an overbearing mom kind of way. Like ""no babe you can't undo that decision and you still have plenty of time for family."" 

When trying to look around for women with a similar feeling, the only things I could find were the classic 'I'm 35 and single and seeing other people already settled down is hard because I'm afraid I won't get that."" I want to make it clear that I feel mine is a separate reaction, rooted in the exact opposite perspective. Not ""I'm running out of time"" but more of a ""what's the rush if you're so young?""

Part of me wonders if this is some kind of internalized shame but more specifically if this emotion is prevalent amongst other feminists? Like is this disgust rooted in me being secretly afraid that their adherence to an outdated social norm will force it back onto all women?

"What are your thoughts on a classless society? What do people on this sub think about the establishment of a classless society? Traditionally social democrats did advocate the abolition of classes and I'm curious as to what people here think.

For me I think a classless society is the logical conclusion for those who support democracy and as democracy requires equality amongst the people.

""I desire a classless society and the substitution of the motive of service for that of competition... Socialists do not propose to substitute the domination of society by one privileged class for that of another. They seek to abolish class distinctions altogether. The abolition of classes is fundamental to the Socialist conception of society.“ - Clement Atlee

"Single Payer Health Insurance in the US would unleash a wave of subsequent programs that would improve everyone's lives. America's healthcare system isn't the only aspect of national health that is broken. Affordable healthy food is also very hard to come by, especially when it's surrounded by many more unhealthy alternatives. Government dietary recommendations seem to serve the interests of Big Food rather than the health of the American people. Food industry lobbying money is everywhere. Getting single payer health insurance passed into law would unleash a chain reaction of self-reinforcing cycles of self-interest that would upend this entire cesspool of a system.

Implementing single payer health insurance makes the government directly invested in protecting their citizens' health and encouraging healthy lifestyles. The need to reduce costs while fulfilling their mandate will easily overcome the influence of the food industry. This would translate into actually healthy dietary recommendations, crackdowns on the use of blatantly unhealthy ingredients in mass-marketed food, subsidies for fresh produce, healthier school lunches, and regulations on sugary products. The end result is a much healthier and productive populace.

All of this would come naturally if we put all of our efforts towards passing single payer health insurance. We need to do that immediately, and we will all be better off.",Liberal

"RCP Joke Request Hi, everyone! I’m new to linking up with leftist groups (and this subreddit). 

Something weird happened recently when I tried to get involved with a leftist group. I found this nationwide abortion rights group that wants to mobilize people to protest ahead of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. I was super excited about that because I’ve been looking for an organization that wanted to do that for months. 

Unfortunately, I found out that this group is associated with the Revolutionary Communist Party. I now know that the RCP is headed by a cult-like leader. 

I’m so glad I found out about this before it was too late. I was literally hours away from printing and plastering their flyer all over town, which of course has a QR code that leads directly to their donation page. 

I am really shaken by the fact that I got close to shilling for what’s essentially a cult. I was hoping the lovely people here could cheer me up with some memes. I’ve read that Bob Avakian and RCP are the subjects of many great leftist memes. If you have any, I’d love if you shared them here. 🙂",Liberal

"How to make an impact, please!? I am very concerned about the power that certain fear mongering ""news"" media outlets have over not just a frightening percentage of our fellow country folk, but the difficulty that arises in finding common ground to participate/build/repair our democracy because of this. I'd like to believe that the average united States citizen would wholeheartedly denounce fascism, and I would happily support and participate in gatherings protected by the first ammendment to voice that. Though some extended family and many doing their own research in their news trough (feed) would assume I've joined a terrorist organization, as starting fires, looting, damaging property, and doing all the illegal parts of the insurrection on 1/6 is what is reported. Have also heard BLM called a cult, protests all described as riots and looting. When standing with an elderly group of people from the church next to me for a flash stance on sundays holding signs saying BLM, no justice no peace, white silence=violence, say their names, reform the police, the church supports BLM and some just saying love with a <3, we'd get flipped off, many yell all lives matter, a few obscenities and white lives matter.

Maybe I'm just hopeful and naive but there has got to be a way to break the hateful stereotypes and childish tantric rhetoric. It's so difficult to have a rational conversation when both parties think the other is getting false or misleading news, being controlled by fear and can't agree on facts.

• Where to spend time/energy to strengthen the future of democracy and conversation

"What is the difference between Socialism and Democratic Socialism?  There are many different definitions of *socialism* and *democratic socialism* out there. Many experts seem to disagree on certain definitions. On the Communist Manifesto, Marx refers to the terms *Communism* and *Socialism* interchangeably.

Some people view *Socialism* as a **diluted Communism**.

Some people view *Socialism* as a **transitionary state** **with** ***Communism*** **as an end goal**.

When we get into the gist of socialism, we of course refer mainly to the *proletariat* taking control of the [means of production and a planned economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialism.asp)**.**

What *communism* and *socialism* have in common would be:

\-The state being in control of the **means of production**

\-A **planned economy**

From some views, the differences between *communism* and *socialism* consists in:

\-There **still being** [**private property in socialism**](https://7esl.com/socialism-vs-communism/)

\-Small businesses could still operate (local stores)

From what I seem to understand, the [differences between socialism and democratic socialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcAQB3oPzt0) are as follows:

\-Democratic socialists **reject** the Marxist-Leninist concept of **planned economy**

\-Democratic socialists have ***some*** aspect of *capitalism* when it comes to *supply and demand*

\-Democratic socialists want to [**nationalize most key industries but not all**](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-socialism-and-democratic-socialism/)

\-Democratic socialists want **company decisions to be made by employees** [(workers' self-management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management)

\-Democratic socialists **do not want a one party state**, instead wanting a **full democracy with multiple parties**

I would like to know if there is anything I am missing or if I got anything wrong. I am seeking to get a better understanding between *communism, socialism and democratic socialism*.",Liberal

The   attack on the RSFR has caused severe damage to the Russian state, and   Socialism abroad. I regret to tell you that very many Russian lives  have  been lost. In addition the USSR was shortly thereafter dissolved.

But   always will the working class  remember the character of the onslaught   against us.  No matter how long it may take us to overcome this   premeditated subversion, the working peoples of the world in their   righteous might will win through  to absolute victory.

With   confidence in Socialism and in Communism, with the unbounding   determination of our Comrades, we will gain the inevitable triumph.

"I had to write a bill for a US Government project, thoughts? A Bill To Limit The Price-Gouging Of Pharmaceutical & Health Insurance Costs Through Profit Margin Restrictions

Written & Proposed By [Me]
All vocabulary can be located at the bottom of this bill.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that Pharmaceutical Drug Manufacturers and Health Insurance Commissioners should be regulated and restricted to a profit margin of no more than 30%.



Section 1:  This bill intends to enforce a regulated cap on the profit margin of prescription drug manufacturers and health insurance commissioners in order to limit price gouging. The profit margins of insurance premiums will be reduced to 30% (as opposed to 97%). The cost/retail profit margin of pharmaceutical drug manufacturers will be limited to 30% (as opposed to the median 75% ).

Section 2:  The regulation of drug prices will be limited to 30% of the wholesale cost in profit as enforced by the FDA. The regulation of health insurance premiums will be monitored by the NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners), and will be regulated by a new federal organization. This new agency will be named Health Insurance for All Americans (HIFAA) and will be responsible for enforcing and regulating the price margin cap on health insurance premiums.

Section 3: Health Insurance For All Americans will be funded and managed by their parent agency The Department of Health and Human Services and work alongside the FDA. For every insurance commissioner that does not comply a $1,500 dollar fine will be issued for every overpriced premium sold.

Section 4: This bill will be enacted January 1st, 2022.

Section 1a: Key vocabulary for this bill:
Profit Margin: the amount by which revenue from sales exceeds costs in a business.
Price Gouging: Price gouging occurs when a seller increases the prices of goods, services or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair.
Health Insurance Premium: A health insurance premium is an upfront payment made on behalf of an individual or family in order to keep their health insurance policy active.",Liberal

"""cancelling student debt"" supports a huge exploitative industry and should not be considered legitimate policy. I really don't understand how this has become such a popular policy. I am in favor of a massive expansion of public colleges, making public college free if you earn a degree, and making existing student loans 0% interest. But without the first 2, the last one and especially fully ""cancelling"" this debt will be extremely harmful. Doing this would reward exploitative private colleges and allow them to charge even more astronomical tuition which people will pay expecting their debts to be canceled again. This has what has allowed student debt to become so huge in the US. It's not the government not spending enough money, it's the money being funneled into private colleges, a process which will only be exacerbated by forgiving current student debt. Honestly, the government shouldn't even offer loans or federal assistance to people going to private colleges, as this money is basically going straight into the pockets of administration, and not hugely benefiting the people who receive this aid.

If you really want to support progressive policy, campaign for removal of interest from current student loans, a huge expansion of public and community colleges (California master plan for education implemented federally), free tuition for public college students, and the end of government money being dumped into absurdly priced private colleges.",Liberal

"I am having trouble understanding Steve Keen's criticism of the Labor Theory of Value, would love some help Hi,

I am relatively new to marxist theory (sorry), but I have long been fascinated by economics in general.

So anyways, I recently listened to this podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwavxl-w\_Z4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwavxl-w_Z4)

which interviews Australian Post-Keynesian Economics Professor Steve Keen.

I am currently trying to understand his critique of the Marxist Labor Theory of Value.

He starts to talk about it around 29:40 for those interested, and expands until about 35:00-ish.

Anyways,

This is my understanding, is this correct:

The use value of labor power is the value it can create, i.e. the value and use value of labor power are the same. This means, that the surplus value of labor is measured by taking the Exchange value and subtracting the value (use value) from it. So Surplus = Exchange - use.

The exchange value of labor is its wages, and its use-value is the value of the products it can create.

A similar logic applies to machines. Their use value is what they can produce. And the exchange value is the price of production.

Therefore they too can create a surplus value.

I asked this of a Marxist and the response I got was this:

>Machinery can't add any value because this constant capital will regulate the socially necessary labor time on a given market. Which means once every capitalist has the same technology / machine, the only thing that will regulate the profit / value creation is the abstract labor itself

&#x200B;

But I don't feel that really touches on the argument Keen is making right? Because Marx was using the whole use-value exchange-value paradigm to prove the labor theory of value right?

I checked the wikipedia and found this part, which I really didn't understand:

>Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of  machines to production is solely their use-value and not their  exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of  a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his  claim that the two were unrelated.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-57)  Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are  incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add ""more  use-value"" than it is worth in value-terms is a [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_error). According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of *human* labor.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-58)[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-59)  Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if  the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx  argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their  use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value; they simply  transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-60) Keen's machinery argument can also be applied to [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery) based modes of production, which also profit from extracting more use value from the laborers than they return to laborers.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor\_theory\_of\_value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#Karl_Marx)

Is my understanding of Keen's criticism correct?

So ultimately he argues that a machine can create a surplus. But,

>Machinery can't add any value because this constant capital will regulate the socially necessary labor time on a given market. Which means once every capitalist has the same technology / machine, the only thing that will regulate the profit / value creation is the abstract labor itself

means that it's wrong to say machines are a source of value?

"The Social Democratic Federation of the United States of America, 1936 - 1957 The Social Democratic Federation of the United States of America (SDF) was formed in 1936 by a faction of the Socialist Party of America called the Old Guard, in response to the rise of the ""Militant"" faction in the party, young radical members:

 ""*It all began with the formation of groups in the Socialist Party that wanted to commit it to direct action. ""Direct action"" means that an organized group will take any action, illegal as well as legal, that it believes will bring about the reform, changes, or objective it seeks. The general strike for political purposes, sabotage, the use of violence, the spread of fear, the paralysis of industry, trade, commerce, and even government are examples... The direct-action groups in the Socialist Party called themselves Militants; some formed the Revolutionary Policy Committee; others used other names. When they first appeared on the scene, they wore blue shirts and adopted the upraised arm and the clenched fist as a form of salute. They insisted that the party coin flamboyant slogans, organize street demonstrations, arrange great protest rallies, and in general, do the things that the Communists had made popular in their day-to-day activities. In due time, organizations of students, youths, tenants, housewives, and the unemployed formed by the Socialist group entered ""United Fronts"" with like organizations under Communist auspices. The fronts became transmission belts for the Communists... Most of the fronts sought to carry out the objectives of Soviet foreign policy, to glorify the Soviet system, and to spread confusion in the ranks of society. We were convinced that by engaging in United Front activities, we, who were opposed to Communist aims, would soon become witting or unwitting parties to the furtherance of those aims and to the destruction of democracy.*""  

The Old Guard called itself such because they believed they represented the Socialist Party's traditional commitment to democracy and reformism, and opposition to communism. In response to the declarations at the party convention in 1934, which the Militants had gained great influence in the party, the Old Guard formed the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, which would become the Social Democratic Federation. It affiliated itself with the Socialist International. Unlike the Socialist Party, which ran its own candidate, Norman Thomas, the SDF supported FDR and the New Deal. In 1957 it merged back into the Socialist Party, its ideas winning as from this point on the Socialist Party supported progressive Democrats rather than running third party in elections.",Liberal

"Are Norway’s policies replicable? Norway has a very standard of living (second highest median income by PPP in the world), very low poverty (5-6% relative poverty rate ie less than 50% median income) and otherwise a very egalitarian society.

However, it only seems to be able to maintain this degree of wellbeing because of oil money and an unsustainably large sovereign wealth fund. If every country in Europe maintained a SWF as large as Norway’s there’d be no private stocks left given Norway owns 1.3% of Europe’s stock market and only contains around 1.1% of Europe’s population. This means that Europe would effectively have to implement sovereign funds socialism to allow for each European country to maintain norway’s level of wellbeing.

Granted, if they did that would be cool and maybe it’s even feasible, but assuming it’s not are Norway’s policies replicable?

And even granting funds socialism proposals, how much of Norway’s success with de facto funds socialism is due to it’s oil money? They’re able to maintain similar levels of social spending while having tax to gdp ratios significantly lower than other Scandinavian countries.

Cassandra is the daughter of the Trojan king Priam and Queen Hecuba. Sister of Helenus, Paris, and Hector.

The god Apollo cursed her with a gift of prophecy which always was accurate but no one would ever believe it or remember it after. This curse turned out to be an example of almost perfect cruelty.

If social conscience is such that it is prepared to recognize the rights that the law chooses to enact rights will be safe and secure. But if the fundamental rights are opposed by the community, no Law, no Parliament, no judiciary can guarantee them in the real sense of the word. A democratic form of Government presupposes a democratic form of society. The formal framework of democracy is of no value and would indeed be a misfit if there was no social democracy. The politicals never realized that democracy was not a form of Government. It was essentially a form of society. It may not be necessary for a democratic society to be marked by unity, by community of purpose, by loyalty to public ends and by mutuality of sympathy. But it does unmistakably involve two things. The first is an attitude of mind, an attitude of respect and equality towards their fellows. The second is a social organization free from rigid social barriers. Democracy is incompatible and inconsistent with isolation and exclusiveness, resulting in the distinction between the privileged and the unprivileged. Unfortunately, the opponents of Ranade were never able to realize the truth of this fact.""

"Would laws preventing employer union busting efforts and maximizing employee bargaining power lead to greater union density? Consider the following reforms:

- ban employers from smear campaigns and union busting
- Allow the labour relations board to fine employers for labour law violations, and provide compensation to all employees affected by said violations.
- Allow the relevant union to organize economic sectors and legalize sector wide strikes.
- Mandate that employers provide a minimum number of paid hours per week for unions to meet with employees.
- Uphold and strengthen legislation requiring all employees covered by a collective agreement to financially support the union to at least the extent union members do.
- Independent contractors should be covered by all the rights guaranteed to regular employees.
- Employers would be banned from replacing striking workers with non-union labour.
- In the case that impasses are reached, unions could seek independent arbitration from the labour relations board who would offer final offer arbitration.
- guaranteed minimum income acting (de facto state funded strike pay).

These reforms would limit the ability of corporations to engage in union busting, as well as maximize unions bargaining power relative to employers. My concern is that none of this guarantees that unions would actually go out and organize workplaces and that the average worker would actually be interested in joining a union.

# Why is the US Corporatocracy so Keen to Remove Maduro?

While Venezuela’s economy is not a strictly-state-run economy, its oil industry is nationalized and uses its revenues for the benefit of its citizens (especially the poor).

After years of crippling US sanctions Maduro stepped over a crucial line in October when his government announced that Venezuela was abandoning the US dollar and would be make all future transactions on the Venezuelan exchange market in euro.

Saddam Hussein also went off the dollar in favor of the euro in 2003 – we started dropping bombs on him the next month.

A similar decision by the Gadhafi government in Libya (2011) was quickly followed by a devastating US-orchestrated conflict - culminating in Gadhafi's capture by radical Islamists who [sodomized him with a bayonet before killing him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUf6ypUz8LI).  Since then, Libya has gone from Africa's wealthiest country to a truly failed-state complete with a slave trade!  To make matters worse, after the collapse of the Libyan government, its military arms were smuggled out of that country and into the hands of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria - enabling US-orchestrated chaos in those countries.

# Who cares what currency a country uses to trade petroleum?

# Answer: US oligarchy

The US dollar is central to US world economic domination.

Like all other modern currencies, it is a fiat currency – backed by no real assets to prop up its value.

In lieu of a “gold standard” we know operate on a de-facto “oil-standard”:

""After the collapse of the Bretton Woods gold standard in the early 1970s, the United States struck a deal with Saudi Arabia to standardize oil prices in dollar terms. Through this deal, the petrodollar system was born, along with a paradigm shift away from pegged exchanged rates and gold-backed currencies to non-backed, floating rate regimes.

The petrodollar system elevated the U.S. dollar to the world's reserve currency and, through this status, the United States enjoys persistent trade deficits and is a global economic hegemony."" [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/072915/how-petrodollars-affect-us-dollar.asp)

Perhaps that is what the hurry \[was\] in removing Gaddafi in particular and those who might have been sympathetic to his monetary idea.” [Anthony Wile](https://www.thedailybell.com/all-articles/editorials/anthony-wile-gaddafi-planned-gold-dinar-now-under-attack/)

# US Foreign Policy is about Oligarchy Not Democracy

Since World War II, [the US has attempted to over-throw the 52 foreign governments](https://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list).  Aside from a handful of exceptions (China, Cuba, Vietnam, etc.), the US has been successful in the vast majority of these attempts.

US foreign policy is not about democracy – it is about exploiting the world’s resources in the interests of a small, ultra-wealthy global elite.

This exploitation benefits a small percentage of people at the top of the economic pyramid while the costs are born by those at the bottom.

# US CIA Coup Playbook:

**How to Plunder Resources from Foreign Countries While Pretending to Support Democracy**

1. Find a country with resources you want.
2. Send in an “[Economic Hitman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuAct1BxHU)” to offer bribes the country’s leader in the form of personally lucrative business deals.  If he accepts the deal, the leader will amass a personal fortune in exchange for ""privatizing” the resources you wish to extract.

If the leader will not accept your bribes, begin the regime-change process.

3) Engage in economic warfare by imposing crippling sanctions on the country and blame the ensuing shortages on the leader’s “socialist” policies.

4) Work with right-wing allies inside country to fund and organize an “[astroturf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)” opposition group behind a corporate-friendly puppet.

5) Hire thugs inside country to incite unrest and violence against the government in coordination with your opposition group.   Use corporate media to publicize the orchestrated outbursts as popular outrage and paint a picture of a “failed state” mired in corruption and chaos.

6) When the government arrests your thugs, decry the response as the brutal repression.  Use corporate-owned media to demonize the target government as a despotic regime while praising your puppet opposition as champions of democracy.

7) Work with right-wing military leaders to organize the overthrow the government (offer them the same business deals the current leader refused).

8) If a military-led coup cannot be organized, create a mercenary army to carry out acts of terrorism against the government and its supporters.  Portray the mercenaries as “freedom fighters” and their acts of terrorism as a “civil war”.

9) If the target government has popular and military support and is too well-defended for your mercenaries to over-throw: label the country a “rouge state” and wait for the right time to invade.  Meanwhile, continue to wear the country’s government and populace down using steps 3 – 8.

10) Escalate the terror campaign within the country to provoke a military response from the country against the US.  If they won’t take the bait , fabricate an attack or threat that you can sell to the US population as justification for an invasion.

11) Once the government is removed, set up your puppet regime to provide the illusion of sovereignty.  The regime will facilitate and legitimize your appropriation of the country’s resources under the guise of ""free"" trade.

12) As you continue to extract the country’s resources, provide intelligence and military support to the puppet regime to suppress popular dissent within the country.

13) Use the demise of the former government as yet another example of the impracticality of “socialism.”

# [‘Venezuela’: Media’s One-Word Rebuttal to the Threat of Socialism](https://fair.org/home/venezuela-medias-one-word-rebuttal-to-the-threat-of-socialism/)

[ALAN MACLEOD](https://twitter.com/AlanRMacLeod) FEBRUARY 8, 2019

A recent Gallup poll ([8/13/18](https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx)) found that a majority of millennials view socialism favorably, preferring it to capitalism. Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is the [most popular](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-poll-trump-favorability-a7913306.html) politician in the United States, while new leftist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (AOC) policies of higher taxes on the wealthy, free healthcare and public college tuition are highly popular—even among Republican voters (FAIR.org,[1/23/19](https://fair.org/home/ocasio-cortez-rattles-pundits-across-the-corporate-media-spectrum/)).

Alarmed by the growing threat of progressive policies at home, the establishment has found a one-word weapon to deploy against the rising tide: Venezuela. The trick is to attack any political figure or movement even remotely on the left by claiming they wish to turn the country into a “socialist wasteland” (Fox News,[ 2/2/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/venezuela-is-the-socialist-wasteland-that-ocasio-cortez-and-fellow-democrats-are-leading-the-u-s-toward)) run by a corrupt dictatorship, leaving its people hungry and devastated.

Leading the charge have been Fox News and other conservative outlets. One Fox opinion piece ([1/25/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dan-bongino-hey-ocasio-cortez-sanders-venezuelas-socialism-has-been-a-disaster-what-say-you)) claimed that Americans should be “absolutely disgusted” by the “fraud” of Bernie Sanders and Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, as they “continue to promote a system that is causing mass starvation and the collapse of a country,” warning that is exactly what their failed socialist policies would bring to the US. (Back in the real world, while Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez identify as socialists, Warren is a self-described [capitalist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-02/why-elizabeth-warren-still-calls-herself-a-capitalist), and Booker is noted for his ties to Wall Street, whose support for his presidential bid he has reportedly been [soliciting](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/wall-street-and-new-york-business-execs-gear-up-for-2020-presidential-election-.html).) A second Fox Newsarticle ([1/27/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-now-pushing-many-of-the-same-socialist-policies-that-destroyed-venezuela)) continues in the same vein, warning that, “At the heart of Venezuela’s collapse is a laundry list of socialist policies that have decimated its economy.”

*The* *Wall Street Journal* *(*[*1/28/19*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialists-of-the-world-unite-11548722544)*) describes calls for negotiations in Venezuela as “siding with the dictator.”*

In an article entitled “Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn and the Starving Children of Venezuela,” the Washington Examiner ([6/15/17](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn-and-the-starving-children-of-venezuela)) warned its readers to “beware the socialist utopia,” describing it as a dystopia where children go hungry thanks to socialism. The Wall Street Journal ([1/28/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialists-of-the-world-unite-11548722544)) recently condemned Sanders for his support of a “dictator,” despite the fact Bernie has [strongly criticized](http://inthesetimes.com/article/21697/democrats-president-donald-trump-coup-venezuela-juan-guaido-nicolas-maduro) Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and dismissed Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, as a “dead Communist dictator” (Reuters,[ 6/1/16](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-usa/venezuelas-maduro-rooting-for-revolutionary-friend-sanders-in-u-s-campaign-idUSKCN0YN32Q)).

More supposedly centrist publications have continued this line of attack. The New York Times’ Bret Stephens ([1/25/19](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/venezuela-maduro-socialism-government.html)) argued: “Venezuela is a socialist catastrophe. In the age of AOC, the lesson must be learned again”—namely, that “socialism never works,” as “20 years of socialism” has led to “the ruin of a nation.” The Miami Herald([2/1/19](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article225431885.html)) cast shame on Sanders and AOC for arguing for socialism in the face of such overwhelming evidence against it, describing the left’s refusal to back self-appointed president **Juan Guaidó, someone whom** [**less than 20 percent**](https://www.thenation.com/article/venezuela-coup-guaido-maduro/) **of Venezuelans had even heard of**, let alone voted for, as “morally repugnant.”

**This useful weapon to be used against the left can only be sustained by withholding a great number of key facts—chief among them, the US role in Venezuela’s devastation. US sanctions, according to the Venezuelan opposition’s economics czar, are responsible for a halving of the country’s oil output (FAIR.org, 12/17/18). The UN Human Rights Council has formally condemned the US and discussed reparations to be paid, with one UN special rapporteur describing Trump’s sanctions as a possible “crime against humanity” (London Independent, 1/26/19). This has not been reported by any the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN or any other national US “resistance” news outlet, which have been only too quick to support Trump’s regime change plans (FAIR.org, 1/25/19).**

**Likewise, the local US-backed opposition’s role in the economic crisis is barely mentioned. The opposition, which controls much of the country’s food supply, has officially accepted responsibility for conducting an “economic war” by withholding food and other key goods.**

**For example, the monolithic Empresas Polar controls the majority of the flour production and distribution crucial for making arepa cornbread, Venezuela’s staple food. Polar’s chair is Leopoldo Lopez, national coordinator of Juan Guaidó’s Popular Will party, while its president is Lorenzo Mendoza, who considered running for president against Maduro in the 2018 elections that caused pandemonium in the media (FAIR.org, 5/23/18).**

**Conspicuously, it’s the products that Polar has a near-monopoly in that are often in shortest supply. This is hardly a secret, but never mentioned in the copious stories (CNN, 5/14/14, Bloomberg, 3/16/17, Washington Post, 5/22/17, NPR, 4/7/17) focusing on bread lines in the country.**

**Also rarely commented on was the fact that multiple international election observer missions declared the 2018 elections free and fair, and that Venezuelan government spending as a proportion of GDP (often considered a barometer of socialism) is actually lower than the US’s, and far lower than most of Europe’s, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation.**

*The London* *Daily Express* *(*[*2/3/19*](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1081839/labour-news-jeremy-corbyn-jo-cox-venezuela)*) demonstrates that redbaiting works equally well on either side of the Atlantic.*

Regardless of these bothersome facts, the media has continued to present Venezuela’s supposedly socialist dictatorship as solely responsible for its crisis as a warning to any progressives who get the wrong idea. So useful is this tool that it is being used to attack progressive movements around the world. The Daily Express ([2/3/19](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1081839/labour-news-jeremy-corbyn-jo-cox-venezuela)) and Daily Mail ([2/3/19](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6662757/Corbyn-allies-rally-round-Labour-leader-Venezuelas-socialist-president-Maduro.html)) condemned UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for his “defense” of a “dictator,” while the Daily Telegraph([2/3/19](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/02/03/venezuela-labours-blueprint-britain/)) warned that the catastrophe of Venezuela is Labour’s blueprint for Britain. Meanwhile, the Greek leftist party Syriza’s support for Maduro (the official position of [three-quarters](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14303) of UN member states) was condemned as “shameful” (London Independent, [1/29/19](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-us-sanctions-alexis-tsipras-greece-support-a8751771.html)).

“Venezuela” is also used as a one-word response to shut down debate and counter any progressive idea or thought. While the panel on ABC’s The View ([7/23/18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW32S19vp0k)) discussed progressive legislation like Medicare for All and immigration reform, conservative regular Meghan McCain responding by invoking Venezuela: “They’re starving to death” she explained, leaving the other panelists bemused.

President Trump has also used it. In response to criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren over his “Pocahontas” jibe, he replied that she would “make our country into Venezuela” (Reuters,[ 10/15/18](https://reuters.com/video/2018/10/15/warren-would-destroy-the-country-trump?videoId=473661112&videoChannel=1003)).

The weapon’s effectiveness can only be sustained through a media in lockstep with the government’s regime-change goals. That the media is fixated on the travails of a relatively small and unimportant country in America’s “backyard,” and that the picture of Venezuela is so shallow, is not a mistake. Rather, the simplistic narrative of a socialist dictatorship starving its own people provides great utility as a weapon for the establishment to beat back the domestic “threat” of socialism, by associating movements and figures such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jeremy Corbyn with an evil caricature they have carefully crafted.

# Corporate Propaganda Blitz Against Venezuela’s Elected President: MSM Will Not Let Facts Interfere With Coup Agenda

[Facts Don’t Interfere With Propaganda Blitz Against Venezuela’s Elected President](https://fair.org/home/facts-dont-interfere-with-propaganda-blitz-against-venezuelas-elected-president/)  [Joe Emersberger](https://fair.org/author/joe/)

**Guaidó, anointed by Trump and a new Iraq-style Coalition of the Willing, did not even run in Venezuela’s May 2018 presidential election. In fact, shortly before the election, Guaidó was not even mentioned by the opposition-aligned pollster Datanálisis when it published approval ratings of various prominent opposition leaders. Henri Falcón, who actually did run in the election (defying US threats against him) was claimed by the pollster to basically be in a statistical tie for most popular among them. It is remarkable to see the Western media dismiss this election as “fraudulent,” without even attempting to show that it was “stolen“ from Falcón. Perhaps that’s because it so clearly wasn’t stolen.**

**Graph: Approval Ratings of Main Venezuelan Leaders Nov 2016 - July 2018 Data from the opposition-aligned pollsters in Venezuela (via Torino Capital) indicates that Henri Falcón was the most popular of the major opposition figures at the time of the May 2018 presidential election. Nicolás Maduro won the election due to widespread opposition boycotting and votes drawn by another opposition candidate, Javier Bertucci.**

**The constitutional argument that Trump and his accomplices have used to “recognize” Guaidó rests on the preposterous claim that Maduro has “abandoned” the presidency by soundly beating Falcón in the election. Caracas-based journalist Lucas Koerner took apart that argument in more detail.**

What about the McClatchy-owned Miami Herald's claim that Maduro “continues to reject international aid”? In November 2018, following a [public appeal](https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/14147) by Maduro, the UN did authorize emergency aid for Venezuela. It was even reported by Reuters ([11/26/18](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-un/u-n-approves-9-million-in-aid-for-crisis-stricken-venezuela-idUSKCN1NV2AR)), whose headlines have often broadcast the [news agency’s contempt](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-imports-exclusive/exclusive-as-venezuelans-suffer-maduro-buys-foreign-oil-to-subsidize-cuba-idUSKCN1IG1TO) for Maduro’s government.

It’s not unusual for Western media to ignore facts they have themselves reported when a major “[propaganda blitz](http://www.medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/2019/893-venezuela-blitz-part-2-press-freedom-sanctions-and-oil.html)” by Washington is underway against a government. For example, it was generally reported accurately in 1998 that UN weapons inspectors were withdrawn from Iraq ahead of air strikes ordered by Bill Clinton, not expelled by Iraq’s government. But by 2002, it became a staple of pro-war propaganda that Iraq had expelled weapons inspectors (Extra! Update, [10/02](https://fair.org/extra/what-a-difference-four-years-makes/)).

And, incidentally, when a Venezuelan NGO requested aid from the UN-linked Global Fund in 2017, it was [turned down](https://plataformalac.org/en/2017/02/global-fund-denies-humanitarian-support-to-hiv-people-of-venezuela/). Setting aside how effective foreign aid is at all (the [example of Haiti](https://haitiliberte.com/the-oxfam-sex-scandal-the-role-of-ngos-today-journalist-kim-ives-speaks-with-sharmini-peries-of-the-real-news-network/) hardly makes a great case for it), it is supposed to be distributed based on relative need, not based on how badly the US government wants somebody overthrown.

But **the potential for “aid” to alleviate Venezuela’s crisis is negligible compared to the destructive impact of US economic sanctions.** Near the end of the Miami Herald article, author Jim Wyss cited an estimate from the thoroughly demonized Venezuelan government that US sanctions have cost it $30 billion, with no time period specified for that estimate. Again, this calls to mind the run-up to the Iraq invasion, when completely factual statements that [Iraq had no WMDs](https://fair.org/take-action/media-advisories/star-witness-on-iraq-said-weapons-were-destroyed/) were attributed to the discredited Iraqi government. Quoting Iraqi denials supposedly balanced the lies spread in the media by US officials like John Bolton, who now leads the charge to overthrow Maduro. Wyss could have cited economists independent of the Maduro government on the impact of US sanctions—like US economist [Mark Weisbrot](https://therealnews.com/stories/new-oil-sanctions-on-venezuela-would-destroy-whats-left-of-its-economy), or the emphatically anti-Maduro Venezuelan economist [Francisco Rodríguez](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/12/why-more-sanctions-wont-help-venezuela/).

**Illegal US sanctions were first imposed in 2015 under a fraudulent “state of emergency” declared by Obama, and subsequently extended by Trump. The revenue lost to Venezuela’s government due to US economic sanctions since August 2017, when the impact became very easy to quantify, is by now** [**well over $6 billion**](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14073)**. That’s enormous in an economy that was only able to import about $11 billion of goods in 2018, and needs about $2 billion per year in medicines. Trump’s “recognition” of Guaidó as “interim president” was the pretext for making the already devastating sanctions much worse. Last month, Francisco Rodríguez revised his projection for the change in Venezuela’s real GDP in 2019, from an 11 percent contraction to 26 percent, after the intensified sanctions were announced.**

**The $20 million in US “aid” that Wyss is outraged Maduro won’t let in is a rounding error compared to the billions already lost from Trump’s sanctions.**

Former US Ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield, who pressed for more sanctions on Venezuela, dispensed with the standard “humanitarian” cover that US officials have offered for them (**Intercept**, [2/10/19](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/10/intercepted-podcast-vijay-prashad-venezuela-india/)):

>And if we can do something that will bring that end quicker, we probably should do it, but we should do it understanding that it’s going to have an impact on millions and millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat, getting themselves cured when they get sick, or finding clothes to put on their children before they go off to school. We don’t get to do this and pretend as though it has no impact there. We have to make the hard decision—the desired outcome justifies this fairly severe punishment.

How does this gruesome candor get missed by reporters like Wyss, and go unreported in his article?

**Speaking of “severe punishment,” if the names John Bolton and Elliott Abrams don’t immediately call to mind the punishment they should be receiving for crimes against humanity, it illustrates how well the Western propaganda system functions. Bolton, a prime facilitator of the Iraq War,** [**recently suggested**](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/02/01/yiiiiikes-john-bolton-threatens-send-venezuelas-maduro-offshore-us-prison-guantanamo) **that Maduro could be sent to a US-run torture camp in Cuba. Abrams played a key role in** [**keeping US support flowing**](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/1/30/allan_nairn_trump_s_venezuela_envoy) **to mass murderers and torturers in Central America during the 1980s. Also significant that Abrams, brought in by Trump to help oust Maduro, used “humanitarian aid”** [**as cover to supply weapons**](https://twitter.com/kgosztola/status/1091848921771638785) **to the US-backed Contra terrorists in Nicaragua.**

In the Miami Herald article, the use of US “aid” for military purposes is presented as another allegation made by the vilified Venezuelan president: “Maduro has repeatedly said the aid is cover for a military invasion and has ordered his armed forces not to let it in, even as food and medicine shortages sweep the country.”

Until that is understood by enough people, the Trump administration will continue to devastate Venezuela’s economy with illegal sanctions and push it towards civil war.

"My thoughts on the conspiracy theory issue in a lot of the west See I have an idea, but idk if it is the proper approach. Would love feedback.


One thing I have noticed (and prepare yourself for this truly shocking revelation) is that in times of fear and uncertainty people trends towards conspiracy theories which tends towards authoritarianism.

Let me explain:

Immediately before the rise of Nazi Germany or fascist Italy a number of things happened. The most obvious is the First World War which wrecked devastation on much of Europe at the time as millions of young men were throw into a slaughterhouse for inches of ground. This went on for four years. In Russia, the mishandling of the war on the part of the tsar, coupled with famines (which generated economic troubles, food insecurity, and of course fear and death). Conspiracies swirled about Rasputin's influence on the Tsar and as a result he was assainated. Multiple strikes and protests and mutinies were crushed. Then Lenin came back in and helped stir revolution. I am oversimplifying this a lot, but it helps prove my point in a brief space. Basically, the Bolsheviks, the most extreme socialists of the socialist movements in Russia at the time (remember, the first post tsar government in Russia wasn't socialist, it was the Kerensky government). In fact, the first of the socialist government elected in Russia weren't the Bolsheviks, they were the Socialists Revolutionaries (they were democratic Agraian socialists) followed by the mensheviks (less extreme communists, as far as I understand them they were kinda extreme classical soc Dems, they wanted to use social democracy to facilitate communism) and then the Bolsheviks. But Lenin didn't like that election so he overturned it.

Anyways, history lesson aside, the point is that in Russia, during a time of economic uncertainty and fear, people turned towards increasingly authoritarian movements. Sure, the majority wasn't necessarily in favor of the authoritarian movement (the Bolsheviks lost the election remember) but they were legitimized and had some support.

We can see similar trends in Germany and Italy. The NSDP at most had like 33% of the vote in actual democratic elections (feel free to correct me on that figure, going off memory). I'm sure you will notice, that's not a majority. But it didn't matter. People wrre scared, multiple failed communist revolutions had happened, the Germans lost the war and felt cheated by the treaty, oh and of course the economy collapsed because guess what? Global depression. So, in those times of fear and increasing number of people turned towards conspiracy theories about Jews, romani, and socialists ""who stabbed Germany in the back"" (this stabbed in the back myth is a key component of Nazi ideology). This is a conspiracy theory. This time about Jews and communists (to the Nazis, the Jews were behind the Bolshevik revolution).

Political division, fears of communism and again disappointment over WW1 led to the rise of men like Mussolini in Italy. I am less familiar with fascist Italy than Russia or Germany, but we can see similar fears and conspiracies about socialist and communists.

Ultimately you can see conspiracy theories rising in times of discontent.



My point in this is that, belief in conspiracies leads to a desire for authoritarianism in order to ""crush the people causing all our problems"". Russia did it, Germany did it, Japan did it, etc.

We can see these same trends in action now in much of the west. Conspiracies like qanon and the big lie are our ""stabbed in the back"", (trump would have won if not for election fraud by Democrats and elite pedophiles). Trump as our savior from elite pedophiles? Sounds a lot like older conspiracy theories that have been associated with authoritarian regimes of old 


So then, how do we solve this? There have been proposals to address the theories themselves but personally I think that misses the point. People only believe in these theories because of that fear and insecurity. It serves to magnify existing biases and prejudices. Sure, social media helps spread this stuff faster and wider but it isn't the root issue.

The solution to this is establishing security for people, economic particularly but also health (cause of COVID) and defense wise (see 9/11 truthers). Fundamentally, logical arguments don't get people out of conspiracies, this has been shown time and time again. Why? Because they are rooted in fear and identity, not logic. The insecurity drives the theory.

What do you think of my analysis? What specific policies are you thinking to solve this?

Regulation of social media, fox news and OAN, de radicalization programs, are stop gap measures to paper over the real root issue. Can they help? Sure. But the issue doesn't go away until we solve that fundamental problem. The solution is long term economic security.

"How to fix capitalism's problems with a just a single tax One of the biggest problems we face today is in regards to housing affordability.

To understand why, you need to look at price elasticity which falls into two categories: supply elasticity and demand elasticity. Demand elasticity has to do with how quickly demand will change in regards to price. For example, healthcare has an inelastic demand, much moreso than leisure. However, in a competitive market, that doesn't really matter. The problem comes when such a market is captured by one or a handful of providers. This can easily occur in a market with an inelastic supply because new providers can't easily provide more of that good. This is particularly the case with land which is about as close to inelastic on both sides as it gets. We need land to live and work on but land is a fixed good. Furthermore, not just any land will do because land in the middle of Alaska isn't as well desired as land in Manhattan or San Francisco.

There are three factors of production.

Labor: Effort by man to make or do something

Land: Anything natural such as natural resources or land itself

Capital: Anything made by man

Now the issue I take with this setup is that natural resources have more in common with capital than with land itself. Natural resources can't be made but they can be discovered. Even if it's non renewable, we can keep on discovering new reserves (that's why peak oil never happened). Furthermore, resources can be used more efficiently.

Land: Anything in fixed supply in which value can only be added through speculation. Examples include land, intellectual property, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and even geostationary orbits.

Capital: Everything else, mainly that which can be created through investment.

In the late 19th century, a man by the name of Henry George wrote a book called *Progress and Poverty*. In it, he sought to answer a question. The industrial revolution had given the US and UK so much wealth. Why then was there still poverty? Henry George's answer was that the ownership of land was the main culprit. His reasoning was that people (mainly those of affluence) were buying up land and gaining leverage over others. All of that investment in land left less left over for labor and capital. It wasn't just an affront to economic equality but also efficiency because land speculation hoards land from being used.

Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).

Henry George pointed out just how people can profit from land speculation without contributing to society.

>Take now... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: ""Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city—in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will in ten years, interest be any higher?"" He will tell you, ""No!"" ""Will the wages of the common labor be any higher...?"" He will tell you, ""No the wages of common labor will not be any higher..."" ""What, then, will be higher?"" ""Rent, the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession."" And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the *lazzaroni* of Naples or the *leperos* of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.

To fix this, George proposed a land value tax. It's similar to a property tax except it doesn't tax the whole property, just the land on which it sits. This would deter land speculation and incentivize land owners to use the land as efficiently as possible. It also wouldn't penalize upgrading property because it would only affect land. A whole movement started around it called the single tax movement. This movement competed with socialism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But for whatever reason, georgism died out. It's now seeing a slow revival in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which was caused by land speculation. Georgism saw sympathy from people like Albert Einstein, FDR, Hellen Keller, and Winston Churchill. Convincing people that this will be a good idea will most certainly be an uphill battle but enough people are talking about it, it can start a new conversation because we can't achieve the LVT if nobody's heard of it.

And the concept predates George. Thomas Paine in *Agrarian Justice* believed in implementing an LVT in addition to an inheritance tax of 10%. 2/3 of the revenue would go to people over 50 (life expectancy back then) with the remaining third in the form of a basic income.

Adam Smith was likewise very critical of land rent (that's where the phrase ""rent-seeking"" comes from).

We generally think of economic efficiency and equality as being at odds with one another but the LVT promises to bring us a great deal of both. Social democracy is a compromise between the forces of capital and labor. Compromise generally entails that both sides are giving up something to appease the other. The LVT ensures that both labor and capital win by taxing land.",Liberal

"A different thought on taking back control of female sexuality  

I posted this in another sub, but wanted to share here as well. The more I've thought about it, the more I view it more as a female empowerment issue vs. just a sexual issue. I recently traded private messages with another female redditor in another sub and it made me realize I want to clarify and vocalize these thoughts. I can be a bit extreme/out there in my thoughts sometimes, so here goes.

I recently read a book by Wednesday Martin called ""Untrue."" It was very enlightening and eye opening, but made total sense in light of the events in my own life. It was about the traditional views of women's sexuality and how they are all wrong.  I won't really go into a lot of details about this, but the long and short is, I am married to a man, but about a year ago I started opening up my relationship sexually with a female friend (with his full knowledge). Here are my thoughts of some conclusions as to where my journey has led.

We all know sex is a very powerful force in the world, and while it is and can be a very wonderful thing, it has also been used by men since the dawn of time as a tool of oppression and evil. I know there have been multiple books and essays about how women can use sex to their advantage in the power struggle, and this has always bothered me. It implies that we need to use our bodies to be equals with men, whereas men do not have to do any such thing. Although I fully support exploring ways to equalize power, I do not support a method that requires something not required of men. I suggest something a bit different when it comes to utilizing our sexuality.

I do not speak for all women, but my experience has always been that there is something very different in my relationships with other women compared to those with men. It's not something I can put my finger on, but it is a closeness and an understanding/appreciation that is extremely difficult to attain with a man. The common pitfalls I've had in my male relationships of gaslighting, having the other person wonder ""did I do something"" when I'm just trying to express how I feel, and overall getting me just aren't nearly as prevalent in my female relationships. My closest, emotionally tender moments in life have been shared with my close female friends. I don't think I'm alone, but I would guess a large percentage of women have been in those moments, and there is a moment, even if only briefly, where the lines between friendship/kinship and the feelings of closeness experienced in a romantic/sexual relationship are blurred. In my own life, I have taken those feelings to the next step and allowed that friendship/kinship to progress into sexual expression. Forget labels for a moment. Whether we are bi, lesbian, straight, or identify in any other way, I truly believe that taking that next step into sexual expression is a very natural thing that is a natural extension of the close feelings and emotions in friendship between women.

I really think the only reason this doesn't occur more is because of the world we live in and the stigmas that have been created by a male dominated society. If we could wipe our programming clean, I think these types of connections would happen way more frequently between women, and absent any male involvement. Here is why I think this is important. We are the gatekeepers of sex with the men who have caused the problems (for purposes of this post, I am not referring to gay or bi men who too have been oppressed). If women had more frequent expression of sexual desire with other women, it would do two things:

1. It would take much of the power out of men's hands. We would decide when and how sex involved a man. If we chose to, we would. If not, we don't. But if we were satisfying our sexual desires with other women, that might be adequate for us and we would not have a reason to give in to the patriarchal bullshit that so often governs sex. It leads to a very significant shift in the power dynamic.
2. My experience has taught me that sex with another woman can be very empowering. It is so different in terms of how it effects self-image and confidence. It has changed the way I think about myself and by extension has changed how I interact in my public life. It has nullified some of the confidence and self image issues that I believe are a product of a patriarchal society. I truly believe it would do the same for other women.

I know what I am proposing seems very much out there, and would require a total rethinking of traditional relationships, but I wish more women felt comfortable with this. There is so much we go to our female friends for: affirmation, openness, understanding, etc....why can't sexuality be one of those things? It just seems to fit so naturally into the order of things. It would change so many things as well. I realize many will look at this and say ""But I'm straight, that wouldn't work for me."" I grew up thinking I was 100% straight. Until a little later in life, I didn't give desire for other women a second thought, but I truly believe it's something that would work for almost every woman out there. I think there is so much more this could lead to. It would only strengthen the bonds between women in many different aspects of our lives (personal, career, etc.) and when we are closer and together, we are in a much better position to change the world.",Liberal

"Remembering Hiroshima, Nagasaki - U.S. Imperialist Mass Murder https://archive.is/TzjZn

Workers Vanguard No. 109 29 July 2016

Remembering Hiroshima, Nagasaki

U.S. Imperialist Mass Murder

Seventy-one years ago this August, some 200,000 residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were incinerated when U.S. warplanes dropped atomic bombs in the closing weeks of World War II. Many thousands who survived the nuclear holocaust suffered hideous burns and deformities compounded by sheer terror. This monstrous crime—carried out in the name of fighting for “democracy”—epitomizes the savagery of the capitalist-imperialist world order. Hearing the news of the 6 August 1945 attack on Hiroshima, which was followed by the destruction of Nagasaki three days later, U.S. president Harry Truman exulted: “This is the greatest thing in history!” and gloated that “we are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely.” The visit of Barack Obama to Hiroshima in May of this year was the first by a sitting U.S. president.

Our forebears of the then-revolutionary Socialist Workers Party (SWP) immediately condemned the bombings as part of their opposition to the U.S. and all capitalist powers in the interimperialist war. This position was coupled with the SWP’s unconditional military defense of the Soviet Union, a degenerated workers state. While the Stalinist U.S. Communist Party grotesquely hailed the A-bomb attacks as part of its craven support to the “democratic” imperialists, SWP leader James P. Cannon, who had been hauled off to prison along with 17 other party leaders and Minneapolis Teamsters officials for their principled opposition to the war, declared in a speech in New York City:

“What a commentary on the real nature of capitalism in its decadent phase is this, that the scientific conquest of the marvelous secret of atomic energy, which might rationally be used to lighten the burdens of all mankind, is employed first for the wholesale destruction of half a million people.”

—“The Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” 22 August 1945, printed in The Struggle for Socialism in the “American Century” (Pathfinder Press, 1977)

Cannon ended the talk with a call to build a Leninist workers party that would fight to “answer the imperialist program of war on the peoples of the world, with revolution at home and peace with the peoples of the world.”

The A-bombs created a special kind of hell. But so did the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo a few months before, which took at least 100,000 lives. For its part, Japanese imperialism had demonstrated its own barbarity by the 1937 Nanjing Massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese by Japanese troops. In Europe, the Nazi regime carried out industrial genocide against Jews, gays, Gypsies and others. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Britain slaughtered hundreds of thousands of German working people by firebombing Dresden, Hamburg and other cities.

U.S. atrocities against the Japanese population were prepared with the kind of virulently racist propaganda that the Nazis used to ostracize Jews and other so-called untermenschen on their way to annihilating them, and which the Japanese rulers spewed against Chinese, Koreans and others they subjugated. The U.S. capitalist press continually depicted the Japanese as “sneak attackers,” hurling venom against “yellow monkeys” or, in the snootier words of the New York Times, against “a beast which sometimes stands erect.” This poison delivered the message: anything could be done to this enemy. And it was long lasting. In 1995, the Smithsonian Institution canceled a planned exhibition on Hiroshima featuring the Enola Gay—the B-29 that dropped the first A-bomb—after a furious reaction from jingoists and militarists objecting to photographs showing the horrors suffered by Japanese civilians.

Official duplicity was the order of the day when on May 27 Barack Obama visited Hiroshima’s memorial to the victims of the A-bomb. Obama had made clear that he would not bother with an apology for the slaughter carried out by his Democratic Party predecessor, which would have been an empty gesture in any case. Instead, he displayed the lying, hypocritical cant that has been a hallmark of his time in office. Obama haughtily declared that countries like the U.S. with nuclear stockpiles “must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them.” Just a few months earlier, he had rolled out a plan to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next three decades, to the tune of $1 trillion!

Obama’s Hiroshima visit was part of a big lie. His amen corner in the U.S. media regurgitated the line that the A-bombs were what forced Japan’s surrender in the war. In fact, Japan was already on the verge of defeat when Truman learned of the successful atomic bomb test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. At the time, he was in Potsdam, Germany, for talks with Britain’s Winston Churchill and Soviet leader J. V. Stalin over the postwar division of Europe following Germany’s military defeat. The Red Army had smashed Hitler’s forces, at the cost of 27 million Soviet lives. With Soviet troops occupying half of Europe and poised to enter the war against Japan, the A-bombs were above all a message to Moscow of the lengths to which the American rulers would go to assert world domination.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied forces in West Europe during the war and later U.S. president, noted in a 1963 interview that the Japanese were ready to surrender and “it wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.” Washington knew from decoded cables that many in the Japanese government were looking for a peace settlement, but the U.S. insisted on unconditional surrender, thereby ensuring that Japan would not give in until the bombs were dropped. As we emphasized in “Behind U.S. Imperialism’s Nuclear Holocaust” (WV No. 628, 8 September 1995), “The A-bombing of Japan was in fact the first act of the emerging Cold War aimed at destroying the Soviet degenerated workers state.”

Washington’s purpose was further made clear by its ongoing attempt, soon to be successful, to develop a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb to gain another leg up on the Soviets, who the U.S. feared were about to build their own A-bomb. Moscow countered by developing a substantial nuclear arsenal, reaching rough parity with the U.S. in the 1970s. For decades, the Soviet arsenal helped stay the hand of U.S. imperialism. But following the capitalist counterrevolution that destroyed the USSR in 1991-92, the arrogant American rulers saw no obstacle to world domination, setting the stage for a series of wars and occupations from the Balkans to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Excluding the Soviet Union, World War II, like WWI, was fought between imperialist powers for resources, markets and spheres of exploitation. China was the special prize of the Pacific War. But the U.S. was denied that part of the spoils of its victory over Japan by the 1949 Chinese Revolution, which created a workers state that, despite bureaucratic deformation, remains the chief target of imperialist designs in Asia. Indeed, the main purpose of Obama’s trip to Southeast and East Asia in May was to firm up U.S. allies and quislings as they tighten a military ring around China.

In Hiroshima, Obama pitched the strategic U.S.-Japanese alliance, which centrally targets China and also the North Korean deformed workers state. Another piece of Washington’s Asian fortress fell into place in July when the South Korean government agreed to host the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system. Ostensibly a response to North Korea’s testing of new ballistic missiles, Thaad’s radar array can cover a broad swath of China, potentially degrading China’s land-based nuclear deterrent.

U.S. and Japanese workers must stand with China and North Korea in their efforts to develop nuclear weapons and delivery systems that provide a measure of defense against imperialist blackmail and attack. Defense of the remaining deformed workers states is inseparable from the struggle to sweep away the capitalist system, with its insatiable thirst for profit and its inherent drive toward war. In opposing the U.S.-Japanese imperialist alliance, we join with our comrades of the Spartacist Group Japan, who wrote in marking the 50th anniversary of the atomic bomb attacks: “Nanjing, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chilling examples of the slaughter and devastation that will be repeated in a coming war if the imperialist bourgeoisie is not overthrown by proletarian socialist revolution” (“Hiroshima, Nagasaki: U.S. War Crimes,” WV No. 627, 25 August 1995).

"Policy Idea: Mandatory Matched Strike Funds What if all employees had mandatory contributions towards a strike fund matched by the company, similar to UK pensions?

Each place of work had a local union to administer these funds. The fact that it's mandatory removes the free rider problem and the guaranteed existence of a well funded strike fund disincentivizes willingness of companies to hold out through a strike as they'd still be contributing. 

In a hypothetical scenario, company A takes 2% of all workers wages and puts in into a strike fund. The company then matches the money invested. This strike fund is administered by the democratic workplace union who can choose to affiliate to a larger national or sectoral union for increased resources. Employees are incentivezed through sunk costs to join the union. The union decides company A is low balling them so they strike. Company A still has to match up to 2% of their wages so employees contribute their own funds which are then matched and paid out to workers. Hired scabs are still mandated to contribute towards the strike fund and the company is still obliged to match their contributions. Scabs are therefore incentivezed to join the union and sit out. Companies are disincentivized from hiring scabs because they have to match up to a certain amount what they have to put in. Hiring costs disincentivize trying to bankrupt the strike fund and affiliation to a larger union will add additional money to any strike funds.

Edit: maybe add legislation that prevents temporary workers hired during strikes from benefitting from their strike fund, disincentivizing scab behaviour and preventing them from bleeding the original workers strike fund.",Liberal

"The solution to housing unaffordability As you already know, housing affordability is an issue. It is reaching the point where an entire generation may not be able to afford to rent or buy a home.

The status quo allows a certain group of people to gain wealth off of land. The issue is that land is in fixed supply and is absolutely essential for living and working. As a result, land has a perfectly inelastic supply and a fairly inelastic demand as well. This allows landlords to charge very close to what renters are willing to pay. There are also land speculators who make a profit from buying land and selling at a later date. Just to be clear here, land speculators make this profit without contributing anything to the economy.

Adam Smith is often heralded by conservatives as the one who invented capitalism. He had this to say

&#x200B;

[The quotes that conservatives don't tell are just as interesting as the ones which they do](https://preview.redd.it/ytfffgf8efz71.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0d7cedeed262d532f0c560867ef3f2e3f0380c3)

A major problem is that our tax system doesn't really tax this method of raking in profit without contributing to society. We have taxes on labor (income and payroll tax) and on consumption (sales tax). Neither of these taxes fix the problem because they tax wages rather than wealth. In other words, raising income taxes on the rich really affect the upper middle class the most. Capital gains and estate taxes are a bit better but they don't just tax land, they also tax all wealth, including improvements. If such taxes are too high, they may discourage investment. That's also the issue with property tax which taxes the land but also the improvements made to it. Property tax discourages land speculation but it also discourages more efficient land use since that taxes improvements to land as well as the land itself. In other words, assuming that land value is the same, a parking lot will see a lower property tax than a highrise.

There is such a tax which does tax land profit and it's called a land value tax. The LVT is similar to the property tax in that it taxes stationary property but it only taxes the land rather than anything built on it. It would incentivize more efficient use of land since that wouldn't increase the LVT like a property tax would. Imagine how much a certain property would be worth if it were just dirt, if the LVT were 10%, the landowner would be paying 10% of that every year. Because of this annual fee, land speculation is discouraged. If implemented at the state or federal level, it would also significantly reduce single family zoning because it would incentivize the same people who lobby against new development to reconsider as they pay LVT through the nose.

A land value tax ensures that the value of land is allocated efficiently for the good of society rather than being hoarded by speculators. Depending on how much revenue can be raised from the tax, it can either add to the current tax system or replace every other tax. The revenue can be used to fund basic government services and run a budget surplus or it can be used to fund a basic income.",Liberal

"Rant: Why do so many people overlook or downplay mass starvation or man-made famine when they're committed by the British instead of supposed 'Socialists' like Stalin and Mao? I constantly see people show the famines that happened in the USSR or PRC as Holocaust level genocides which decisively show why socialism is an ideology that starves innocent people, but incidents like the Irish Potato Famine or the Bengal famines of 1770 and 1940 are often swept aside as mere oopsy daisy events that had little to nothing to do with the British or their greed and neglect.

But not only did the famines in Ireland and Bengal were very similar to those caused by Stalinist mismanagement, but also the former were no less unnatural and man-made than the latter *(for example, the Great Bengal Famine of 1770 was in large part caused by the British forcing farmers to cultivate cash crops like tea and opium instead of food crops like rice.)*

So my question here is, why are two very similar instances of mass manslaughter seen so drastically differently?

Ideologues of Decaying Capitalism

The Bankruptcy of Liberal Economists

By Joseph Seymour and Bruce André

(Part Two)

This part concludes the article, Part One of which appeared in WV No. 1125 (12 January). (Part One - https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersVanguard2/comments/7qtzfg/ideologues_of_decaying_capitalism_the_bankruptcy/?st=jd5d5vnr&sh=1e01032c)

Economist Marc Levinson in An Extraordinary Time and his more liberal counterpart Robert J. Gordon in The Rise and Fall of American Growth both address the slowdown in the U.S. growth rate since the 1970s. Levinson at least recognizes that the slowdown was rooted in a decline in investment, although he provides no explanation for that decline. Gordon provides an explanation that is more apologetic for the capitalist system and even more pessimistic regarding future prospects.

Gordon’s implicit premise is that all progressive technological innovations—in the spheres of both production and consumer goods—have been and will be transformed into new, widely marketed (that is, generally affordable) commodities, although in some cases with a lengthy time lag. To paraphrase Voltaire’s parody of the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, with regard to technological innovation Gordon views American capitalism as the best of all possible worlds. If the possibilities for growth have diminished in recent decades, it is because the intrinsic character of technological innovations has changed in a way that diminishes their effect on productivity.

The structure of Gordon’s historical study of U.S. economic growth is based on the concept of three successive industrial revolutions. The first industrial revolution (IR #1) derived from inventions developed between 1770 and 1820, primarily the steam engine and its offshoots—railroads, steamships and the shift from wood to iron and steel. The second industrial revolution (IR #2) derived from technology developed in the late 19th century, particularly electricity and the internal combustion engine. The third industrial revolution (IR #3), beginning in the 1960s, was centered on new information and communication technology (ICT), such as computers and smartphones.

According to Gordon, the root cause of the slowdown in U.S. economic growth in recent decades was the diminishing effects of the second industrial revolution and the insufficient potency of the third:

“This decline in productivity growth by almost half reflects the ebbing tide of the productivity stimulus provided by the great inventions of IR #2. Its successor, the ICT-oriented IR #3, was sufficiently potent to cause a revival in the productivity growth trend to an average of 2.05 percent during the decade 1995-2004. But the power of ICT-related innovations to boost productivity growth petered out after 2004.”

Gordon never considers the possibility that some progressive technological innovations might not be transformed into widely marketed commodities because it is not profitable to do so. Later we will address his insistence that computerization and new digital technologies in general cannot significantly increase labor productivity in the future. In fact, he maintains that these technologies have pretty much exhausted their potential.

Here we will consider Gordon’s implicit assumption that all new, widely marketed commodities were more efficient than those they replaced and improved the living standards of the populace. In particular, let’s consider the partial replacement of electrified streetcars and subway and elevated trains by the automobile, which began between 1910 and 1930. Gordon analyzes the transition from one means of personal transportation to another in some detail. However, he does not attempt to measure their comparative techno-economic efficiency. Did electrified subways and elevated trains expend greater or lesser economic resources per passenger mile than Model T Fords? And if lesser, wherein lay the advantages of the automobile?

Gordon does acknowledge that the ascendancy of the automobile was not just the result of the workings of “free market” capitalism. Government policy was a very important causal factor:

“Government policies encouraged urban sprawl and undermined the financial viability of urban transit and passenger railways. Even before World War II, public policy was skewed in favor of the automobile by building streets and highways with public funds while leaving urban transit and interurban electric railways to operate as self-sufficient private companies. Many of the early roads were built by issuing bonds on which the interest was paid by local property taxes, so the automobile owner and transit rider paid equally to build a road system that made the automobile ever more attractive than transit.”

However, Gordon offers no judgment on whether government policies that favored automobile travel at the expense of public mass transit were economically rational and socially beneficial. Nor does he address why state and local governments pursued auto-friendly policies. The answer, of course, is primarily rooted in the capitalist drive for profits: The bourgeois politicians involved were beholden to the owners of the big car companies, like Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors, and also the rubber and oil companies that provided tires and gasoline.

Class Struggle and a Shorter Workweek

Gordon states: “This book is about not just the standard of living from the viewpoint of the consumer, but also the quality of working conditions both outside and inside the home.” In keeping with his main theme, that the American people experienced a qualitative improvement in everyday conditions of life during the first half of the 20th century, Gordon cites the reduction in the average workweek from 60 hours at the turn of the century to 41 hours by 1950. But his liberal worldview blinds him to both the fundamental cause of that important change in the lives of working people and the inherent limitation of its impact on their quality of life.

According to Gordon, the decrease in the average workweek resulted from an interest shared by business owners and their workers in having a rested and healthy workforce:

“Interpretations of the movement for shorter hours center on the widespread belief on the part of both firms and labor leaders that a reduction in hours would improve work performance and increase production. Higher productivity and higher real wages made possible a gradual reduction of hours of work, for the onerous demands of sixty- and seventy-two-hour work weeks had created an exhausted male working class.”

To back up his view, Gordon cites legislation passed during the Progressive Era in the early 20th century and the New Deal in the 1930s.

In fact, the 40-hour workweek was won through decades of hard-fought and often bloody class battles by the workers movement. Agitation by the nascent industrial working class for the eight-hour day and for unions led to the Great Rail Strike of 1877, which was brutally suppressed by the Army. In the 1886 Haymarket massacre, Chicago police attacked workers rallying for the eight-hour day and arrested eight anarchist labor organizers who were subsequently framed up and imprisoned or executed. In the 1937 “Little Steel” strike, whose demands included a 40-hour week, police killed ten workers near the gates of Republic Steel in South Chicago in what became known as the “Memorial Day Massacre.”

Today, after decades of one-sided class warfare by the bourgeoisie and givebacks by the hidebound trade-union bureaucracy, the 40-hour workweek has been substantially eroded. The average workweek for full-time U.S. workers has risen to about 47 hours, nearly a full extra eight-hour day per week. About one in five full-time workers toil 60 or more hours a week, while millions are unemployed or forced to work part-time.

Workers need to fight for a shorter workweek with no loss in pay, linking the fight for decent working conditions to the struggle for jobs for all. A 30-hour workweek at 40 hours’ pay, with the available work divided among everyone, would go a long way toward addressing both unemployment and the serious safety problems resulting from fatigue and understaffing.

The capitalists would, of course, reply that such demands are not practical—at least, not if they are to maintain their obscene wealth. Indeed, the felt needs of the working class run right up against the inability of the capitalist system to satisfy them. The solution will not be found in the struggle, however necessary, by workers for a slightly bigger share of society’s wealth against a capitalist ruling class determined to maximize its profits. The goal must be a wholly different type of society, a workers America where the productive wealth has been ripped out of the hands of the tiny capitalist elite and put at the disposal of the vast majority. Such a society can be achieved only when the working class, led by a revolutionary party, overthrows capitalist class rule through a socialist revolution and establishes a workers government.

On Labor and the Quality of Life

Like the class battles that won the 40-hour week, the steady erosion of this historic gain for labor since the late 1970s is for Gordon a closed book. Yet even if we accept his focus on the first half of the 20th century, when the workweek was reduced from 60 to 40 hours, this gain actually constituted something less than a qualitative change in the lives of American working people. While deploring growing income inequality in the U.S. in recent decades, Gordon does not address or even recognize a more fundamental inequality in all capitalist societies in all times: between the vast majority who have to perform what Marx called “alienated labor” to secure the means of subsistence for themselves and their families and the privileged few who can engage in creative, satisfying work.

In the preface to The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Gordon recounts that his interest in the changing rates of economic growth and labor productivity over the course of U.S. history goes back to his days as a graduate student in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid 1960s. The research for this book was undertaken to satisfy his intellectual curiosity, not because he had to do so to earn a living. But very few people have the luxury of working to satisfy their intellectual curiosity or express their creative impulses.

Consider, for example, the employees of Princeton University Press, who transformed Gordon’s manuscript into the printed pages of a book. True, they use technology that is radically different from that used by their predecessors in the 1920s, who set type for books by prominent academic economists of the time like Irving Fisher and Wesley C. Mitchell. And they work in more comfortable facilities. Nonetheless, they do the same kind of work for the same personal reason, to earn a livelihood.

Reading Gordon’s book, one would conclude that the 40-hour workweek and 11-plus-month work year, as in the U.S., is the highest possible level of organized society with regard to the necessary labor time expended by its members. However, in a planned socialist economy it would be possible, through a progressive, self-reinforcing increase in labor productivity, to radically reduce the total labor time necessary to produce both the means of production and articles of consumption. Within no more than a few generations, people would only be working, say, 20 hours a week and six months a year. Everyone would then have both the available time and access to material and cultural resources to acquire the scientific and technological knowledge that is now the province of a privileged elite. Projecting a future communist society, Marx wrote more than a century and a half ago:

“Free time—which is both leisure and time for higher activity—has naturally transformed its possessor into another subject; and it is then as this other subject that he enters into the immediate production process. This process is simultaneously discipline, with respect to the developing human being, and application, experimental science, material creative and self-objectifying science, with respect to the developed man, whose mind is the repository of the accumulated knowledge of society.”

—“Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy” (1857-58)

In a future communist society, there would be a vast expansion of the number of people capable of developing technological innovations on the order of Gordon’s heroes of the past, like Thomas Edison, Karl Benz (inventor of the automobile) and Guglielmo Marconi (a developer of the radio).

World War II: An Instance of State Capitalism

For Marxists, the most valuable part of Gordon’s book is his analysis of the “great leap forward” in labor productivity that occurred during the Second World War (1939-45) and carried into the first few decades of the postwar era. Gordon concludes: “World War II saved the U.S. economy from secular stagnation, and a hypothetical scenario of economic growth after 1939 that does not include the war looks dismal at best.” This was the one moment in modern American history when the expansion of productive facilities embodying new, more advanced technologies was not determined by the profit-making calculations of corporate executives and Wall Street financiers. In order to defeat its capitalist-imperialist enemies, the U.S. government—the executive agency of the American ruling class as a whole—directed and financed the unprecedented construction of industrial plant and equipment.

A standard economic history of the Second World War states:

“The period 1940 to 1944 saw a greater expansion of industrial production in the United States than any previous period.... Between 1940 and 1944 the total output of manufactured goods increased 300 per cent and that of raw materials by about 60 per cent. Investment in new plant and equipment, much of it direct investment by the government, is estimated to have increased the productive capacity of the economy by as much as 50 per cent.”

—Alan S. Milward, War, Economy and Society 1939-1945 (1977)

Government-funded factories and other productive facilities were turned over free of charge to corporate capitalists, thereby greatly increasing their profits both during and after the war. Gordon comments in this regard: “Though private capital input stagnated during 1930-45, the amount of capital input financed by the government surged ahead throughout that fifteen-year interval. Of particular interest was the creation of new plant facilities paid for by the government but operated by private firms to produce military equipment and supplies.”

Franklin D. Roosevelt and the other political directors of the U.S. imperialist state (for example, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau) were intimately familiar with the workings of industrial corporations and banks. They knew from firsthand experience that they could not depend on the normal mechanisms of the capitalist market to maximize the output of armaments in the shortest possible time. Big industrialists like Henry Ford and Henry Kaiser were therefore guaranteed profits through the cost-plus method of setting procurement prices. Their firms were paid whatever they claimed it cost them to build battleships, bombers, tanks, etc., with an additional markup for profit. Over the course of the war, the after-tax profits of industrial firms increased by 120 percent.

Far more important in its long-term economic effects was direct government financing of the construction of factories and other industrial infrastructure. Gordon emphasizes that the number of machine tools—the core component of an industrial economy—doubled from 1940 to 1945, and “almost all of these new machine tools were paid for by the government rather than by private firms.” Ford’s gigantic bomber-building plant in Willow Run, Michigan, was government-financed. Likewise were major pipelines, still in use today, conveying petroleum from the Texas oil fields to the Northeast. Moreover, the basic technology underlying what Gordon termed the “third industrial revolution,” beginning in the 1960s, also originated in the U.S. military during the Second World War. The prototype of the mainframe computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was developed by scientists and engineers, employed by the war department, at the University of Pennsylvania.

When the American capitalist-imperialist state maximized production, labor productivity and technological innovation, it was in order to bring death and destruction to other peoples. Arguably the most important scientific and technological breakthrough in the 20th century, the unleashing of nuclear energy, was used to incinerate the civilian populations of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Gordon Versus the “Techno-Optimists”

Gordon’s main foil in his book is an intellectual current he deems “techno-optimists,” who foresee new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence placing the American economy on the cusp of a wave of economic growth. Like Gordon, these techno-optimists (including Joel Mokyr, Gordon’s colleague at Northwestern University, as well as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT, among others) believe that it is technological innovation above all else that determines the course of society. The dispute involves two very different questions. One concerns the sphere of consumption in the present, the other the sphere of production in the future.

Gordon argues that the effect of the new information and communications technologies on the quality of everyday life has been relatively meager compared to the major innovations and inventions in the century between 1870 and 1970. Those ranged from indoor plumbing, electric lighting and central heating to automobiles, airplanes and television. Gordon writes:

“Though there has been continuous innovation since 1970, it has been less broad in its scope than before, focused on entertainment and information and communication technology (ICT), and advances in several dimensions of the standard of living related to food, clothing, appliances, housing, transportation, health, and working conditions have advanced at a slower pace than before 1970.”

At another level, the dispute between Gordon and the techno-optimists is over the “futurology” of the likelihood of dramatically transformative new technologies developing and being put into widespread use in the near future. Both sides implicitly treat capitalism as a system that best fosters technological innovation. Both, of course, write off the perspective of a collectivized planned economy as not meriting serious consideration.

In a 2014 essay titled “The Next Age of Invention: Technology’s Future Is Brighter than Pessimists Allow,” Mokyr rhapsodizes about supercomputers, 3-D printing, genetic engineering and the like. There is, however, no mention of wages, production costs, markets or profits. These basic categories determining capitalist production and investment in new technologies are likewise absent from his brief polemical response to Gordon’s recent book, “Is Our Economic Future Behind Us?” (29 November 2016). In the unlikely event that Mokyr becomes CEO of Apple or General Electric, these companies would likely face bankruptcy. If he followed his own prescriptions, Mokyr would use the most advanced and therefore most expensive equipment, irrespective of whether this elevated production costs above those of competing firms.

In his 2014 essay, Mokyr does advance an economic argument in the service of techno-optimism: “A second reason technological progress will continue unabated has to do with the emergence of a competitive global marketplace, which will encourage the spread of new technology from its originating locations to other users who do not wish to be left behind.” In fact, the extension of international trade and capital export hardly represents an unambiguous encouragement to the development of technology. In the imperialist epoch, the international economy runs up against the very nation-states upon which the imperialists base their power, constituting an obstacle to the further development of humanity’s productive forces. Production in Europe, Japan and some spots in Asia may use modern methods. However, the vast pool of cheap labor available in South and East Asia and Latin America tends to inhibit investment in laborsaving technology in both the Third World and the imperialist centers.

When U.S. and European industrial firms shift manufacturing operations to poor countries, they often tend to use less capital-intensive methods of production. Consider clothing manufacture. While the technology exists to perform this in capital-intensive, highly automated plants, it remains cheaper for companies to pay workers in oppressed neocolonies like Bangladesh pennies on the dollar to sew clothing in conditions that are closer to those of the 19th century than the 21st.

In First World countries, too, current scientific and technological knowledge is not used in a rational and socially beneficial way, and in many cases is willfully misused. Consider the field of medical research, where major efforts are made to treat baldness and erectile dysfunction while only a pittance is invested in new drugs and vaccines for potentially fatal tropical diseases.

In the U.S. alone, some 23,000 people die every year of infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A study commissioned by the British government reported that by midcentury as many as ten million people a year globally could die from drug-resistant bacteria if new treatments are not discovered. Yet despite the critical social need, most of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies long ago stopped developing new antibiotics, citing low returns on investment.

Likewise, some 25 million people in the U.S. suffer from so-called rare diseases, such as Lou Gehrig’s disease and cystic fibrosis as well as sickle cell anemia, which overwhelmingly affects black people. Yet investment in research on treatments and cures for such diseases is notoriously meager, even though rare-disease research has often uncovered fruitful pathways for treating and curing some of the most prevalent ailments. The Center for Health Journalism at the University of Southern California explained the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies: “Most say investing in treatments for rare diseases—ones that affect tens of thousands of people—does not make for good business sense.”

Disregarding the laws governing the capitalist mode of production, Mokyr, McAfee, Brynjolfsson & Co. project a quantum leap in productivity in the near future through the use of “brilliant technologies.” Gordon implicitly accepts the limitations of the capitalist system in denying the very possibility of such a development. With regard to robotics, he writes: “The exponential increase in computer speed and memory has apparently raced far ahead of the capability of robots to duplicate human movements.” Gordon offers no argument for why this gap could not be greatly reduced by future advances in scientific and technological knowledge. He makes no assessment of the resources currently expended on robotics research.

Most of the vast amount of scientific research conducted by universities is directly funded by the federal government, and the biggest chunk of federal funding is directed toward military ends. The U.S. budget last year directed $6.5 billion in R&D to the National Science Foundation, while the R&D budget of the Air Force alone totaled almost $27 billion. Research in the physical sciences, including robotics, even if at some layers of remove, tends toward the ultimate end of building better drones and other machinery to blow up things and kill people in the interests of capitalist imperialism. Mathematics funding tends toward algorithms for securing state secrets and operations while hacking into the secrets of others. The National Security Agency is widely thought to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the U.S.

At every turn, despite its thirst for technological innovation, capitalism is not the ally of scientific advance but its opponent. From intellectual property laws and the perverse incentives of the market to the tens of billions spent on more effective weaponry, capitalism directs research in the interests of the ruling class and its state apparatus. If those same resources were directed toward advancing human knowledge, furthering human happiness and putting mankind in control of its destiny, what could be accomplished is nearly unimaginable. This requires overturning the capitalist-imperialist system through a series of proletarian revolutions, laying the basis for a globally planned socialist economy. It is to lead the proletariat in that fight that the International Communist League seeks to reforge the Fourth International, world party of socialist revolution.

"Thoughts on Scandinavia's Luxury Prisons? Prisons in Scandanavia are nice, to say the least. In fact, they're almost luxurious. 

The Halden Prison in Norway, for instance, gives its prisoners (including murderers and rapists) flat-screen TVs, private showers and toilets, fridges, and live in considerable comfort. 

For petty nonviolent crimes like shoplifting, possession, misdemeanour, etc, it makes a lot more sense. A handful of prisoners currently languishing in American super prisons aren't bad people and don't deserve the kind of treatment they get.

 I'm in favour of major sentencing and incarceration reform for petty crime and drug charges, but turning all prisons into the Ritz Carleton is a stretch. The idea of murderers and rapists being mollycoddled while luxuriating in cushy accommodations is extremely disturbing. Some of these prison cells are literally nicer than college dorms. 

It makes me angry. Criminal justice reform is necessary, but what Scandinavia does is excessive. 

Giving the worst criminals and homicidal monsters a shoulder to cry on isn't ""humane"". It actually devalues human life in my opinion. If someone were to shoot ten people in the face, the authorities would give them a nice warm bear hug, a box of tissues and free TV instead of making them suffer in proportion to the severity of their crime. No matter how many lives you destroy, Scandinavia's prison system will ensure that you live like a king. This isn't ""humane"". It's psychotic. 

Prisoners get luxurious conditions and lots of free shit at the monetary expense of honest, hardworking, decent taxpaying citizens. While good people are out there earning their keep and paying taxes, the worst of humanity is being fattened by relative opulence. Instead of spending money pampering and coddling murderers, why not spend that money on healthcare, education, and public infrastructure? Instead of giving homicidal monsters free TVs, why not upgrade the computer facilities in schools? Instead of giving rapists nice big cushy accommodations like they're tourists, why not send foreign aid to Africa where good people are starving?

"Does an increase in capital productivity account for the productivity-pay gap? Hi,

I was recently having an argument with my right libertarian father and brought up the productivity-pay gap as something that helps keep poor people trapped even though they are working hard.

He brought an angle I was skeptical off but hadn't fully examined:

He argued that basically capital is now more productive than before, and this accounted for the gap because it means capital is more productive than labor.

My gut reaction is to say: well generally speaking, the more productive capital is, the more productive labor is, so those two should relatively correlate. Why? Well, more productive capital means less actual labor is needed for to produce the same number of goods, and since output increases, labor contribution must as well, otherwise output would remain constant. However, I am not aware of any economist or study that has examined whether increased capital productivity accounts for the productivity-pay gap.

"In Defense Of Geopolitical Realpolitik / Campism Historically, it is a multipolar world, not a unipolar world, that has given class movements in multiple countries political momentum.  You don't have to read fascist trash from Dugin to appreciate this.

Well before the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union, the ""lesser evil"" imperial power to provide critical support was Imperial Germany, trying to stick it to the Entente and their colonial shit.  [Friedrich Engels himself suggested conditional support for Imperial Germany if it were attacked.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1891/letters/91_09_29.htm)

The crucial timing that needs to be emphasized is whether there's a revolutionary period for the working class or not.  If it's *not* a revolutionary period, it's OK to support ""lesser evil"" geopolitical realpolitik / campism.  If it is a revolutionary period, do *not* support ""lesser evil"" geopolitical realpolitik / campism.

Karl ""John Kerry"" Marx got it wrong.  He supported German unification under Bismarck in 1870-1871, then flipped-flopped.  It was *not* a revolutionary period for the working class.  Moreover, German victory was a key catalyst to none other than the Paris Commune.

Both August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht got it wrong.  They should have been ""social patriots"" in German unification at France's expense.  Instead, they voted against war.  It was their anti-unification antics that brought about the Anti-Socialist Laws!

On the other hand, Alexander Parvus got it woefully wrong.  He supported a German victory in WWI.  However, it *was* a revolutionary period for the working class.

"'Class Struggle Unionism' hosted by The Virginia Worker Join The Virginia Worker for our second event of the year, featuring union organizer and author Joe Burns as he presents on his latest book 'Class Struggle Unionism'

Class struggle unionism is the belief that our union struggle exists within a larger struggle between an exploiting billionaire class and the working class which actually produces the goods and services in society. Class struggle unionism looks at the employment transaction as inherently exploitative. While workers create all wealth in society, the outcome of the wage employment transaction is to separate workers from that wealth and create the billionaire class.

From that simple proposition flows a powerful and radical form of unionism. Historically, class struggle unionists placed their workplace fights squarely within this larger fight between workers and the owning class. Viewing unionism in this way produces a particular type of unionism which both fights for broader class issues but is also rooted in workplace-based militancy.

"Boric and the Rising Tide: Social Democracy for the 21st Century It’s been a good year for the center-left. The conservatives have been kicked out in the US, the German SPD has reversed its decline and once again returned to power, as has the Norwegian Labour Party. The Portuguese Socialist Party is well on its way to winning a landslide re-election victory (against the confusingly named Social Democratic Party), and in the UK and Australia, the Labor Parties are shaping up to deliver defeats to the conservatives. 

But that’s not what I want to talk about. What I want to talk about is how social democrats can not only win power but keep winning it. To do this, I believe that we must look to Gabriel Boric’s campaign in Chile and what it can tell us about the future of social democracy, the youth movement and the ways we will need to change - and remain the same.

First and foremost, Boric calls himself a socialist. I believe that to modernize and move forward, social democrats must recognize that those to our left are, for the most part, not our enemies. For much of its history, this movement has been predicated on presenting itself as a third way between the excesses of capitalist oligarchy and the sham socialism of Marxism-Leninism. To put it simply, this is an absurd framing for the modern era. The triumph of neoliberal capitalism in the late 20th century has been so total as to eliminate Marxism-Leninism from the face of the earth, with the possible exception of Cuba. Whatever can be said about the ills of the left-wing populists, they are far closer to our own values than most anyone else. As such, I believe that to overcome the decline of the traditional centre-left, we must return to the big-tent coalition between progressive liberals, social democrats and democratic socialists that delivered the Nordic welfare state and the postwar economic miracle of Germany, brought democracy to Spain and Portugal and delivered the greatest sustained period of prosperity in American history under the New Deal. To put it simply, we need to stop fighting the last war and unapologetically embrace the democratic socialist heritage of Bernstein, Liebknecht and Crosland from which our movement emerged, and accept the diversity of opinion in what must ultimately be a broad front of democratic progressive movements (though we must be careful not to allow anti-democratic “leftists” such as Marxist-Leninists and especially Maoists into our ranks)  to restore the promise of the postwar consensus. While Germany and Norway provide evidence for this theory, nothing shows it better than Chile, where though the traditional center-left’s vote collapsed, their endorsement of Boric proved crucial in his victory over Kast in the second round. Though we are centre-left, left we remain, and we would be fools not to recognize that.

Furthermore, I believe that to have a real chance at moving past the failed neoliberal experiment and back towards a more human-centered, solidaristic economy, we must make every effort to engage with young people the world over, and accordingly adapt our ways of thinking. Social democracy has long been focused on traditional forms of worker organization through the trade unions. While undoubtedly, unions remain a critical part of the progressive movement, we must recognize that in the modern post-industrial West, the economy is now so diverse and so decentralized that it is effectively impossible to mobilize for economic and social progress through traditional labor groups alone. Thus, I believe that the future of social democracy lies with the youth and student movement. We can see this once again in Chile. The wave of protests that broke out in 2019 and ultimately led to the movement that brought Boric to power were led by youth and student groups, and Boric himself is a former student leader. The importance of this can hardly be overstated - the fact that a man just 35 years old has been elected the leader of a country with such an established political leadership group on the back of a student uprising shows how critical reversing the decline of youth engagement in politics will be in reinvigorating the social democratic movement. While Boric’s campaign was obviously focused on issues specific to Chile, I think that the general themes of his campaign - real action to address the economic insecurity that young people fear in today’s gig-focused economy and enforce a real living wage for all - are the most important aspects of the traditional social democratic programme to focus on in our campaigns. That is to say, we need not modify the programme of our movement itself, simply reframe and reinforce it to focus on the real issues facing young people today. Only then will we see real youth engagement return to politics. We can see this in action in Chile, and I believe that we can see the dangers of failing to address these issues in the decline of the traditional center-left and the rise of the Green parties and the populists. 

Overall, I think that moving forward, social democracy needs to focus on the real needs and desires of young people and the electorate of the future by implementing what could reasonably be called the “Boric playbook” - focusing on the ways in which a return to the post-war corporatist model represents the radical break from neoliberalism that so many people express a yearning for, and proudly embracing our heritage within the socialist tradition as part of a project to unite the democratic left and achieve lasting victory for social democracy.",Liberal

"Virginia election is turning me into a doomer Seriously, I understand the dem candidate wasn't the best, but I highly doubt the issues were virgina specific. It's a reflection on Biden's disapproval rating, which itself is based on events he can't even control (how is biden suppsied to fix global supply chain issues causing inflation). Even the NJ governorship was won with razor thin margins. 

The point is that in order to win , dems need a perfect economy, perfect gas prices, etc. Republicans can literally make up fake culture war drivel (CRT) that stokes the irrational fears of the electorate and win no sweat. 

Dems trying to counteract these idiotic republican narratives never seems to work. We always let Republicans control the narrative and have to base the conversation on whatever dumbass shit they say. 

I see a lot of progressives on reddit and twitter saying that we would win if dems were more left, but the problem runs deeper than that. A lot of them seem to think that Americans are much more leftist than they actually are, and can't accept the fact that many of them just have shitty views. Some suggest Dems should focus less on social issues and more on economic ones in hopes of getting those working class votes. I am highly skeptical of how effective that would be given the last few elections I saw (Bernie, NYC mayoral primaries, etc.). This country just seems too hyper capitalistic for that to work, we're at stage 0 of class consciousness.


My greatest fear of Trumpism assimialting into a thriving republican party without Trump has been realized. Many Americans that voted against Trump actually love Trumpism, they just didn't like the guy representing it.

Campaigning by US ambassador and three US Republican members of congress, including Thomas Tancredo of California, threatening cessations of aid and work permits for the countries’ people to work in America, in order to prevent election of FMLN candidate [Schafik Handal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafik_H%C3%A1ndal) and win victory of [Tony Saca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Saca) of the Arena party. FMLN former guerilla  group. Handal stated he would withdraw Salvadorean troops from Iraq,  re-examination privatisations and renew diplomatic contacts with Cuba. Arena extreme rightwing party, pro-US, free market, responsible for death squads and the murder of Archbishop [Oscar Romero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%93scar_Romero).

**Afghanistan 2004**

Pressure placed by US ambassador, [Zalmay Khalilzad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmay_Khalilzad), on political candidates to withdraw in favour of Washington’s preferred candidate, [Hamid Karzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai).

**Palestine 2005-6**

Massive pressure by the Americans to prevent the election of [Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas), including funding of the Palestinian Authority by the National Endowment for Democracy.

This last country is my own suggestion, not Blum’s.

**Great Britain?**

Go and read various articles in *Lobster*, which describe the way the US and its various front organisations collaborated with the right-wing of the Labour party to stop possible Communist influence. In the 1980s Reagan also created the [British-American Project for the Successor Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British-American_Project), alias BAP, to cultivate rising politicians of both the left and the right, and make them more favourable towards America and the Atlantic alliance. These included Tony Blair and Ed Balls, but you won’t read about it in the *Times*, because it’s editor was also a BAP alumnus.

"Recent Research on the economic impacts of Co-Determination **Study 1 (2020), from the Quarterly Journal of Economics:**
https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/2/669/5944124

_Conclusion of the study:_

_""We find no effects of board-level codetermination on wages and the wage structure, even in firms with particularly flexible wages. The degree of rent sharing and the labor share are also unaffected. We reject that disinvestment could have offset wage effects through the canonical hold-up channel, as shared governance, if anything, increases capital formation.""_


**Study 2 (2021) by the Bureau of Economic Research:**
http://economics.mit.edu/files/21562

Conclusions:

""The available evidence paints a picture of codetermination as an institution that grants workers some limited control, mostly over their immediate working conditions—providing a natural explanation of the institution’s limited empirical effects on major economic outcomes like wages or investment. This ""limited power"" explanation also accommodates the possibility that stronger codetermination arrangements, such as the more powerful works councils in Germany, possibly have larger impacts, as discussed in Sections 2 and 3.""

_""The limited impacts of European codetermination may reflect an inherent lack of power conveyed by existing arrangements, or the presence of institutional surrogates; future research could shed light on which of these potential explanations is most important in practice. Below, we discuss what these explanations might imply for the prospects of recent codetermination proposals in the United States.""

_Summary Conclusion:_

_""The evidence indicates that the European model of codetermination is neither a panacea for all the problems faced by 21st-century workers, nor a destructive institution that appears obviously inferior to shareholder control. Rather, it is a moderate institution with nonexistent or small positive net effects. Board-level and shop-floor worker representation cause at most small increases in wages, possibly lead to slight increases in job security and satisfaction, and have largely zero or small positive effects on firm performance. These limited effects may reflect limited power conveyed by existing codetermination arrangements, cultures of informal worker-management cooperation, or the influence of other pro-worker institutions""_",Liberal
"Is Absolute Poverty really higher than relative poverty in developed countries? Is relative poverty a better measure than absolute poverty for developed countries?

I often here conflicted things about absolute poverty in developed countries. On the one hand, the Brookings Institute, for example, says that almost no one is so poor in developed countries that they cannot afford food, shelter etc (the absolute poverty line according to the UN). Sure enough official statistics are that only around 1% of the population lives in such utter destitution.

But on the other hand think tanks say this or that about how even families well above the relative poverty line (ie 50% of the *national* median) cannot afford food or shelter or childcare. For example, one Canadian think tank says that a working family needs well over 37K a year to afford basic needs in my city, which is well above the Canadian federal poverty line of 28K a year.

So which is it?

Is absolute poverty really higher or lower than relative poverty line?",Liberal

"My response to ""Socialism has failed every time its been tried"".  I am pretty sure we have all experienced a conversation at some point in time where someone says, ""Socialism has failed every time it has been tried!' I am also sure that many of you are more educated than myself about socialism and history and have good responses to this kind of objection but I've given it some thought myself and would like to share what I would say. Please feel free to correct me or add your own thoughts so that I may learn!

Firstly, it is not socialism that has failed in places like the USSR, China, North Korea, or Venezuela. Socialism is worker ownership of the means of production. Thats it. You can have socialism without a planned economy or even just government regulation. That would market socialism, where every enterprise is owned and controlled by the workers. Businesses could still turn a profit and they could still fail if they do business badly. This could happen in a democratic country or a dictatorship. Governance isn't the defining factor.

Secondly, what failed in the aforementioned countries was the leaders' ability to create stable, democratic governments following a violent revolution. Here are two examples to illustrate this point: the American Revolution and the French Revolution. The American Revolution was successful in gaining independence for the country and creating a stable government because the colonies were democratic to start. There were democratic institutions before, throughout, and following the revolution. And the citizens were familiar with the democratic process.

As for the French Revolution, well... it was much more revolutionary. Several factors played a part in driving society to the brink. In just a few years, they went from undoing feudalism to overthrowing the king. The years that followed included the reign of terror, in which 16,600 counter-revolutionaries were killed (according to Wikipedia). The Republic lasted only 7 or 8 years before Napoleon entered the scene and things went back to authoritarianism. The revolution was a mess.

The difference here is that all of the countries that have had socialist revolutions tried to do what France tried to do back then. They were oppressed and wanted more for themselves. But they were going from zero to sixty in no time flat and they didn't have democratic institutions to stabilize the process. Things wound up being oppressive again because things were a mess and corrupt leaders took advantage of that. Socialism isn't the problem, governance is.

Again, please let me know if I've made mistakes here or if there is something you would add. I want to learn!",Liberal

"Heterosexual radical feminists, how do you deal with the need for intimacy? Hi! I'm 24 and I've been a radical feminist for a few years now. I want to ask my fellow heterosexual radical feminists (if there's any of us here), how do you reconcile your feminist convictions with you needs for intimacy and a relationship? As I'm getting older I see my friends entering relationships, getting engaged and so on, while I remain single as a pingle. I have a very good life I built around my relationships with women but not gonna lie, I increasingly find myself longing for intimacy and closeness that comes with having a partner. Morning kisses, sitting on someone's laps, cuddles... 

I tried dating but I'm heterosexual and the men out there... Subpar, exploitative, and boring individuals. It's almost palpable when they get uncomfortable when I assert myself. I respect myself, my experience, my knowledge and I won't cater for anyone's insecurities and make myself small. The men I have so far met are either not interested in dating someone like me, or straight up feel threatened by me. 
I tried hooking up, so at least my sexual needs are met, but it left me feeling even more desperate for the real intimate bond with someone.
I have close male friends but not partner material either. 

What should I do now? Should I keep on looking for a rare gem among men? Are there any decent men out there at all? Is there hope for me?

"Thoughts on labor market monopsony? Introductory paragraph for those that aren't already aware, monopsony is the flipside of monopoly. A monopoly is a single seller while a monopsony is a single buyer. In the labor market, firms are the buyers of the labor that workers sell. Aside from restricted cases, there are no literal monopsonies. What we're really interested in is if there is concentrated power on one side in the form of some price setting power as opposed to price taking predicted by perfect competitive market conditions. We could call the ability to price set wages on the part of firms ""monopsony power.""

If you believe in monopsony power, you can justify a range of labor policies as being economically efficient, such that minimum wage laws and collective bargaining wouldn't lead to unemployment. So whether or not it exists feels very important to establish. Failing to establish labor market monopsony means conceding that strong labor policy sacrifices employment for some people (though it's a bullet you could perhaps make a case for biting.)

A counter I've heard is that low skilled laborers actually have a lot of firms available to them to work for. Going from a low skilled job to a completely different low skilled job, let's say from being a construction worker to being a retail worker, doesn't have high transition costs compared to say switching from being a chemical engineer to being a computer programer. Therefore low wage, low skilled workers ought to be experiencing less monopsony power than high skilled workers.

The good counter counter I've heard is job search frictions are what really causes monopsony power for most low skilled workers. Perfectly competitive labor economic theory predicts that any firm that attempts to set wages would lose all of its workers immediately. I'm sure there would be an increase in turnover, but a firm probably wouldn't lose literally all its potential workers. Partially because people don't perfectly monitor their other options, partially because of a prospect theory type thing where people are more likely to act to avoid loses than to gain, and partially because changing jobs is stressful, involves considerable cognitive effort and possibly even moving to really maximize income. That might give employers some leeway in being able to price set.

What are your thoughts though? Does it exist? Why does it exist? Can we point to good empirical evidence that it exists?",Liberal

"Did Churchill do more to save Europe from Nazism than Stalin?  

Ok so what do you think? I despise Winston Churchill for being a disgusting imperialist but I think he did more to save Europe from Nazism than Stalin.

I understand that Stalin wanted to join West in an anti-Nazi pact[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/Stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-Hitler-if-Britain-and-France-agreed-pact.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/Stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-Hitler-if-Britain-and-France-agreed-pact.html) but Stalin also wanted to join Axis[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet\_Axis\_talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet_Axis_talks).

It looks like Stalin was playing both sides.

Honestly no one can ignore the amount of oil and other aid given by Soviet Union to Nazi Germany. They essentially created the Nazi war machine.

"Could randomly choosing people to serve in government be the best way to select our politicians? I'm a huge advocate of something known as **[sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)**, where people are randomly selected to serve in a legislature. Unfortunately the typical gut reaction against sortition is bewilderment and skepticism. How could we possibly trust ignorant, stupid, normal people to become our leaders? 


# Democracy by Lottery

**Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life.**

In the most commonly discussed implementation of sortition, lottery would be used to construct a legislature. Random sampling would be used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form a house of Congress. Service would be voluntary, for a fixed term, and be well paid. From there, the selected people would have the responsibilities and powers of any elected legislature. These sorts of legislatures would have substantial advantages against elected ones:

* Because of [random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\)), a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system, including race, class, sex, religion, ideology, cognitive ability, profession, and anything else you can think of. Sortition is therefore the ultimate method of creating a [proportionally representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Congress. 
* Without the threat of elections demanding ideological purity, a sortition assembly is better able to compromise with their fellow citizens and reach consensus. 
* Without the need for elections, legislators no longer need to waste time campaigning but can rather focus their time on their actual job.
* Legal bribery in the form of campaign donations is eliminated. 
* The nature of lottery creates a more egalitarian Congress ruled by regular people rather than the elites of society. 
* The nature of lottery possibly crushes the formation of political parties - parties that often form due to strategic campaigning needs to win elections. 



# Real World Evidence

Sortition is not a shower-thought. Sortition is thousands of years old and is the topic of active investigation by political scientists. Hundreds of sortition-based [Citizens' Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) across the world have already been conducted. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality in my opinion. For example:

 * The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a [Single-Transferable-Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. 
 * In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)), Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. These assemblies were used to resolve politically volatile subjects so that fearful politicians would not have to. 
 * Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize ""ecocide"", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals.
 * [America in One Room](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/america-one-room-experiment.html) deliberative polling experiments have demonstrated the ability of regular Americans to deliberate amongst one another and come to compromises. 

The usage of sortition has also been documented in many societies:

* The greatest known example of sortition is its use in ancient Athens, where lottery was used to select magistrates, legislative councils, and the People's Court. 
* Sortition was also used in combination with elections for the selection of leadership in Renaissance-era Italian City States such as a Venice and Florence. 
* Examples of sortition have also been documented to be used in [Indian tribes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12651). In these tribes, sortition results in an egalitarian government where power is shared. When elections were introduced into these societies however, the author observed the rise in power hierarchies and even ""toxic masculinity"". 


In these societies, you will find echoes of the claims I made above. Political parties in these societies are weak. Concentrations of power are reduced. 

# Comparing to Elections

All electoral methods are a system of choosing a ""natural aristocracy"" of societal elites. This has been claimed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. Elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. 

Moreover all voters, including you and me, are [rationally ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance). We don't have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our politicians. On average we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation, or the name or gender of the candidate, rather than actual qualification. We assume *somebody else* is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And yes, it is somebody else. Marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and specialists pay huge sums of money to influence your opinion and construct your news reality. Every elections is a hope that we can refine our ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in sortition, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed using the process of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy). Normal citizens are given the opportunity to deliberate with one another and come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude. 


# Implementations

There are many forms which sortition could take. I list some from least to most extreme:

* The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies or Deliberative Polling in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums. Examples of these have been implemented in Ireland, the UK, France. They have also been implemented in Oregon in the form of ""Citizens Initiative Review"" (CIR). Here, a random body of Oregonians are tasked with reviewing ballot propositions and giving referendum voters information about the propositions. 
* A hybrid, two-house Congress has been proposed where one house is chosen by lottery while the other remains elected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and con's of both sortition and election, and use both as checks and balances against each other.
* Random sortition legislators can also be added to existing parliamentary bodies to complement, rather than veto, the decision making capabilities of elected officials. 
* Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens are given the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring & managing procedure to make political appointments. This system removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws.
* Most radically, [multi-body sortition](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/428/) constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. 



# The History of Sortition
Democratic lotteries are an ancient idea whose usage is first recorded in ancient Athens in 6th century BC. Athens was most famous for its People's Assembly, in which any citizen could participate (and was paid to participate) in direct democracy. However, the Athenians also invented several additional institutions as checks and balances on the passions of the People's Assembly.

* First, the Council of 500, or the Boule, were 500 citizens chosen by lottery. This group developed legislative proposals and organized the People’s Assemblies.
* In addition, lottery was used to choose the composition of the People’s Court, which would check the legality of decisions made by the People’s Assembly. 
* Most government officials were chosen by lottery from a preselected group to make up the Magistracies of Athens. 
Athens used a mixture of both election and lottery to compose their government. Positions of strategic importance, such as Generals, were elected. 

## Historical Beliefs about Democracy 

Athenian democracy was regarded by Aristotle as a “radical democracy”, a state which practiced the maxim “To be ruled and rule by turns” [2 pp. 71]. For Aristotle, “It is accepted as democratic when public offices are allocated by lot; and as oligarchic when they are filled by election.” 

Renaissance writers thought so too. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu states, “Voting by lot is the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.”

How is it that ancient and Renaissance philosophers understood democracy to be selection by lottery, while modern people understand democracy to be a system of elections? Democracy was redefined by Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville while he travelled through the United States in the early 1800’s. Tocqueville was impressed by the equality of the social and economic conditions of Americans in the early years of the republic. Importantly, Tocqueville believed that the institutions of American “township democracy”, law, and the practice of the tyranny of the majority made America a land of democracy. Therefore he wrote and titled a book, *Democracy in America*, that redefined America as a democracy rather than the aristocratic republic which its founding fathers had desired. Tocqueville’s book would become a best-seller around the world. 

With Tocqueville’s redefinition of democracy that excluded the practice of lot, the traditions of democracy were forgotten and replaced with the electoral fundamentalism of today. From historican & advocate David Reybrouck, 

> “Electoral fundamentalism is an unshakeable belief in the idea that democracy is inconceivable without elections and elections are a necessary and fundamental precondition when speaking of democracy. Electoral fundamentalists refuse to regard elections as a means of taking part in democracy, seeing them instead as an end in themselves, as a holy doctrine with an intrinsic, inalienable value.” [1 pp 39].



# Concluding Remarks

There are many legitimate arguments against sortition, and these philosophical arguments have been waged for thousands of years since democracy's invention. We might assume that yes, there are superior people, and that the superior ought to lead the inferior irrespective of the inferiors' wishes. If you believe in this kind of superiority, democracy is not for you, and elections aren't for you either (How ridiculous is it to ask the inferior to select the superior!). But if you do believe in democracy, if you believe that people ought to govern over themselves, then I think you need to take sortition seriously as a way to enhance democracy and finally take it to the 21st century.

"Social Democracy and Education - a historical analysis for the future Hello fellow friends, comrades and colleagues

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was a delegate to the state conference of the *Junge Generation* (""Young Generation"", the youth unit of the SPÖ). In the main speech, held by our federal JG leader Claudia O'Brien she mentioned that education is something very important. As a response to the speech I answered that it is a huge problem that we forget about education, not on the classic level of obligatory schools, but more outside of school in various ways, for instance in ""Arbeiterschulen"" (Workers schools) run by SocDem parties.

As I took the train home, I thought about the concepts that Social Democrats developed in the early years of the movement - and still continue in some way. Today, I'd like to talk about education in the context of Social Democracy and how it can be a helpful tool for the future.

&#x200B;

**It's the education, stupid!**

Early in the formation of Social Democracy and Socialism as a political force, intellectuals like Victor Adler and August Bebel realised the importance of education for the improvement of conditions worldwide. Victor Adler, a physician, saw first hand the poor conditions of the Viennese workers in the 1870s and 1880s, struck by an economic desaster in Austria-Hungary. In this time, he saw that education was a low priority for children as they had to help their parents in the field or work in factories. Therefore their prospects for the future were bad as well as their life expectancy. Early on, even in the times of the *Sozialistengesetze* (Socialists Laws) in Germany, some intellectuals and smart people founded the first Abendschulen (Evening Schools) or Arbeiterschulen (Workers Schools) to teach basic things and especially the ideas of Marx and socialism in general.

Although the German Social Democrats were under ruthless pressure from Bismarck and the police, they did their best to bring more education to the people as best they could. Schools were only one form of this.

&#x200B;

**Vienna ahead!**

Victor Adler was the founder of the Austrian Social Democratic Workers Party in 1889. Before that, smaller clubs of Social Democrats did the same thing as in Germany: teaching workers. This even went in some instances so far to teach skills that could be helpful for daily work life - everyone was able to learn more from others. In the time of Red Vienna (*Rotes Wien*), the party improved their ideas and for once put them into effect on a great scale. Public schools were reformed under the supervision of Otto Glöckel - one of the fathers of modern public education. Not only increasing the public school budget but too educating the teachers in a new way - no physical punishment and more interactive learning methods between teacher and pupils.

Alongside came an offensive in party education, but not only in terms of classes. One things was the Arbeiterorchester (""Workers Orchestra"") where workers and socially poor people could attend concerts and such for very cheap money or even free. Singing choirs and such were too part of this. But the crown of it all was the Arbeiterhochschule (""Workers college""). Although it only existed for five years in the 1920s, it was a role model for educating promising members for higher positions in the crafts of politics and other things like economics. Some of the teachers were famous Austrian Social Democrats like Karl Renner, Otto Bauer, Max Adler and Julius Deutsch.

Another very important factor was the establishing of workplace libraries or even those in the Gemeindebauten (City Buildings - cheap but dam effective living quarters)

&#x200B;

**Education in modern times**

After the war, classic workers schools didn't contine - but rahter were reformed into different organisations. In Germany, the most famous one is the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, close to the SPD and financed by the state as well as donations. Not only give they speeches and courses, but help students of lower classes with their studies at university with scholarships. Today, the FES provides a lot of courses on the history of Social Democracy and other interesting facts to politics, economics and life in general.

In Austria, two institues close to the SPÖ are important places for party and general education: the Dr. Karl-Renner-Institut and the Jahoda-Bauer-Institut. Both give regular courses as well as help with book writings etc. For instance, I asked the JBI for help with materials for my bachelors thesis - and they gladly helped me with that. Both institutes provide a broad range of courses and ideas that can be visited by everyone interested, even and especially non-party members. The unions either cooperate with the two institutes or themselves provide their own courses from a wide range of topics - often enough historical ones (which I like and were even invited to - as a possible guest speaker).

One successor in the german-speaking areas were the *Volkshochschulen* (Peoples Colleges), where people of all ranges can take courses on all kinds of things - from languages to skills like cooking you'll find a lot there. They are indepedent, but the idea stems from the *Arbeiterschulen* of the earlier years. And: they aren't too expensive, but it depends on the region in which you live.

In Sweden, the ABF still serves a similar purpose, but it is more connected to other leftist movements today.

In Switzerland, Movendo is the educational institute of the SP Schweiz as well as the unions and are similar in idea and structure as the sister institutions in Germany and Austria.

&#x200B;

**The future of an old idea**

With this short view into history, I'd like to argue that this founding idea is one that Social Democracy should keep for various reasons.

One is quite easy: providing free or cheap education on various topics for all that are interested as education today is more important than ever for reaching our goals.

Second to show what we as Social Democrats want to do to improve the lives of the people - to hear their needs and develop innovative and progressive ideas.

Third to meet new people/friends and connect with them - talking about what wsa learned and how it can be put to use.

Fourth: to provide culture in a cheap and effective format - to be independent of high concert prices for classic music concerts for instance.

Fifth: providing cheap libraries is a great addition for all age groups - as all can benefit from the books there.

Sixth (and for me the most important): to secure and save the history of the movement. The Jahoda-bauer-Institut for instance is very active in remembering the February Uprising of 1934 in Austria, a very important bot often enough forgotten moment of Austria. Same with the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in remembering the fight against National Socialism with the words of Otto Wels echoing into the future: ""*Freiheit und Leben kann man uns nehmen, die Ehre nicht!*"" (You can take our freedoms and lives, but not our honour!""). That we shall never forget, that education is something for every human on this planet, not for the wealthy elites.

To crack the chains of class thinking and more social mobility - and I am one of those that profits from this!

I even see a great benefit from this: it might help to bring back our old strength and mobilise more people to the cause of Social Democracy - possibly even resulting in better voting results for SocDem parties. As we show that we not only care, but provide help to those that want and need it, independently from being in government or not.

&#x200B;

Therefore I am in favor of not only continuing, but expanding the idea - so that more people can learn what Social Democracy is about and understand the ideas behind it - striving for a better future.

For Liberty, Justice, Solidarity - and these three arrows are surrounded by a circle, by our most important value we have - democracy!

"Looking for help for a young woman - I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm really struggling to try to find the right resources for a young woman I met online, who needs some help. I stumbled across her question on the Quora site where she asked a question that hinted at some trouble at home & when I saw the original question, I saw that she had added some frustration that people were rude to her & part of my life staying sober is trying to help people who seem to need help, mostly because no one helped me growing up. We have a saying, that you try to Do The Next Right Thing.

I commented on the post that I was going to send her a private message & I have a 26 year old daughter who is also sober & if I ever reach out to a young woman, I always offer to set them up with my daughter if they are uncomfortable talking to a man. I offered to answer the question & which started a steady exchange of emails with this young woman.

She's 20 years old, she lived in North Carolina, & her mother took her out of public school in the 7th grade & has not only sheltered her from a more social life, but she to this day, actively shadows her, if she goes to her college class, the mother will drive her there, & hang out to watch her. Her mother forced her to take classes that the mother felt were good, mostly in cyber security & IT stuff, but she wants to be a chef some day.

She's been assaulted by family members in the past & everything she has is monitored, she has no idea what her absent father pays in support, & she's never seen any evidence that she's getting a benefit in that way. Her mother signed up for social services & added other children that don't live there for extra cash & food stamps. She controls the daughter's bank account, & she's been getting new credit cards in the daughter's name.

I know that some may read this & wonder why I trust some kid I don't know & I don't really want to write about my past & how I was raised to defend myself, & I ask that you just work on the assumption that she's honest & very believable. She has reported her mother several times, to police, to her grandmother's health aids, to the therapists & psychiatrists her mother sent her too, & its pretty clear that people don't want to get too involved & her mother is talented at talking it away.

She's really very intelligent, & I would say brave as well, but she's very naive, admittedly, she knows that she doesn't know what a lot of 20 year olds should know & she's pretty desperate to escape at this point. The only advice she's gotten from the few adults that have seen the abuse, has been, she should steal the car & run away, join the military or find a man to date or marry & hope he's nice. I'm sure that most of us can see the futility & real danger that could result in.

I've been trying to search online for organizations that help young women, to find her some resources. I'm very hesitant to just report it to her local child services & such because so far they haven't done much good & I worry that if we take action that doesn't work, things will get much worse for her. Really all I'm hoping for is that someone here can give me a name, an organization, something solid I can pursue & if not that, some direction on perhaps making a plea to the public or a reporter that likes to do personal stories of people in need - anything that could create the opportunity she needs to live her own life. I promise you, she's a remarkable young person & if given the chance, she will make the best of it.

"Thoughts about the whole Russia/Ukraine sitituation, and how it is being discussed right now One thing I've noticed about the current crisis is how everybody is presenting it like there're only 2 possible ""one side should win"" solutions: aither ""Ukraine is accepted into NATO"" or ""the West just agrees to Putin's demands"". The problem is that's not how the actual diplomacy should work.

Real diplomacy between countries (especially the Nuclear Powers) is done through **bilateral agreements.** If you actually want to preserve peace, you should call for something like ""The West agrees to not accept Ukraine into NATO, in exchange of Russia guaranteeing to never invade and legally limiting the allowed amount of Russian troops on Ukrainian border"" - both sides back down and sign to certain mutual obligations as a compromise.

However, instead the entire discourse presented as ""you should take a side"". And, I think, the reason is that **it was never about wanting peace.** Both sides clearly want to uphold their own imperialism, and so try to paint the situation as ""my imperialism winning is the only good solution"".

Particularly at the Western side, they want Ukraine in NATO, and so have crafted a narrative, in which the only alternative to this option is ""completely backing down to Putin, creating a precedent for further blackmails and making Ukraine even more vulnerable to future invasion"". Any compromise and any bilateral agreements are not considered as an option, and never talked about in the Western media, because the real goal is to get Ukraine into NATO, not to protect in from Russian invasion. Of, course, the same argument works for the Russian side as well.

As Socialists, who actually want peace, this is what we should call for - bilateral agreements between Russia and the West. Maybe, not exactely for the option that I've stated above (at the end, I am not a professional diplomat), but definitely for an agreement that will obligate both sides to certain concessions. Supporting the ""one side should win"" narrative ultimately means promoting imperialism, either Western or Russian.",Liberal

"Lenin (Day #1 of me Posting a Socialist Leader for every day in January) **LENIN (1870-1924)**

**Bio:**

Lenin was born in the town of Sibirsk (now Ulyanovsk) on April 22 1870, as Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov into a family of petty Bourgeosie minor nobles. Lenin was one of 8 siblings. In 1886 his father died suddenly of a brain Haemorrhage, an event that allegedlly caused Lenin to become an atheist. Just one year later Lenin's older brother (Alexander) was hung for being involved in Socialist politics and protests/a plot to assassanate the the Czar this even was a catalyst to Lenin's Radicalization and installed a deep hatred of the Czarist regime in him. In 1887 Lenin enterd the Kazan univercity, here he joined a student organisation (Zemlyachestvo) during this time he would lead protests over Czarist laws which had recently banned the student organisations, for this action he was arrested, expelled from the univercity and temporaraly confined to his family's estate. After a few months he was allowed to return to Kazan, however not to the Univercity during this time Lenin became aware of thr writings of Karl Marx and read *Das Capital*.

In 1889 Lenin relocated with his family to Samara, here he increasingly go involved in underground Socialist political groups, and became fully devoted to Marxism, this was in contrast to most Russian Socialists at the time, who wer agrarian Socialist of the Narodnik movement, one which from this time onwards Lenin would frequently critisize. In 1893 Lenin moved to Saint Petersburg and became involved in undergound Marxist groups, he also first met his future wife - Nadezhda Krupskaya during his time in the city. During the 1890s Lenin Left Russia and traveled around Europe, meating Socialist party/group leaders and theorists as well as collecting liturature which he covertly smuggled back into Russia. Due to smuggling the Socialist theory into Russia, translating it and attemting to distribute it to the proletariate, the Police arrested Lenin and several other Socialists with connections to him. In 1897 he was sentenced to 3 years exile in Siberia for the crime of 'sedition'. Lenin was exiled to the remote Siberian town of Shushenskoye, during his time here he was joined by Nadezhda Krupskaya due to her having organised a workers strike. After having completed his stint in Siberia, Lenin went into exile in Western Europe (primarily Switzerland) where he continued to write socialist articles which were clandestinely spread in Russia, during his time in exile in Europe he also met with other Marxists exiles including Leon Trotsky. In 1903 the Second Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) conference was held in London, during the conference Lenin's ideas caused friction and a split within the Party, this lead to the creation of two factions within the RSDLP the Majority faction (the Bolsheviks) led by Lenin, and the Minority faction who were more reformist than revolutionary (the Mensheviks) the two factions were soon locked in a bitter feud.

During the 1905 Revolution Lenin wrote numous articles urging the Bolshevilks to take an active role in leading the revolution, and to use violent and extream tactics whenever nessassary, this was justified by Lenin as he saw that the revolution was at risk of being compromised by it's Liberal wing, which were happy with the Czarist consestions of setting up a Duma and adopting a constitution, rather than what the Socialist Wing of the revolution aimed to achieve - a Proletarian workers state. His views on the Revolution were, predictably, condemed by the Menshaviks. despite Lenin's predition about the revolution coming true, he felt that it was safe enough to return to Russia during this time. After returing, Lenin became an editor for the revolutionary newspaper *Novaya zhizn*, and arranged for various acts of theift and robbery, most notably the Tflis Bank robbery of  1907, which was overseen by Lenin's close associate  Joseph Jugashvili. These activities caught the attention of the Czarist Secret police ( the Okrana) an Lenin was forced to flee again int exile in Europe in 1907. during his second stint of exile Lenin Lenin kept in close contact with Bolsheviks who remained in Russia, giving them advise and his opinons via letters. In 1910 Lenin visited the eighth congress of the Second International. Lenin was visited by Joseph Stalin in 1913 while he was in exile and they discussed amoung other things, how the ethnic minorities would be treated in a post revolutionary Russia.

Lenin was in Austro-Hungarian Galicia when the First world War broke out, due to his Russian citizenship he was briefly detained before being release once it was clear that he was not a Romanov agent. After this Lenin returned to Switzerland. Lenin condemed the German Social Democratic party for supporting the German war effort, which ran in contrast to the Second International's resolution to oppose the conflict. In February 1917 the Feburuary Revolution dethroned Czar Nicholas II and replaced his autocratic rule with the Liberal-Democratic provisional government. The provisional Government was initially very popular but soon lost most of it's support due to it's insistence on continueing the war. Lenin was happy when he hear the news about the revolution and managed to convinced the German government to allow him and several other revolutionaries to board a train for Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) (the Germans beleive that the revolutionaries would hurt the Russian war effort so agreed to this proposal) once back in Russia Lenin was greeted by eager crowds of Bolsheviksa and their supporters at the train station, here Lenin gave a speach critisizing the provisional government, urging an end to the war and that all power be given to the Soviets (Workers Councils)

Between July  16-20th 1917 Bolshevik supporters clashed with troops loyal to the Provisional government during *The July Days.* Following this, the provisional government cracked down on the Bolsheviks and raided their offices and issued an arrest warrent for Lenin, accusing him of being a German agent. Lenin had to go into hiding in a series of safe houses. In august an attempted coup was lauched againt the provisional government by General Kornilov, to defeat this, the leader of the Provisional governement (Alexander Kerensky) allowed Leon Trotskey and other bolsheviks to rally their supporters into an armed force known as the Red Guard in order to defend Petrograd and conduct sabotage to slow down the coup forces. the reactionary coup was soon defeated by the workers and the bolsheviks had a huge boost in both their power and their popularity. Sensing that it was now safe to do so, Lenin came out of hiding and retured to Petrograd. Once back in Petrograd Lenin called a meeting of the Bolshevik leadership and after a vote, it was ageed that a revolution was needed to overthrow the Liberal-Bourgeous Provisional Government in onder to establish a proletarian state. The Bolsheviks rallied their loyal Red Guard millitia to overthrow the government, after a shot was fired from the pro-Bolshevik controlled Battleship *Aurora* Bolshevik milititias captured key areas, such as tellagraph stations, railways, and political offices in and around Petrograd, largely without meeting any resistence from the disorganised Provisional Government. During this time Lenin Rallied the people to support the Bolshevik cause under the slogan *'' Peace, Land and Bread!'' -* promising that the Bolsheviks would end the war (Peace) redistribute land to the peasants from the nobility, and provide food/work for the starving masses in the cities.

In 1918 an ellection for the Constitutional Assembly was held, the Bolsheviks did not win the election however Lenin rejected the results sighting the fact that the election had been rushed - the Bolsheviks had not had time to properly campaign, and the results did not take into account the fact that the winning party - the Social Revolutionaries had split into two factions, the popular Left Social Revolutionaries (who sometimes co-operated with the Bolsheviks) and the reactionary Right SRs. Lenin also critisied the Constitutional Assembly as taking power away from the Soviets. After giving the assembly a proposed motion that would limit it's power, which the assembly rejected, the Bolsheviks accused them of counter revolutionary activity and used this to shut down the assembly, while increasingly centralisng centralising power into the hands of the Bolshevik party. During this time Lenin refused to work with other Socialist party such as the SRs or the Menshaviks. In 1918 the political situation remained tense as the war continued and the Germans made large gains following the collapes of the Russian Army due to the Revolutions. in March 1918 the Capital was moved from Petrograd to Moscow as a precautionary measure, and Lenin took up residence in the Kremlin, also in March, the Bolsheviks start to negotiate an end to the war with Germany, in the end they were forced to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which while ending the war, seceded Large amounts of land to the Central Powers, mostly in the Baltics and Ukraine and was seen as a humiliating concession. 1918 also saw two assasination attempts on Lenin's life, most famously the one in August 1918 by SR dissident Fanny Kaplan, this even was used as a one of the  justifications by Lenin for the rolling out of *The Red Terror* a campaign of propaganda, arrests and executions that aimed to destroy counter-revolutionaries and help stabalise the political situation in a way that favored the Bolsheviks and Socialism.

Despite the War, assasinations and Red Terror, Lenin still implemented numourous reforms and polices in late 1917- through 1918, amoung these was the seizing of Aristocrat and church owned land and redistribution of it to the peasants, the switching of Russia from the Archaic Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, a mass literacy progam and free education were introduced, the seperation of church and state was declard and womens rights were promoted by the Socialist woman's organisation Zhenotdel, which was founded in 1919. Between 1918-22 Lenin was largely occupyed with matters to do with the Russian civil war as and had to implement a policy of 'War Communism' whcih saw the state grown in power and the apropriation of Grain from peasants for the war effort (essentially total war). Numous Reactionary factions attemted to topple his Socialist Government as well as invasions by the Polish and military intervention by the entente that saw American troops in Siberia and French and British in Ukrain fight the Red Army as well as peasant Uprising against the forced confiscation of grain and other goods for the war effort eg, the Tambov rebellion. The enormous pressure and stress of both the civil war and implementing Socialist policies and the woulds he receved from the assasination attempts cause Lenin's health to seriously decline during this period, and as the 1920s started Lenin's health only continued to decline and he suffured numourous strokes. Due to his declining health Lenin increasingly withdrew from political life and the day to day running fo the Party. In 1921 Lenin introduced the New Economic policy (NEP) this was essentially a form of state Capitalism, which was seen as a nessesary evil to help rebuild Russia after the ravages of not only the Civil war, but also the Famine of 1921-22 that it caused, and the devistation brought about by the Flu Pandemic. the early 1920s also saw projects to increas electrifoction of the country, something Lenin was vigerously in favor of. 1922 saw the fuit of all his work for Socialism as December of that year saw the official declaration of the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

In late 1923 Lenin wrote a testiment which gave critiques of several of the leading figures of the Bolshevik party, notably Trotsky and Stalin, the testiment recommended the removal of Stalin from the post of general Secritary, as Lenin remarked that he was ''too crude'' for the role, the document also critisized Trotsky fro being suceptable to being over buerocratic and idealistic. Crucially the document was vague about who should succeed Lenin and this was left unclear after his death and would lead to infighting inthe Bolshevik party following  Lenin's passing. Lenin died on the 21st of January 1924 at the age of 53. following his death he was given a State funeral with his body lying in state for mouners to few for several weeks, after which his body was eventually embalmed and placed in a temporary mausoleum in Red Square, this was latter replace by the perminent Mausoleum which stands to this very day with Lenins body still on display.

"All cultures of anti-intellectualism such as the Dixie South and Most Recently ISIS terrorists are all written up by Intellectuals (or at least people who received some education). So despite what leftists argue, education will not fix ignorance because the very same brainy freethinkers create them. One of the things that is so circlejerked on the internet that it makes me nauseous is how backwards cultures such as hardcore American Republicans and Arab Muslims and esp the various ideologies and doctrines that are often so full of racism and other hateful bigotry like the Lost Cause narrative, traditionalist Catholicism, radical Wahhabi Islam, and Brexit........... Were all drafted up by intellectuals or at least people who received varying degrees of education.

It was German scientists that created the Nazi racial science and in turn they took these bigoted beliefs from stuff that was being taught in universities across Britain and America. The Lost Cause revival was basically formulated by Southern historians and other scholars (who were often direct descendants of Confederate soldiers). The hate towards education by American rightwingers? Go see the sources that indoctrinate this propaganda....... Major journalists and various rich educated people often controlling various publishing companies. Hell Trump perfectly embodies this as he graduated from Ivy League and look at all the hateful ideologies he spreaded. For almost 1000 years it was priests of the Catholic Church who were the most revered people of Medieval Europe and coincidentally they were also the most educated strata of people during that era. Look how long Europe was backwards and how stupidly superstitious peasants and other commoners were.

But the best example in recent times? Go see ISIS. Practically everybody at the top of the organization were all people who had masters or PhDs (hell some even taught in universities not just in the Middle East bu even in the West years before). Below the top oligarchy, many folks who occupy the upper tiers and mid upper tiers were scientists, doctors, and other people who worked very complex white collar jobs requiring years of education.

Simply put it was college graduates who organized ISIS in the first place.

So its very naive of leftists esp SJWs and libertarians to believe education is the key to brush off anti-intellectualism because it was freethinkers who created stuff such as the Nazi Party and feudalism in the first place. American Exceptionalism didn't just pop out of thin air and neither did a bunch of illiterate blue collar morons workers in Germany suddenly just start hating Jews because they lack logic and had low IQs. Its often brainy people who start pioneering ideas such as ""white people are superior to all blacks and any white man who has a drop of POC blood is not white and thus should be hated"" or British Imperialism and Queen Victoria's right to rule all over the world.

If anything educated institutions are responsible for creating ideas such as women being forced in the kitchen because the Bible says so (which priests at universities were teaching in the Middle Ages under authority of the Vatican) and French nationalism schools in Paris were emphasizing how France was the most glorious country during the 19th century).

So if Americans suddenly became intellectual readers, it won't end stuff like racism nor will Brits be convinced that the UK should rejoin the EU if every person in the UK got educated enough for a B.S. degree despite how SJWs, libertarians, and other leftists love to shoutout in their echo chambers as they do anti-conservative circlejerking.",Liberal

""As Paul Hanebrink’s [bracing history](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Specter-Haunting-Europe-Myth-Judeo-Bolshevism/dp/0674047680) of the myth of “Judeo-Bolshevism” demonstrates, 20th-century anti-communism rarely engaged with the reality of communism. It was, instead, driven by racial and nationalist myths. The idea that there was something inherently “Jewish” about communism, that it was a threat to national existence, extended well beyond the fascist right. In 1917, the chief Russia correspondent of the Times blamed the Russian Revolution on the “seething mass of Jewish pauperdom”. Winston Churchill blamed communism on the “International Jew”, who had no loyalty to the nation.

In the US, race theorists such as Lothrop Stoddard regarded Bolshevism as a “traitor at the gate”, subverting racial hierarchies. Woodrow Wilson’s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, fancied that the Russian Revolution proved the veracity of the [Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/24/theprotocolsofzionarecomi). The [Lusk Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusk_Committee) argued that all traditions of socialism were of German-Jewish extraction. Such tropes were commonplace in the battle against civil rights led by White Citizens’ Councils, and the Ku Klux Klan.""

""Why should anti-communism be so amenable to such racist, conspiracist, and apocalyptic thinking? Perhaps because it works in a similar way. In “black-hole anti-communism”, as Joel Kovel dubbed it, everything that is perceived as threatening can be compressed into a single, treasonous, diabolical enemy: just different tentacles of the same communist kraken.""",Liberal

CCR EXPLAINS HLP v. HOLDER: NATIONAL CALL FOR SOLIDARITY ACTIVISTS AND AID WORKERS

 

Are you involved in international solidarity organizing, conflict resolution, or humanitarian aid work?

 

Are you worried that the recent Supreme Court decision about the “material support” statute in Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder (HLP) might criminalize your peace work?

 

Do you have questions about how recent FBI raids on solidarity activists might relate to you?

 

The Center for Constitutional Rights, the human rights organization that litigated HLP up to the Supreme Court, is holding a series of calls for activists and humanitarian aid workers who are concerned and have questions. CCR attorneys will give an overview of the decision and its implications and answer questions that are emailed in to them. Please join us for the first call:

 

Wednesday, December 8, 2010 at 5pm EST

Conference Dial-in Number: (712) 775-7100

Participant Access Code: 413502#

 

We request your RSVP and questions in advance. Send to: events@ccrjustice.org with “HLP RSVP” or “HLP question” in the subject line.  

 

**Please note that we will be accepting all questions during the call through the email address events@ccrjustice.org. In order to submit questions please plan to have access to your email.

 

Background on Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder

 

CCR challenged sections of the “material support” statute (18 U.S.C. § 2339B) on behalf of various groups and individuals who had provided and wanted to continue providing  nonviolent dispute resolution training, humanitarian aid, and other similar services to foreign organizations on the State Department’s designated terrorist list. CCR argued that these sections of the material support statute violated the First Amendment and criminalized lawful and non-violent activities that might actually promote solutions to conflicts.

 

While multiple lower courts had found language in the material support statute to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, last June the Supreme Court overturned these decisions, finding the law to be constitutional. The Court allowed the vague language to remain in the statute, raising concern that peaceful solidarity and humanitarian work could be criminalized.

 

Since this Supreme Court decision, various groups doing international solidarity work or providing humanitarian aid have sought to understand how it could impact them.  Concerns have only heightened since the September 2010 FBI raids on Palestine and Colombia solidarity activists and the recent reactivation of subpoenas investigating their activities.

"Delving into the ""uncool"" side of BDSM, and how to stop wanting it Hello everyone, I'm a psychologist and I have been studying since 2010 about psychopathology, and the relevance of childhood experiences in adulthood. But this post will be both a confession and a bit of a case study.   
I wasn't born in the US, I was born in South America, and there hate crimes against women are 10 fold worse than it is in southern US. Rapes and violence against women happen every minute. To add to this already not so nice social atmosphere, I can only describe my childhood as having lived and survived relentless torture, psychological, physical and for a brief period sexual torture. Systematic, daily and for no reason, except partially because I was born female.   
I grew up sorta uninterested in relationships this life had made me standoffish and aloof, also I'd wear modest clothes with no cleavage, and loose, the sexual assault made me disgusted of my own body and I didn't want anyone to look at my ""form"" the thought of someone wanting my body was terrifying to me. 
Fast forward to the time I was exploring online porn, after my 20s, I'd end up looking at quite kinky stuff, BDSM, degrading scenes, with punishment and such. Why was I attracted to this kind of thing? To be frank I rather had ignored it for a while, but guilt and the feeling I deserved to be treated like sh*t was the core reason for it. And the feeling women needed to be submissive to men. After watching it I felt disgusted and sad.  
It was just not a healthy thing, so in order to stop this ""preference"" my mind seem to have & my sense of justice disagreed with, I went on watch a couple of these things, this time, I placed myself in these women shoes, I thought of ""what if my partner actually did this to me?"", What if it was a stranger, what are these ""actresses"" really feeling. >>Were they abused too?? Do they just need the money desperately.   
I can promise you that will ruin basically any porn for almost anyone, because it did for me, also realizing I was just re-experiencing all the traumas from my awful childhood. I did not hate or blame myself for having liked it. In a way finding that I had an attraction to it made me understand myself better and getting rid of that attraction together with realizing what it represented was truly amazing. 

I'm no longer a kinky person, I no longer want h porn, not because I am denying myself a pleasure, rather than there's no pleasure to get from it. Today I enjoy my sessions of cuddly sex with my partner and it's more and better than any kinky act could ever give me. Sometimes we just cuddle and fall asleep in each other's arms. It is so sweet and nurturing & there's no moral hangover or guilt after, only joy.

TLDR REFLECTIONS: maybe BDSM is not as liberating for some as they try to paint it as, be watchful of what that makes you feel after you're no longer horny. Why does that position of helplessness and submission (or domination) attracts you so much & what can you learn about your own emotional and psychological universe through sexual preferences (or paraphilias). What does it tell you about how you see yourself and what position you put yourself in, in the dynamic of a sexual exchange?   
   
I hope this has sparkled a sense of curiosity in some of you and please know that you don't need to be ashamed. But every now and then ask yourself if what you are doing, is building you up or tearing you down. I wish I have shed some light into the non pretty side of why some people like BDSM, I cannot answer FOR anyone why they do, but I hope I have made the right questions so that they can find, if there's any of you here.

"Russia/Ukraine from a socialist perspective I'll admit my own ignorance on this subject, which is why I want some input.

&#x200B;

The situation currently in Europe is, without a doubt, being stoked by NATO/US to some extent. From a left-wing perspective especially, I know how much that NATO is a cheap extension of US interests, and pretty much every involved power is itching to sign defense contracts.

However, I also know how much Russia is actually causing problems for the Ukraine, outside of any western spin. It reeks of imperialist ambition, and should not be supported.

What should governments, from a left-wing perspective, try to diplomatically do here?

"Help me educate my friend about the patriarchy Hey everyone! This is my first post here,!

A good male friend of mine, who is ""woke"" about a lot of things, just surprised me by telling me he doesn't believe in the patriarchy and that it's just a victim mindset. We were texting and here's how the conversation went:

Him: ""I dont really believe too heavily in the patriarchy I feel like it's a victim mindset. Most people who get shot are men, most people in prison are men, most homeless people are men, most suicides are male."" 

Me: ""Woooow"" 

Him: ""It's true though"" 

Me: ""Okay I'm not going to get into this because it's sleep time for me but seriously please do actual research before making statements like that. And as for the suicide rate I'm really surprised you didn't learn in psych about the fact that the only reason male suicide is higher is because they use more lethal means because they don't care what they look like and the clean up after they die but women do because, patriarchy. Women attempt suicide significantly more than men do.

The patriarchy doesn't just negatively impact women, it impacts men as well. Just do the research because you're smart and if you actually look into it and it's roots and statistics and the reasons for statistics you will definitely change your mind.""

Him:""Oh I know that men typically use more lethal means while women don't that's well known. Why would less lethal suicide methods be due to a patriarchy?
I'm open minded so fill me in I'm eager to know
 Feminists are amazing but there's some who go too far and pretend like there's an issue when there's not
There's lots of things that are bad for men, such as the other examples to only name a few""

Me:  I can find information for you but it's not my job to educate you on it. The patriarchy made those things. Men aren't supposed to show emotions so they don't get help for their issues so they kill themselves =patriarchy. I'll send stuff tomorrow
Night night x""

Him: ""Awesome, night night  x"" 

He's obviously wrong and it hurt me he actually feels this way. I'm heading to bed for the night and quite frankly have no energy to help educate him. He's very open to learning more though, so I thought this would be a great sub for me to find and share resources with him. If this post gets any traction I'll definitely show it to him. 
So I'm asking for you lovely people to share any information and resources about the patriarchy and its effects on society (including men).

This seems like a really shallow literary basis for understanding socialist theory in general and Marx's work in specific. Also, the manifesto doesn't go into the main ideology within socialist theory (dialectical and historical materialism), so this is also problematic.

"Hear me out! Tuition fees are a good thing. Here in the UK, the Labour party put the abolishing of tuition fees in their manifesto, this pledge won the support of a great many young people. However, [this](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/9217) piece from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that these policies would increase the government deficit by around £12.7 billion, of which £11 billion is from scrapping fees. It concludes that Labour’s Higher Education proposals will cost £8bn per year, although increase the deficit by more. Graduates who earn most in the future would benefit most.

On a recent thread on this sub, a comment in response to mine showing support for tuition fees went like this:

[College is even free in ex yugolavia which is by no means social democratic lmoa. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qx6tnj/comment/hl91qzv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[ah I remember this c\*ntrist](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qx6tnj/comment/hl91qzv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Btw, that is not true, only one ex-Yugoslav republic has free college, unsurprisingly, it's Slovenia.

I think [this link](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1501.pdf), which talks in great detail about the situation before tuition fees in England, the issue which led to their establishment and their result, is a good source for this issue from one of the most prestigious economic institutes in the world. This report was co-written by its head, Stephen Machin.

It ultimately concludes

>we study the English higher education system which has, in just two decades, moved from a free college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world. Our findings suggest that England’s shift has resulted in increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. In contrast to other systems with high tuition fees, the English system is distinct in that its income-contingent loan system keeps university free at the point of entry, and provides students with comparatively generous assistance for living expenses. We conclude that tuition fees, at least in the English case supported their goals of increasing quality, quantity, and equity in higher education. 

We must also look at how people pay back this debt.

If I were to start paying off my debts tomorrow, here is how my repayment would work:

The thresholds are £524 a week or £2,274 a month (before tax and other deductions). 

I'm paid weekly and your income changes each week. This week my income was £600, which is over the Plan 2 weekly threshold of £524.

My income was £76 over the threshold (£600 minus £524). I will pay back £6 (9% of £76) this week.

I will pay back just 1% of my weekly earnings each week. 

It is not like I have to pay the 100,000 of debt I will be left with by the end of 30 years with interest because, after 30 years, all of my debt left unpaid will be written off.

[This is a cool tool](https://www.student-loan-calculator.co.uk/) you can use to figure out at what wage and how much you would pay back for your debts in the UK.

Fundamentally, there isn't much the UK does better than Europe at, but universities and upper education including tuition fees is one of the things we exceed at. We have a greater proportion of people from lower socio-economic backgrounds going to university and it has only grown since the measures of the coalition government.

I don't think we should be throwing billions of pounds at removing tuition fees so fewer poor people can go to university. 

If you read this far, thank you! You probably disagree with me but thanks for reading what I have to say.

Edit: I am only talking about the English tuition fee system, I don't know much about the American model.

"Fascism needs help from moderates. Fascism cannot survive without support from the center. I previously mentioned that I'd read a book about Willy Brandt and I'm posting 12 excerpts over 12 days. What strikes me, in this section, is how many ""moderate"" conservatives, in many countries, were willing to work with the Nazis. 

Fascism needs help from moderates. It is the attitude of those in the center who determine whether fascism can thrive. In some eras the moderates are unified against fascism, and in those eras fascism will remain asleep. But when the moderates favor cooperation with fascism, then fascism will tend to grow. During the 1930s, it was noteworthy how many moderate conservatives were willing to work with Nazi Germany. This was international – in Norway and Sweden and Belgium and the Netherlands there was a thick network of fascists helping the Nazis, and the moderate conservatives, where they were in power, were perfectly content to let this happen. Brandt’s story offers dozens of examples of how much the Nazis gained power because of help from right-of-center governments that were not nominally fascist.

"Day #8 of me posting a Socialist Leader for Every day in January - Ho Chi Minh **HO CHI MINH (1890-1969)**

Bio:

Little is definitivly known about Ho Chi Minh's early years, but he was born in modern Nghe An Province around the year 1890, in French Indo-China. He was the son of a local Magistrate. During the 1910-20s Ho traveld aroud Europe, to France Britain and various other countries, usually under various psydonyms and worked a varity of Jobs on Ships, in Hotels and eslwhere as a cleaner, cook etc. During this time Ho met various Socialists and may have read the Works of Marx and Engels. By the mid 1920s Ho was a Dedicated Communist and Member of the 3rd International, during this time he visited the Soviet Union and China (Hed had to leave China in 1927, following Anti-Communist Purges by Chiang Kai Shek) During the 1930s he retured to China to help advise the CPC. during 1940/41 Ho returned to Vietnam, deturmind to help the country frow off the shackles of Imperialism and expell the French colonialists. The French regime change to a Nazi-Puppet in 1941 (Vichy) and Indo-China was occupied by the Japanese who were just as, if not more Brutal than the Former French controlers of the region. Ho launched a guerrilla campaign against the Fascist Invaders and recieved information and Material support from the Allies (inc. ironically the Americans) this campaign was successful and by 1945 the Fascist Japanese had been driven out of Indo-China.Following this Ho declared the Independence of Vietnam As the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Hoever this declaration was not recognised by the Western Powers who soon supported the return of the French Imperialists. In respounce to this Ho, and the Vietnamese Communist Party called for A general strike. During this time the Communist under Ho also fought against Trotskyist rivals in the south. The French respounce to Vietnamese Resistance to Re-colonialisation was Brutal, Socialists Of All stripes (Marxists, Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists and Anarchists Were Arrested By the French as they tried to regain control) the French also Bombared the city of HaiPhong. these Events led to a Indo-Chinese war of Liberation from the French (the First Indo-China War) after commiting numerous Atrocites, the French were finally defeated by Ho Chi Minh and The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, notably at the Famous battle of Dein Bein Phu, and were Driven from the region, Following peace agrements that ended the war, Vietnam was Partitioned in the Democratic North, And the Pro-Western Capitalist Dictatorship in the South. Cambodia and Laos were also Given independence.

Following the partition, the south Supported by the CIA attempted to Boost it's popularity and discredit the North, but most of the Country still suported Ho Chi Minh and saw him as a Liberator who had led the country to Victory over both the Japanese and the French. During this time Ho's party began a land reform campaign and supported Communist Guerillas of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong) Ho Chi Minh would lead his country during the Vietnam war, But sadly Died before he could see a Communist Victory and the re-unification of the country. Ho Chi Minh died on September 2 1969 at the age of 79. Ho Chi Minh was given a state Funeral, and despite what he stated in his will (He wanted to be cremated) his body was embalmed and placed in a larged mausoleum in Hanoi, where it remains to this day.

Hi guys after reading some books on Marxist theory I’m still confused about this aspect.

1 did Marx believe that the material living standards of the working class will increase or decrease with the development of capitalism 

2 Why did workers living standards in reality in western countries inxrease during the 20th century 

3 With globalisation will we see a decrease of workers standard of living in the west.

"Nigeria is a case study in what has come to be called the “resource curse.” Valuable raw materials are discovered in a country lacking robust institutional safeguards, and corruption follows. From this book:

Thieves of State

Why Corruption Threatens Global Security

By Sarah Chayes, 2015

Page 122–123

Venality hardly stops at the police in Nigeria.

The first tipping point on the road to acute, systemic corruption, says former Global Fund for Peace president Pauline Baker, who lived there for decades, came in the 1980s. That was when the oil boom began. “There was military rule, meaning no accountability, and then free money from oil.”

Nigeria is a case study in what has come to be called the “resource curse.” Valuable raw materials are discovered in a country lacking robust institutional safeguards, and the “rents” these resources produce rupture any contract between rulers and ruled. Quality of life changes negligibly, or even negatively, for regular people, despite the bonanza. At roughly two and a half million barrels of crude per day, Nigeria is the world’s thirteenth–largest producer and the largest in Africa. (The United States imports some 40 percent of the country’s production.) But Nigerians’ life expectancy, educational achievement, and average income, taken together, is about the same as that of their resource–poor neighbors.

Official oil revenues are split between the federal government on the one hand, and the thirty–six state and more than seven hundred local government executives on the other. This downward distribution of national revenue contrasts with Afghanistan’s system, in which provincial governors receive almost no share of the national budget, but get carte balance to extract resources at their own level however they want.

Not all of Nigeria’s oil revenues make it into the official budget, though. On September 25, 2013, Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi wrote to President Goodluck Jonathan with “serious concerns” about the national oil company’s failure “to repatriate significant proportions of the proceeds of crude oil shipments.” In a carefully documented memo early the next year, Sanusi quantified that failure: over nineteen months, approximately $20 billion unaccounted for. “More than $5b. went for a kerosene subsidy, but there’s no allocation for that,” he charged to me later that year. “There are swaps of crude for refined product, but Nigeria is cheated in the swap.” On February 20, the wisely respected official was sacked.

This leakage of national wealth is typical, attests the MacArthur Foundation’s Kile Shettima. “There are always shortfalls in the federation accounts. It’s a permanent fight between the Finance Ministry and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation – where the real issue is. It’s a big cartel feeding off the backs of the people.”

In the view of a Western official in the capital, Abuja, Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan “has not been as clever as his predecessors. He and his circle have been taking too much oil money before it gets into the budget.” Another high–ranking Western diplomat remarks sardonically that the oil minister, Diezani Alison–Madueke, is “just doing her job – providing Jonathan with money.” An official at a different embassy, who monitors the oil producing south, dubs her “Jonathan’s ATM.”

––––––––

Page 124

Indeed, such majors as Shell and Italy’s ENI began temporarily shutting down pipelines in 2013, wherever significant siphoning was detected. “The scale of these activities has reached unprecedented levels,” wrote Shell Nigeria chairman Mutiu Sunmonu in a company report, calling the theft “a parallel industry.”

Nigeria does not convert its own crude into consumer products, moreover. The country’s four refineries languish in disrepair. The government imports fuel from abroad and sells it at a subsidized rate – another opportunity for corrupt scams.

Given the unique opening that oil, like other types of mineral wealth, provides for centralizing production and capturing the resulting wealth, it is perhaps unsurprising that other segments of the Nigerian economy have been allowed to wither.

In a country where rains lash much of the territory for half the year and seeds need merely to be scattered to grow – the envy of a parched place like Afghanistan – the diversity and productivity of Nigeria’s agriculture have plummeted since the 1960s. At that time, it was an agricultural exporter; now it imports basic foodstuffs, its overall productivity barely higher than what it was a half century ago. And according to the Nigerian government’s own figures, public investment has been “exceptionally low,” even by African standards. Underinvestment in transportation infrastructure and power generation has also damaged the food industry.

Innovators in a sector that still absorbs most of the country’s manpower crave the least sign of official encouragement. The eyes of a taxi driver are in the capital, Abuja, who had graduated college in agriculture, lit up as he described the business he dreamed of founding: a closed–system farm, where he would produce high–quality meat for Abuja’s upscale hotels and restaurants, by planting soy for oil and feeding the nourishing stalks to the cattle. He had a plan all mapped out but could not obtain a loan at less than a crippling 26 percent interest rate.

"Rant: General Strikes and the illusion of a short war Before I get into this post I want to affirm a few things. Workers rights and the exercising of those rights should always be supported, strikes are an effective tactic and this post is aimed at the folks who are always ""organizing"", proclaiming and making graphic posters for general strikes.  The inspiration for this post comes from [tweets](https://twitter.com/ryanhoulihan/status/1477895622028107781) like this and the previously ""planned"" October 15th general strike.

&#x200B;

The short war illusion comes about when the leaders of an army refuse to consider any possibilities other then a total, outright, decisive and immediate victory for there side.  This can happen for a number of reasons, nationalistic pride, a refusal to consider defeat, misunderstandings / ignorance of history and so on.  Now we can look back and see some great examples of this illusion at work, The big hits are the first world war with everyone being ""home for Christmas"",  The French, German and Japanese plans in world war two.  Even more recently the invasion's of Iraq and Afghanistan.  When we refuse to consider all possible outcomes, question are own plans, learn from history and let some form of ideological or nationalistic dogma run the show it tends to always turn into a muddy quagmire that ends up worse then we ever thought.  And right now I see the same mistakes being made when it comes to the supposed general strike that someone or other online is saying is always about to happen.

&#x200B;

So with that tweet its claimed that a 9 day general strike would result in ""we could demand anything we wanted"".  Lets go through a few facts of the matter.

&#x200B;

* Pretty much every successful general strike has taken months and months of direct action.
* I could only find one example of a general strike under 2 weeks being successful and that was the [1998 Spanish General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Spanish_general_strike) which should get an \* next to its name as it happened under a social democratic government who conceded to them
* There is a ton of short term and longer term general strikes that have failed and failed miserably to the point where in the [1926 UK General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike) they gave up after 9 days and the next year trade union rights were severely impacted.  Both the 1972 Quebec and [1976 Canadian General Strike](https://canadianlabour.ca/the-largest-labour-protest-in-canadian-history/) were unsuccessful at accomplishing there goals and those went on for months.

&#x200B;

Now where do general strikes and war tie in?  They are both struggles between two groups, where as war is traditionally nations and where strikes are about workers vs owners / rich vs poor.  A general strike is not just an action against a specific company but against the system as a whole and the government.  It can be an incredibly powerful tool when used right.  It can also lead to disaster, lose people there homes, create a regression in the rights of workers.  Since this type of strike wouldn't be legal and companies like Walmart can then just fire all there employees lets take a wild guess at whose bank accounts are ready for a war of attrition,  Is it the mega corporation whose gross profit is in the hundreds of billions and can borrow even more from big banks, or would it be the worker who is already behind on there rent, with maxed out credit cards?  So then when the 10th day of this poorly lead strike passes and the workers get none of there ambiguous demands met what happens?  Do they all go back to work with unemployment at record levels and everyone willing to work whatever job they can get for as little pay or do they stay out in the cold after there landlord evicts them?  It is this type of blind, deaf and dumb planning that has lead to such great failures.  These people have failed to consider any outcome other then a ~~short war~~ I mean short general strike and they have failed to do even the most basic research into the history of general strikes.  

&#x200B;

The working class and middle class is getting the shaft right now plain and simple and something has to be done.  But going to war being led by armchair generals who can live off of daddies money regardless of how the strike goes is going to go about as well for the working class as everyone calmly walking towards machine guns across an open field did in 1914.  So if we are going to escalate the ongoing class war, lets put the reckless and idiotic ideologs in there place and look at every possibility, and make the best decisions we can.

I know this sounds like a very simple premise, but it goes back to a post I remember seeing years ago from someone saying they wished more leftist works were available as audiobooks because they often feel too burnt out to read after work. While I couldn't read more modern works because of copyright many great leftist writers (i.e. Marx, Trotsky, Goldman, Kropotkin, etc.) are in the public domain. So by using a free hosting platform like Anchor I could essentially make free leftist audiobooks.

"Postal Labor Union, Activists push for the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking Until the late 1960s, you could walk into a post office and deposit money in a savings account at the same time that you bought stamps or mailed packages.

An outgrowth of the financial panic of 1907, the no-frills postal bank surged in popularity during the Great Depression. But as commercial banks expanded and offered higher interest rates, the United States Postal Savings System became as outdated as a black-and-white movie.

Now, in the wake of another financial crisis, there's a new push for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver basic banking services again.

The effort is led by consumer advocates, financial reform groups, postal labor unions and some leading liberals, such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). They say that offering services such as paycheck cashing, bill payment and free ATMs would provide cash-strapped consumers with an affordable alternative to payday, auto-title and other short-term loans that have been criticized for high fees.

""We have millions and millions of low-income people who have to go to these payday lenders and pay outrageous interest rates. They're getting ripped off right and left,"" Sanders said on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" in October.

""We can have our Postal Service provide modest banking to low-income people where they can cash their checks and they can do banking,"" Sanders said. ""I think it will help the post office and it will help millions of low-income people.""

The Postal Service's inspector general's office agrees. It estimates that expanding financial services beyond the current limited offerings, which include money orders and international funds transfers, could pump $8.9 billion a year into the financially struggling agency.

""The Postal Service has a public mission to serve citizens and support the growth of commerce,"" the inspector general's office said in a report last spring that presented five potential approaches for expanded banking services. ""And while it is required to cover its costs, profit is not its key motive.""

The American Postal Workers Union has formed a coalition, the Campaign for Postal Banking, that in December delivered a petition with more than 150,000 signatures to Deputy Postmaster General Ronald A. Stroman urging the agency to expand its financial offerings.

""Big banks are turning their backs on families,"" union President Mark Dimondstein said. ""Without bank accounts, they fall prey to predatory lenders.""

Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan hasn't ruled out the idea of expanded banking services after her predecessor dismissed the suggestion in January as he headed into retirement. But she has some reservations.

""While we currently provide our customers with certain financial services, including money orders, electronic funds transfers and cashing of U.S. Treasury checks, our core function is not banking,"" the agency said in a written statement. Get our weekly business news briefing >>

The service said it has an ""infrastructure that is not ideal as a banking platform,"" and cited a decline in visits to post offices. Plus, any investments outside of its core function of mail delivery ""will likely be scrutinized from both public policy and regulatory perspectives,"" the agency added.

The Postal Service is an independent agency that since 1971 has been required to rely on sales of stamps and other services to pay for its operations. But the growth of the Internet and competition from private shippers, such as FedEx Corp. and UPS, have taken a major toll on the agency's finances.

After peaking in 2006, total mail handled by the Postal Service has declined 27%. That has led to budget deficits, exacerbated by a congressional requirement to pre-fund retirement benefits for its workers, that have forced the agency to borrow up to its allowable limit of $15 billion from the U.S. Treasury.

Expanded financial services offer ""the single best opportunity for new revenue,"" according to the inspector general's office.

It's not a far-fetched idea. Post offices in many other nations, including Britain, France, China and Japan, also serve as banks. And from 1911 to 1967, the United States Postal Savings System offered accounts with annual interest capped at 2%, to reduce competition with commercial banks.

Deposits at U.S. postal banks surged during the Great Depression and World War II, when many consumers viewed the accounts as more secure than those in commercial banks. But as those banks opened more branches and increased interest rates after the war, the postal banking system fell out of favor and the federal government shut it down.

The Great Recession has led to calls for the revival of postal banks as many cash-strapped households have been forced to seek payday loans and other alternative financial products.

A Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey found that about 9.6 million households in 2013 had no one with a bank account. An additional 24.8 million households had accounts but also used alternative financial services, such as payday loans.

""It's harder for people with less money to use their money, and much more expensive,"" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of Georgia professor and author of the book ""How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation and the Threat to Democracy.""

Many poor areas lack bank branches, but most communities have a post office, said Katherine Isaac, a consultant to the postal workers union who has been organizing the Campaign for Postal Banking.

""Even if we put all the payday lenders out of business, there's a concern that there's still no place to go,"" Isaac said. ""The banks aren't there. They've abandoned those communities. But the post office is there.""

The Postal Service is the most popular federal agency — 84% of respondents have a positive view of it, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll.

""I would guess that a lot of people would trust the post office teller with their money more than these Wall Street traders,"" said Baradaran, an advocate for postal banks. ""There's a sense that the post office is a dinosaur, but it's not a shark.""

Congress would have to pass legislation allowing post offices to take deposits and make loans. But the Postal Service could use existing authority to increase some offerings, such as expanding check cashing to include other government and payroll checks and broadening money orders into bill payment service, supporters said.

""This is not a cash cow for the post office,"" Baradaran said. ""But it could save them.""

Do I have toxic masculinity simply because I enjoy violent content like video games and movies? Or because I like characters like Duke Nukem and the like?

"I am a market socialist that believes absentee ownership (whether of a stock or home or some capital good) is illegitimate. Why do you disagree? Hello,

I am a market socialist. I have like 400 posts about this. If you are curious as to any aspect of how I envision it working I'd be happy to answer. Questions about finance are what I expect the most about. The answer for that lies in crowdfunding, credit unions, the bond market (which is already bigger than the stock market), and a pseudo stock market (basically time limited profit %).

To me, capitalism amounts to the ultimate state interference in the market mechanism. Basically, the idea is this. In order for a capitalist to get profit  their employees must generate more than they cost in wages. Why can't employees demand that they get the full value of their work? Because that would be classified as stealing from the company. The police would be called.

Frankly the whole wage system is fairly flawed with its incentive structure but I can elaborate more on that in the comments if you would like.

Ultimately, private ownership of the MOP is state interference on behalf of the capital class in a way that effectively subsidizes them.

Why is it illegitimate?

Well, if I perform a service or produce a product do i get get charge for it forever? Like, say company a makes cars and they buy a robot from company B to help produce those cars. Company a buys it from B. Great. B deserves compensation (I am not saying they don't). But B can't charge A for years and years if A owns it. A would be paying for a service long since provided.

This logic can be applied to landlords as well and ik this sub  loves landlords....

The way I see it, absentee ownership is basically the state forcing working people to pay for a service no longer provided.

I expect many of you to disagree. Why do you do so? Why should absentee ownership be a thing?",Liberal

"Singaporean healthcare Singapore, being an eastern capitalist society, is known for having an efficiency and mastery of technology that is able to rival Japan, China, and Hong Kong. But to some, Singapore’s best economic reform comes from her healthcare system. It uses a system of mixed financing complementing a system with 3 main institutions. Medisave, a mandatory savings account in which the employee and the employer, must deposit part of their paycheck in. It is used to pay for insurance and medical bills, but deliberately designed to not cover any one medical expense. The second institution is Medishield, which is a health insurance program. But because of medisave, medishield is very affordable. Finally there is medifund, a last ditch endowment for anybody who cannot afford their medical expenses. This system alongside large government subsidies in to healthcare, allow for Singapore to provide some of the best healthcare in the world at just 4% gdp spent on medical expenses.(The UK is 9% and the USA 18%). This is a system that is proposed as a replacement to traditional universal healthcare, because it gets better results at lower costs. Others claim the system as infeasible to use in most western countries, due to Singapore’s unique economic system. What do you think? Can this system be used everywhere else?

"Day #6 of me posting a Socialist Leader for every day in January - Nyerere **JULIUS NYERERE (1922-1999)**

Neyerere was born into the family of a cheif of the Zanaki People on the 13th April 1922, during his childhood he stayed with his mother (one of his father's many wives) and assited her with farming and other domestic tasks. the communal living style of the Zanaki people would later have an infuence on the Political beliefs of Nyrere. During the 1930s, due to beings a cheif's son Nyerere was allowed a western style education, during his education he was noted as an exellent student, it was here that he was first exposed to Christianity, becoming a Catholic in 1942 following the death of his father. He adopted the ''Christian name'' of Julius following his conversion, although was said to have remaked that the custom of taking a Christian name following a batism was ''silly''. Between 1943-47 Nyerere was in higher education at the Makerere collage in Kampala. During the late 1940s Nyerere worked as a teacher, and briefly as a price inspector for the local government. during this time he met, fell in love with and subsequently became informally engaged to Maria Gabriel (despite being in an arranged marrage to a young girl back in his father's village) at the same time he also began to become involved in politics joining the Tanganyika African Association (which wanted decolonisation and liberation from Imperialism for Tanganyika) between 1949-52 He wet abroad to study at Edinburgh Univercity. Following his return to Tanganyika in 1953, Nyerere Became an active decolonisation activist, he urged fellow anti-Imperialist to be as non-Violent as possible and is alleged to have been an an adirer of Mahatma Gandhi's non-Violent campaigns in India.

Following growing Pressure form the Tanganyika African Union (of which Nyerere was a prominent member) the British eventually Left Tanganyika in 1961. In 1962 Nyerere, who by this point was already a well know political and anti-colonial figure, was elected president. He would rule the country from between 1962-1985, during this time he pursued agricultural collecitvisation, education and literacy campaigns, and forged close links with other Socialist Nations - Notably Mao's China. Despite his close links with Marxist states, Nyerere was not a Marxist-Leninist and while he was in Office Nyerere delevloped his own unique form of African Socialism called [*Ujamaa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujamaa)*.* In 1964 Zanzibar unified with Tanganyika to form the nation today known as Tanzania. In 1967 Nyerere issued the Arusha declation that afffermed his and his party's commitment to building a democratic, and Socialist Sociaty in Tanzania. Another notable achievement of Nyerere's was the 1978 invasion of Uganda, which ended the Tyranical reign of Idi Amin. In 1985 he steped down as leader of the CCM and advocated for a multy party system to be developed in the country, he did however continue to avocated for the CCM an Ujamaa in the late 80s- early 1990s.

Nyerere Died of complications from Leukemia in a London Hospital 1999, he was 77. His body was flown back to Tanzania and given a state funeral. Today he is greatly respected in the country and seen as the father of the nation.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733qT1WT9aM)

I started watching the first vid (from like 8min in because the link automatically goes there, lmk if that was a mistake) and it's clear that they are conflating their criticisms of the new pride flag from a visual standpoint (thinking it looks ugly or a unnecessarily complex is ofc a valid opinion) with the legitimacy of the pride movement itself

They think that the pride flag isn't needed, and therefore anyone who uses it is self centered and arrogant. The premise that they state directly is that lgbt people are doing just as well as non lgbt people and don't have any major discrimination

Anyone who looks at data would know that lgbt people still face increased rates of discrimination, violence, and social stigma and rejection. Literally the fact that most lgbt people still have to worry about how to ""come out"" to their family and friends, fearing anything from rejection to outright violence, is enough to justify people using whatever pride flag they like

They're trying to convince their audience that homophobia doesn't exist anymore and thus pride is useless or bad. But they don't bring up any data or reasoning behind their personal opinions of it being fine in the UK

Then they talk about the rapper, while doing so they imply that children who are too young to do xyz, can just cut off their genitals and change their gender

In reality, rarely does any trans child under 18 go through any kind of surgery. And if they do, it would only be after a medical doctor extensively observes the child and their records and finds it medically necessary for their mental health

And that only happens if the doctor is sure the child understands their decision completely. But that happens very rarely

But people like Sargon Akkad or whatever his name is want you to think that a 7 year old can just walk into a doctors office and demand a same day sex realignment surgery

In reality, it's more like a 16 year old talking to multiple doctors for years and everyone coming to the conclusion that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks

The rest of that video is honestly just bad comedy ""haha trans people can't have kids but they'll try to get half the world"" or something like that.

Last thing about that one: straight pride isn't necessary neither is a straight rights campaign because no one is going after the rights of straight people. Is there any political group trying to reduce the rights of straight people? No, but there are many who try to make discrimination against gay people legal.

They outright reject that people rn are campaigning for lgbt rights because they think, for whatever reason, that lgbt rights aren't being threatened and lgbt people don't feel uncomfortable. Both are wrong ofc

2nd video

Okay they're hyperfocusing on one argument they disagree with so far

So people were saying that the shooter was racist because he chose to target a place where mainly Asian people were. Their argument is that since the shooter didn't say he had racist motivations that it's crazy to believe the shooting had anything to do with race. If someone shoots an Asian restaurant and then claims ""I just wanted to shoot a restaurant"" you couldn't blame people for thinking that there are more motivations given the location he chose. Or if someone shoots a black church only to claim ""I just wanted to shoot a church"" then you wouldn't blame people for assuming he still had other motivations.

Even if you disagree with people who say that we have to assume race was a motivation given the context of everything but the shooter's words, you can't just blame people for disagreeing with you or think they're crazy.

Wait the murderer first targeted an Asian spar and then drove 27 miles to shoot another Asian spar?

C'mon, they can't possibly think it's crazy for people to think he is racially motivated

They really think that unless the shooter explicitly says it's about race then it's unjustified to say race was part of it?

Subconscious bias exists for one, oh and he could have been lying. Racial terrorists tend to be treated harsher in court and prison than a random shooter.

Literally if they just thought for longer than a minute they'd figure this out.

It fits their narrative that people pay too much attention to race. That's the only reason why they are criticising people who say it definitely was racially motivated so much. They want their audience to think ""oh so people claim racism when there isn't any"" when it comes to other problems too.

Then they talk about the model minority myth. They mention how Asians on average are performing better than black people on average despite also having had systematic racism. They claim Asians are doing better because of cultural values and then dismiss the idea that slavery is still affecting black people

The systemic racism that black people had to deal with was and is completely different than Asians. And yes, centuries of slavery is actually a good example. They must think that all discrimination is the same, no matter the type or duration.

Third video:

So kids show is basically saying ""families with two dads, two mums, or two non-binary people and any sexuality can be happy"" and that's a bad thing? The show seems kinda boring to me but like I'm not gonna make a video and complain about it being bad lmao

Also, asexual people are accepted in the lgbt community because many asexual people think that there must something wrong with them or their lack of sexual desires may affect their mental health by affecting relationships or whatever, so ofc the lgbt community should be accepting. The lgbt community is about being happy with your sexuality, and asexuality counts.

""agenda"" lol I love it when they use that word cause the agenda is just accepting people for who they are. If I had a nickle for everytime they use that retoric, I'd be a billionnare by now.

Okay now he's saying that pride is forcing labels onto children and making them ""pick a box"". No.... It's about letting everyone know that if you are gay/lesbian/trans/whatever that it's okay and you should feel happy.

If some gay child thinks that something is wrong with them, they might be helped by their cartoons saying ""it's okay to be gay""

People like him think that if we wouldn't mention lgbt stuff at all then no one would feel bad. But our society is heteronormative (the norm is to be straight) so children might be confused if they don't feel heterosexual and we know as a fact that children who are lgbt face more difficulty accepting themselves.

And LMAO, he just said that it's a undeniable fact that the ""cultural forces"" want kids to be gay. That's just so ridiculous. Pride is about accepting people who are lgbt \*because\* many people want them to just be straight.

He says young people don't have a sexual identity yet, well what if someone gets bullied at school because they have two dads? Or because they like to dress differently or whatever. Why does this guy have such a problem with messaging that is literally just ""be proud if you're lgbt or have lgbt people in your family""

I'd love it if this guy pointed out where and when the videos said or even implied that you shouldn't be straight. Notice how these people never talk about anti-lgbt violence or discrimination? It's because they want their audience to think that all this pride stuff is for nothing

Also why would there be such a massive effort to turn kids gay? Like who is doing this and why? There is no monetary or strategic advantage gained from that. His conspiracy theory doesn't make any sense because even the simple question of ""what would anyone have to gain from that"" can't be answered.

"Do you feel the US should defend ukraine? I was recently having a discussion with my right libertarian dad and he basically saw no benefit in defending Ukraine ""I see no strategic reason to defend Ukraine. Sell them lots of guns for sure. But defend them? What possible reason do we have to do that? Who cares if one deeply corrupt government replaces another?""

My response was basically this:
Appeasement doesn't work. It won't stop at Ukraine. Soon it will be the Baltic, maybe Finland or some region the US is not willing to back down on

By not defending Ukraine we are giving Russia a great deal more power and confidence. And giving them control far closer to our ally and one of our biggest trade partners, the EU. It is very difficult to see how an EU russia conflict or a Europe dominated by Russia is a good thing for American interests.

It also plays further into the decline of democracy seen worldwide. Not to say that Ukraine is a perfect democracy or anything (it is pretty corrupt), but it does mean that the russians would be closer to the stronger democracies in Western Europe. Which is cause for concern.

So in short, by not defending Ukraine we are making a hostile power stronger, further threatening global democracy, threatening Europe, and potentially destabilizing the whole region.

What do you think?

Idk if I am convinced by my own arguments, but it is clear that appeasement doesn't work. Like I know what he would say:
""Why should we care if it stops with Ukraine? Who cares if Poland or Finland fell to Russia? Why is it America's problem. Why should we care about Europe at all?""

Fundamentally, I think that it is wrong for a larger country to invade a smaller sovereign nation to ""reclaim"" lost territory of some long lost empire. It.is wrong to bully smaller countries and overthrow their governments. That applies to the US too mind you, we have done some horrid shit.

But in this case, it is pretty clear who is the aggressor.

I believe that it is morally correct to support Ukraine, but morality is rarely a geopolitical guiding principle. If Ukraine fell, Russia wouldn't stop there. But purely geopolitically speaking, why should the US care? Should it? If Europe were dominated by Russia should that even worry us? Why/why not?

"How neoliberalism shifted our economies and what socialdemocracy should do After WW2 mainly socialist/socialdemocratic parties were winning the elections in big European countries and this lead to massive productions of factories and based economies on the production of goods(manufacturing and production in factories).
Due to the rise of neoliberalism and the rise of automatization and the lower need for workers in factories in 1970-1990, new right wing governments shifted economies to being more than 50% focused on the production of services. This now meant that more people are working in the services industry, 
The socialdemocratic response in the late 90's lead to third way economics, which accepted this new economic order, but the goods production was also very low, as the new left wing government focused on workers' rights rather than the economic model.
In developed countries with big production(like Germany) the goods production may take up up to 35%, but in less developed ones the services production is much bigger. This also puts the economy in a much more vulnerable position, especially in times like the Covid-19, and thus can cause big job losses.
In my opinion, what socialdemocrats should do, is, not necessarily scrap the current model, but make sure that the goods industry is strengthened to above 30% and, if possible, to also strengthen agriculture to a maximum of 5%(for example) while also putting more protection over the services industry. A way to do this is by running government investments for production of goods.

"What are your thoughts monopoly tax in the US? 
I think we can all agree that one of the leading problems in the American economy today is the high high degree of consolidation we have. There are a few firms that dominate most markets.

One solution is anti-trust, and I am all for that, but since the federal government doesn't seem to be able to get anything done I was thinking about what could be done on the state or local levels.

This led me to the idea of a ""monopoly tax"".

Here's how it would work:

If a firm controls say 80% (I'm not an expert, this number can vary, I just pulled 80 out of my ass) of the market, then they have to pay a 20% (another number pulled out of my ass) on their profits. This money is then put to one of a few purposes: funding social programs, improving local infrastructure, or my personal favorite, public investment/low interest loans into competitors to the firm. This way a successful firm cannot form a long term monopoly because as they grow larger and more successful they necessairly create more competitors and thus lower their overall market share and therefore this prevents the negatives of monopoly.

Possible objections:

Won't this raise prices for consumers?
Not according to this article: https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/monopoly/effect-of-taxes-on-monopoly-equilibrium-with-diagram/17081#:~:text=If%20the%20government%20imposes%20a,is%20like%20a%20fixed%20cost.&text=Hence%20the%20equilibrium%20in%20the,and%20price%20will%20remain%20unchanged.

Also, competition would force the price down to meet supply and demand options

Won't this face the same political issues we see on the federal level?
Yes, but states tend to have more homogenous political bases, i.e. California tends to stay democratic and Texas tends to stay republicans. Are there democrats in Texas and Republicans in Cali? Yes. But the majority tends to stick with one party, and so legalisation doesn't have to have bi partisan support to pass, unlike on the national level. Take a guess which party won't support it....

Wouldn't companies aim to be just below the stated market share?
Perhaps, but if that's the case then u have competition and the effect you are trying to prevent doesn't happen.

So yeah, what are your thoughts?

Thanks!",Liberal

"Internationalist, rebel, fathers shadow - Friedrich Adler Hello friends and comrades,

&#x200B;

after the last effortpost was about Victor Adler, I noticed that there was another famous person that I mentioned in this piece. Victors son, Friedrich Adler. A curious rebel, always in the shadow of his famous father with a lot of energy for the movement. So today I'd like to talk about Friedrich Adler.

&#x200B;

**Birth and upbringing**

Friedrich Wolfgang Adler was born on July 9th 1879 in Vienna. As mentioned before, Victor Adler (then only a physician) was his father. His mother Emma (born Braun) was the sister of the German Social Democrats Heinrich and Adolf Braun as well as an ardent socialist at heart. Raised in Vienna in good schools, he learned a lot about the probems of working class people and his fathers occupation as physician helped with that.

Victor always thought that Friedrichs unstable health alongside his leaning for fanaticism would not be fruitful for a political career. Instead, his father persuaded Friedrich to go to Switzerland after his *Matura* (final high school exam/A-level exam) to study. Friedrich went to Zürich and started his studies in Physics with his diploma as teacher in Physics and Mathematics in 1897. His Ph.D. came in 1902, again in Physics. While in Zürich he befriended famous scientist Albert Einstein, with whih he would share a life-long friendship.

&#x200B;

**First steps into the workers movement**

In 1909 both Adler and Einstein applied for the new post as professor for Theoretical Physics in Zürich, but Adler rescinded his application in favor of Einstein. Why he rescinded his application isn't sure, most say it was to better engage in the local workers movement.

Already in 1897 Adler joined the *Verband der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie in der Schweiz* (Organisation of the Austrian Social Democracy in Switzerland) and from 1898 onwards as writer for the Swiss newspaper *Volksrecht* (whose Chief Editor Adler would be from 1910 to 1911). Alongside this, in 1901 Adler took up a leading position in the *Verband der Internationalen Arbeitervereine in der Schweiz* (Organisation of International Workers Unions in Switzerland). This would prove as a first omen for his future as an internationally minded Social Democrat. 

Interestingly enough is one small thing in Adlers life story. As Einstein went to the University of Prague in 1911, he recommended Friedrich Adler to take up his former posting in Zürich as his sucessor. But Adler refused this offer. Instead, in the same year he returned to Vienna - becoming one of the four Party Secretaries (alongside Otto Bauer) and editor for *Der Kampf* (The fight), the theoretical monthly paper of the SDAPÖ. Here he showed his interest for an internationalist and pacifist course but remained alone with this. Instead, he set his hopes on the Zweite Internationale (Second Internationale) to keep the peace in Europe, especially as the Balkans began to crumble once again.

&#x200B;

**First World War**

As a pacifist and antimilitarist, Friedrich Adler was against the war and the great hoorah of the European nations for this conflict. Adding to this, the Second Internationale weakened and dismantled itself as most members supported their nations in the war, known as *Burgfriedenspolitik* (Union Sacrée, Party Peace) as well as the position the SDAPÖ took, supporting the Monarchy in the war against Serbia and Russia. He even believed that this position of the party would strengthen the Tsarist Reaction. After a matialistic-patriotic piece by Chief Editor Friedrich Austerlitz in the *Arbeiter-Zeitung* (Workers Paper) in October 1914, Friedrich started is way into isolationism - attacking Prime Minister Stürkgh and his policies in regards to the war as well as the party and his own father, who was leader of the party.

Friedrich didn't serve in the military, as did a lot of higher-ups in the Party. On October 20th 1916, he held a very sharp attack against the party leadership, completing his isolationism in the party. One day later, a weapon would be his new tool.

&#x200B;

**The Shooting of Stürkgh**

One day after the fateful speech, on October 21st 1916, Friedrich Adler killed Austrian Prime Minister Karl Stürkgh in the Dining Hall of the famous Viennese Hotel Meissl & Schadn with a pistol. The reactions in the party were distant, Friedrich Austerlitz wrote that the action was *""\[...\] der ganzen sozialistischen Ideenwelt fremd und unbegreiflich.""* (foreign and incomprehensible to the socialist world of ideas), adding that Adler was a human  *„der einem Wahne folgt“*  (following an illusion) committing himself to  „*unseligen Tat \[…\] im Fanatismus der Selbstzerstörung \[…\] selbst dahin gibt und grausam vernichtet, was noch ein reiches Blühen versprach.“* (an unncessary action in fanatisicm and self-destruction, sacrificing himself and destryoing violently what promised a rich blossoming).

This action showed a great irony: Friedrich Adler, a pacifist, killed the Prime Minister.

In the trial, Adler used this as a floor for agitation against his own party, for a reckoning. Saying that the bureaucratic apparatus has taken over the party, he launched his hate primarily against the Refomist Karl Renner, accusing him of cowardice and loss of principle. The tip of the iceberg was, that Adler accused the party of becoming the reactionary element in Austria itself - leaving the ideas of the Second Internationale. Adler justified his action to start a process of rethinking in the party and if possible in society, being an assassination against Austrian Morale - establishing the psychological foundation for coming mass actions in the country.

As expected, Friedrich Adler was sentenced to death. Oddly enough, shortly after the trial Austerlitz changed his opinion of Adler in his articles, saying that he was at least a *""Märtyrer seiner Überzeugung“* (martyr of his own belief) who sacrificed himself in ardent bravery to serve Social Democracy and its ideas. A pardon of the newly crowned Emperor Karl I. reduced his sentence to 18 years imprisonment, which was cancelled after Karl gave Adler an amnesty as one of his last acts as Emperor in November 1918.

Adler was freed on November 9th 1918 and returned to Vienna on the next day awaited by his brother Siegmund and his father Victor.

Surprisingly, the party didn't follow his ideas, rather confirming the party leadership and adding karl Renner into the main leadership board, the *Parteivorstand*. But the masses received the message, slowly but surely the party would transition away from supporting the war outright.

&#x200B;

**Friedrich Adler as hero of the people in the ""Austrian Revolution""**

Shortly after his liberation from prison, the SDAP as well as the Communists regarded Adler as hero of the people, the latter tried to get him to join their movement by granting him the position of Party leader - which he both refused. Instead, Adler reamained true with the Social Democratic Party, maybe because he thought that after the death of his father (November 11th 1918, one day after he returned) it was the right thing to do. As one of the main figures in the party, he took over the lead for the workers councils - defeating the first try of Communists to take over on November 12th 1918 but the situation remained tense with a communist uprising in Hungary and Bavaria. Another try of taking over (helped by leaders of the Third Internationale) was again defeated in June 1919. His actions, as Otto Bauer said it, saved Austria.

&#x200B;

**The Internationalist**

The party reshuffled its posts in the leadership after the death of Friedrichs father Victor. Party leadership went to Karl Seitz (a Reformist) with Otto Bauer being the real man in charge as Chief Ideologue. bauers idea of *Integraler Sozialismus* (Integral Socialism - unting the split workers movement) was recognised as a necessity by Adler. Therefore, he led the *Internationale Arbeitsgemeinschaft sozialistischer Parteien* (International Working Group of Socialst Parties). The idea behind this organisation was to lead the reformists towards revolutionary action while calming the Soviet Regine down and bringing it to a social democracy. But as the first talks showed that the trenches were too deep, the group returned back to the Second Internationale and fusioned with it to the *Sozialistische Arbeiterinternationale* (Socialist Workers Internationale) in 1923. Up until 1940, Friedrich Adler would remain leader of this Internationale.

Julius Braunthal, his secretary, said the following about Adler:

 *„Er war aber der Kopf der Internationale. Er steuerte ihre Politik in den zahllosen Kommissionssitzungen, die in den Perioden zwischen den Kongressen über seine Anregung zusammentraten, und in den Sitzungen des Büros und der Kongresse, deren Beratungen und Beschlüsse er durch Memoranden vorbereitete. Er stellte durch die Vorschläge der Tagesordnung der Konferenzen die Probleme im Einklang mit seiner Politik zur Debatte und beeinflusste durch die Wahl der Referenten die politische Linie ihrer Behandlung.“* 

(But he was the head of the Internationale. He led its politics in the countless meetings that happned in the periods between the congresses assembling over his proposal, as well as in the meetings of the bureau and the congresses, whose talks and resolutions he prepared with memoranda. Through putting the recommendations of the congresses agenda, he set the problems in accordance with his politics to debate and influenced through the vote of the speakers the political line of their treatment.)

But this Internationale soon dissolved. In 1933 its last congress occured - in 1940 it was dissolved as he head to flee Paris during the German advance into France. Before the flight, adler helped the SPD in exile by moderating the sides and supporting the resisitance in Germany itself.

&#x200B;

**Informal leader of Soial Democratic Exile**

After the Anschluss in 1938, a lot of the illegal Social Democrats had to flee Austria and the Exile in Brno in Czechoslovakia. Alread in March, the Organisation fled to Brussels where the *Revolutionären Sozialisten* (the resistiance in Austria up to that point) should fuse with the *Auslandsbüro der österreichischen Sozialisten* (Foreign Bureau of the Austrian Socialists, ALÖS) to the *Auslandsvertretung der österreichischen Sozialisten* (Foreign Representation of the Austrian Socialists, AVOES). Friedrich Adler became a leading figure of this organisation - becoming the de facto leader after the death of Otto Bauer in July 1938 in Paris.

As mentioned, AVOES and the Internationale had to flee - they went to New York with some of AVOES estabilshing another office in London. They could not achieve a unified representation for Austria though. The leader Joseph Buttinger left AVOES in 1941, Adler remained as now leader. In early 1942 he established the Austrian Labor Commitee (ALC).

&#x200B;

**In the wilderness - later life and death**

Slowly but surely, Adler left the work of the ALC - criticising parts of its work. In 1944, he rescinded his post as ALC boss, transfering it to Otto Leichter.

Returning to Europe in 1946, Adler was confronted with the question of the KPÖ towards the new SPÖ about its position to the Anschluss. While Renner in his position as Federal President was able to distance himself from this, Friedrich Adler couldn't. He saw himself as an Internationalist, German and then Austrian. The reactions to this were quite strong and only hardened the belief that he should leave politics. First closing the office in Brussels he went to Switzerland to his daughters, working on the History of the Workers Movement.

Adler published the correspondence between his father and Karl Kautsky as well as with August bebel in 1954. The biography he planned about his father was never finished as he lacked the power for it in his later years. His last visit to Vienna in 1952 for the 100th birthday of his father was a triumphant one, greeted warmly by the party.

Friedrich Adler died on January 2nd 1960 in Zürich aged 80. He was buried in the grave of his father at Viennas Zentralfriedhof with a street named after him in Favoriten in 1989.

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

Friedrich Adler remains a bit of a mystery to this day, his whole life being filled with dialectics. As son of the party founder he had to walk in great shoes, as pacifist he killed a prime minister and as ""defender of Austria"" he saw himself as German, as Internationalist remaining calm but unclear about the main line. Especially his belief in Socialism bordered towards devout religiousness. he followed a way between Social Democracy and Bolshevism in the interwar years, but had to see it fail.

Still, his achievements for Austrian Social Democracy were and still are great ones. He was the hero very few people talk about today. While being a mystery, I was able to learn a few things of his life for mine and I regard him as a living dialectic - something that I have to live with myself. But Friedrich Adler showed me that it is a necessity to live such a dialectic: remaining realistic but seeking for a better future, a utopia so to say.

I've already referenced numerous books and articles that they could read and have made mention of numerous foreign interventions all around the world but they're still stuck in this ""America #1"" mindset.

We live in an extremely educated area so Im surprised that the propaganda has pierced their heads. 

However, I don't know how much more literacy of American politics and foreign policy I would expect from a group of people that cant keep a vape from their mouth for more than 10 seconds. 

Maybe they're completely brainwashed and I should separate myself. 

But, if anyone has anything that is completely authoritative and leaves no room for interpretation that'll sway them then that will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks",Liberal

"Nearing the 9th anniversary of his death and with relative hindsight in the time since, what are the community's thoughts on Hugo Chàvez? Amid a lot of recent reading on Latin American history and noticing that there hasn't been that recent of a discussion in this sub on this topic, I was curious to see what everyone thinks of Chàvez's legacy. 

My current perception is that he was an incredibly gifted politician and strongly principled towards socialism, nationalizing key industries and made himself a prominent adversary of Yankee imperialism. His advocacy for Panhispanism and Latin American integration is also a high mark of his ideology personally, and seemed to always advocate for the global south on the world stage. 

On the other hand, I feel he made several policy errors and failed to adapt to the conditions of the world economy amid the end of the commodities boom. For better or worse, he was a master of propaganda and messaging, and his eventual use of public funds for these purposes is detrimental to his legacy, and of course something that has continued there to this day. 

Essentially, my basic knowledge has him as a complicated figure, an inspiring and gifted populist who also made several severe errors and perhaps moved too hastily in overwhelming Venezuela's economy in the wake of the commodities boom.

"The root of Democracy. ""Some equate Democracy with equality and liberty. Equality and liberty are no doubt the deepest concern of Democracy. But the more important question is what sustains equality and liberty? 
Some would say that it is the law of the state which sustains equality and liberty. This is not a true answer. What sustains equality and liberty is fellow-felling. What the French Revolutionists called fraternity. The word fraternity is not an adequate expression. The proper term is what the Buddha called, Maitree. Without Fraternity Liberty would destroy equality and equality would destroy liberty. If in Democracy liberty does not destroy equality and equality does not destroy liberty, it is because at the basis of both there is fraternity. Fraternity is therefore the root of Democracy.""

"The Fire Rises: Socialism or Death “**The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters**.” ***-Antonio Gramsci***

I browse reactionary websites to keep an eye on the scoundrels, expectedly their articles are almost all rubbish however this day a certain article  piqued my interest, ""hmmm"" this sound interesting I said and read it in full; as I read through the article at first bumbling and then in alarm I realized that a catastrophe may be upon us. This article was well written with legitimate sources and concise, the cutting facts of the article are most pertinent.

1. University of Virginia poll – 85% of Republicans concerned about anti-white discrimination – Immigration is the top concern:
2. University of Chicago poll – 75% of the 21 million Americans who sympathize with the Jan. 6 protestors top political concern is “the great replacement” [https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2022/01/07/study-january-6-riot-caused-by-fear-of-demographic-change/](https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2022/01/07/study-january-6-riot-caused-by-fear-of-demographic-change/)
3. Thirty to forty percent of white Americans say that white identity is important to them.”[https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-disturbing-surprisingly-complex-relationship-between-white-identity-politics-and-racism](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-disturbing-surprisingly-complex-relationship-between-white-identity-politics-and-racism)""
4. **Newsweek poll – “23% of Republican men have a favorable view of white nationalism”–** [**https://www.newsweek.com/23-percent-republican-men-have-favorable-view-white-nationalists-poll-1614973**](https://www.newsweek.com/23-percent-republican-men-have-favorable-view-white-nationalists-poll-1614973)

The article was titled ""Is America ready for white identity politics"", it makes a convincing case that there is ***a huge latent frustration that can be tapped into by fascists that can be utilized for political victory.*** White people(non-Hispanic) make up 57% of the American population, the left is never winning without a significant portion of them.

Let there be no doubt about this, the left is growing this year alone ,3000 people joined the obscure CPUSA and 2000 the rejuvenating IWW, however if the left does not act and fast reactionaries might steal our thunder. Inflation and economic malaise is rising, the whole imperial project is crumbling and people are ***angry***  they want change, however ***due to the duopoly their anger is directed into the culture war and worse to most normies the LEFT still equals liberals, I believe the left can tap into this white American discontent and preventing it from metastasizing by;***

1. Distinguishing themselves from liberals by running candidates **separately on a broad front with other leftists** ***(CPUSA is doing such in long beach).***
2. Arming and organizing minorities and leftists, even if the fascists fail there will be many terror attacks on minorities and the left.
3. Attempt to appeal to the white working class, with a strong working class economic program ***The simple truth is that poor whites don't vote that much, simply campaigning and propagandizing among them will win a huge amount of them over*****,** 
4. ***Pandering towards various racial groups including white people in a rhetorical manner(last resort)***",Liberal

"Am I a part of the problem? 
In no way is this post supposed to make me or my parents look like victims. I just need some perspective because I’m really struggling with this. So both my parents are conservatives almost in their 60s. They are both understanding people and have very good hearts. I myself am on the very opposite political spectrum as them. The thing that stresses me out is that they voted for trump. They are not trump supporters they just voted conservative because they always have because the way they grew up or whatever. I’m just so scared that my friends will find out they voted for trump and hate them. Neither of them are really educated about politics at all because they are constantly working and barely have any time to themselves. (I know that’s not an excuse it’s just what I noticed.) If they fully understood the weight of everything they might have voted differently. I know deep down they are good people that care deeply about people. And for some reason I feel guilty for not hating them. Am I a part of the problem for still wanting a good relationship with them? I’ve seen on tik tok some people say “I found out my parents voted for trump and I cut them off” do I need to do the same to be a good person?

Edit: sorry if this post seems stupid I struggle with ocd fears that make me afraid I’m a bad person all the time, and I can get pretty in my head sometimes. so I made this post to hear other perspectives",Liberal

"What was your cringey political phase? My cringey phase was communist (Marxist Leninist). I was an Obama liberal before 2015. I really started to care about politics during the 2016 primaries and the following election. I got really into Sanders. After he lost and Hilary lost to Trump, I got politically disillusioned and fell down the ""alt left"" pipeline. I found anarchism on reddit and got inspired by that. I also started to learn about Marxism, and it made sense to me at the time. Frustrated with anarchism's apparent lack of real world impact, I decided to become a Marxist. It all went downhill from there. After that I quickly fell into the echo chamber trap of historical revisionism and dictator apologia. Thankfully I didn't stay there. I couldn't self-delude myself into believing that the communist regimes were good or that everything bad about them could be dismissed as propaganda or justifiable. I realized how stupid promoting revolution was. I also didn't like the way communists treated theorists and leaders like they were prophets. So I decided that I couldn't continue to consider myself part of that ideology. Liberty and democracy are much to important for that. Looking at the work of social democrats to improve life for working class and ordinary people, I decided to embrace social democracy.

"Capitalism & Depression Content warning: Depression and suicide

(Narrated version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPFxQhA4lYk))

Depression seems to be a common problem in leftist circles. When I gained class consciousness, I realized things that ended up hurting me to a level of pain that makes me contemplate whether being alive is worth it. It’s the realization that what makes this world a horrible place is a system that is entirely unnecessary. A system that robs us of most of our day’s time, our energy, and our humanity. A system that makes it near impossible to self actualize or enjoy life without being hindered by wage slavery.

I’m comfortable now saying publicly that I’ve suffered with suicidal thoughts and tendencies for a long time. Now I’m here as a graduate who realizes they didn’t really have a childhood, and now looking towards the future, realizes that adulthood most likely isn’t going to make up for such a loss. A lack of friends when I was younger isn’t terribly difficult to fix, but escaping the mental health issues that arise from working under capitalism is an entirely new magnitude of difficulty.

Sadly, I am not writing this because I have answers, instead, I hope to analyze what causes depression under capitalism, and will look at mental health issues as an environmental problem.

There are a few main factors that cause people to be depressed. Three prevalent ones are:

1. Feeling that you or your work/efforts are meaningless
2. Feeling trapped or unable to escape a problem
3. Feeling that a problem is outside of your control

The first of these three has to do with meaning. When a person’s labor or existence in society isn’t valued, they will end up coming to the conclusion that their future existence either isn’t wanted or necessary. It’s why a lot of depressed people consider themselves a burden. Sometimes even blaming themselves and reminiscing on problems which make their condition even worse. Capitalism in its current practice does exactly the kinds of things that can cause these problems. It does not fully appreciate the labor of its workers as they are not fully rewarded for their toil. Not only is surplus value extracted from them, meaning they don’t get the full worth of their work, but additionally, [their pay doesn’t keep up with inflation, nor production output](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/10/03/us-wages-have-been-rising-faster-than-productivity-for-decades/#246f24c57342). Of course, pay isn’t everything, someone can easily decide that a low-paying job is worth it as long as it is fun or meaningful. Problem is, work under capitalism isn’t meaningful either. Putting aside the existence of bullshit jobs, workers under capitalism are alienated from their own labor. While capitalists do not value labor, the same goes for the laborer. A capitalist doesn’t need *you specifically*, they just need someone who can perform similar tasks to you. This leads them to [treat mildly difficult employees, such union organizers, as easily replaceable nuisances](https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/26/technology/tesla-uaw-firings/index.html). Nobody likes being arbitrarily let go, but when businesses realize that reducing labor costs increases profits, your interests in the security of your job are no longer valued by the person who has control of said security.

The second thing that causes depression is the feeling of being trapped or being unable to escape an issue or problem. Putting aside that moving to a better country or state for most people is unrealistic, capitalism isn’t a problem we can run away from. No matter if you move to Germany or Denmark, Vietnam or China, you will not be able to ""move away"" from capitalism. The ability to bail from an uncomfortable situation is important for one’s mental well-being as it does not force them into situations that can deteriorate their mental health. Unfortunately, this system is something we cannot bail from. Capitalism is not voluntary. It constantly has a gun to your head that forces you to work to survive. If you decide not to participate, if you decide to bail, you have effectively surrendered your life in capitalism. This requirement of work to survive is also part of the reason that some people are forced into careers they don’t enjoy. [A majority of workers are disengaged from their work](https://www.inc.com/sonia-thompson/68-percent-of-employees-are-disengaged-but-there-i.html), and it’s for a damn good reason. When people are unhappy with their work, or want better wages for their time, it is not common that an alternative job opportunity will arise. People do not willingly pick bad jobs. They are there for reasons outside of their control.

Speaking of control, a perceived lack of it is the third major factor that causes depression. In psychology, it is considered an “external locus of control” which means that you believe your problems are due to factors outside of your control such as luck. In this case, that thing outside of your control is capitalism. Many people with an internal locus of control have tried to tell themselves that they can control their material conditions under capitalism. That if they just “work hard enough” they will be OK. General statistics would disprove this. Around 60% of Americans made under 40k in 2020, and 50% of them made under 30k (US SSA Wage Statistics 2020). As an individual, [these kinds of salaries would get you considered as “low-income”](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/20/15343720/housing-income-limits) in [places where most of America’s population presides](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_population_map.png). Considering how common it is for Americans to be low income, I have my doubts about people who say that working hard will allow you to escape this problem. 60% of Americans certainly aren’t lazy; that’s ridiculous. There is a different problem afoot, and that’s capitalism. Problem is, our efforts might not be effective enough to make people *feel* that they have control over their capitalist problems. While many are now starting unions, going to protests, or engaging in direct action, these forms of praxis alone are not always sufficient enough to form the revolutionary optimism needed to pull people out of their capitalist-caused external locus of control. We may fight, but many workers still have to suffer in the meantime, which can be discouraging. Your will to live shouldn’t have to originate from the struggle against what stole it in the first place.

To explain this better, I’ll use an analogy. If you’re in an abusive relationship, your life’s meaning shouldn't have to be about leaving it, putting up with it, or reliving it when it’s over. It should be about living beyond abuse. Same goes for capitalism. It is depressing to make one’s entire life about fighting the system that abuses them when their life could be about flourishing from the absence of said system. Nobody’s meaning should have to come from fighting what abuses them. Their meaning should come from self actualization and true fulfillment. This does not mean I am against direct action, but I do have my critiques. We are in a system where change is made intentionally slow, and this will inevitably kill us. Both mentally and physically. We are in time sensitive situations that unveil the weaknesses of politicians taking their time or trying to be “civil” while their constituents inhabit a living hell. I am not here for gradualism, nor am I here to fight a long time for changes that will be rolled back instantly. I do not mind being a revolutionary, but I want the ideas of our comrades to matter. Considering how much the realization of our suffering hurts, I’d hate to see this system live long enough for someone else to have to feel the same way.

As someone who likes to dabble in psychology, I happen to have my own opinions about certain arguments within the subject. One of those being nature vs nurture. The argument over whether your genetics are more or less important in determining your behavior than the environment you were raised in. While I acknowledge that certain behaviors will arise from your genetics such as likelihood of schizophrenia and type of temperament, it is my opinion that generally how you were raised, and more importantly, your environment, will affect your behavior more than genetics. This is what leads me to come to the theory that mental health problems, and in this case specifically, depression, are environmental issues. Again, I do acknowledge that chemical imbalances exist, but for many other people this might not be the case. Curing depression isn’t easy; like dreams, psychologists admit they don’t entirely know what happens on a neurological level when these things occur. This might be because we are trying to look at depression as purely a neurological process or something we can cure the same way we would a physical illness. Certainly, it is simpler and easier to ""fix"" an individual than the environment they preside in.

A therapist isn’t going to be able to change your material conditions, nor is any brand of depression medication. While they may allow you to look at the situation differently, it ultimately won’t change the environment you’re in. [During the economic crisis of 2008, and for some time after, there was a spike in suicides, upwards of around ten thousand of them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniehaiken/2014/06/12/more-than-10000-suicides-tied-to-economic-crisis-study-says/#64e158ad7ae2). This is not a coincidence, and [studies that have analyzed larger periods of time were able to find a correlation between rising unemployment rates and a higher risk of suicide](https://www.thejournal.ie/unemployment-4500-deaths-by-suicide-1930270-Feb2015/). As I said already, people don’t like being arbitrarily let go by being fired, so it makes sense that their mental health can spiral downwards as unemployment becomes a problem for them.

We are trapped in this environment. It’s either unemployment and the suicide that follows, or actually having a job, and suffering alienation while surrendering your humanity just to be given the capitalist privilege of being allowed to live.

As I have said at the beginning of this essay, I don’t have solutions. I really wish I did because if that was the case, I wouldn’t mentally be in this place right now. This all just happens to be my best understanding of the problem at hand, and how it might be affecting other people. Maybe, I’m not meant to be here. I certainly don’t think I will be able to handle this absurd environment, and will have to take the only avenue that is available for me to escape it. I did not suffer during my childhood only to be given an adulthood that forces me to deal with even greater problems when all I want to do is recover. While I still have some hopes for the future that might save me from some of the emotional problems I associate with capitalism, I feel as if I am dangling my life by thin threads.

"Did I Overreact to this sexist remark? I need some help understanding an encounter I just had with my brother. He is generally not very empathetic toward women's issues or the goals of feminism, and at one time we were both entrenched in the conservative movement, which led to us forming the opinion that third wave feminism was pointless man-hating. We haven't been in that movement for quite some time, now (it was just a rebellious phase against the largely liberal culture we grew up in), but it sometimes influences the way I perceive his comments. Since then, I've become much more involved in the movement for gender equality. This started when I came out and began diving into the ligbtq+ community, which generally supports racial and gender equality. This encouraged my interest in feminism, to which I'm fairly new. So I wanted to post the interaction here to ask if I'm overreacting. 
 
My brother showed me a picture of a fairly unattractive man and said ""if he slapped your girl's ass, would you beat him?"" I said ""if he slapped MY ass, I'd call the police bc it's completely unacceptable to touch a woman like that without consent"" and he said ""it's a meme, Meg"" as if I was sucking the fun out of a joke by pointing out that it perpetuates rape culture and degrades women. (I emphasized that ""MY"" because I don't think the situation should be framed from the perspective of the woman's partner. It implies that she is their property and therefore the crime has really been committed against THEM, not her. It also suggests that she needs her partner to do something because she can't handle the situation herself even though she is the one who has been sexually assaulted.) 

Meme or not, I didn't think this was an okay thing to say. 

Keep in mind that we share a love for dark/edgy humor when it's done well, and there has never been any truth in the racist, sexist, or homophopic jokes we would tell. We're both of the mind that such jokes are best used when the intention is to show the ridiculousness of those beliefs. (Example: Making a joke about how black people are criminals points out the ridiculousness of that stereotype and ultimately makes racists, not black people.) However, I don't think this particular ""joke"" does that. The sexism of it is not the part that is supposed to be funny. The part that is supposed to be funny is that the man is not attractive. The sexism and perpetuation of rape culture lies in the setup, not the punchline. Which makes me feel like pointing it out is important because the person making the joke may not have even realized that it had these undertones. Do you think I'm overreacting or do you think the joke was inappropriate? Please give your honest opinion, I'm not afraid to be wrong.",Liberal

"Democracy, Capitalism and our conception of man We are living through a crisis of democracy, I think this statement is rather uncontroversial (in this subreddit at least anyways). In this post I want to discuss some of the possible reasons for that.

*How capitalism kills democracies.* Now I do not know how controversial it is to say that capitalism kills democracies. But I think that that is the case and here is why:

1. It leaves people behind.
2. It fails education
3. it causes massive inequality
4. Greed is not everything.
5. Possible solutions1- *it \[capitalism\] leaves people behind*  
This is an issue for democracy, since people who are being left behind often feel alienated and powerless, and ask themselves why should I even bother to go out and vote? I cannot change anything anyways, the elites do whatever they want anyways…This kind of thinking is of course wrong since everyone vote matters the same (well maybe with the exception of the US Presidential elections and other federal elections but I’ll ignore that for now) This often least to people doing one of to things:Radicalise, we see that in many poor US states the Republican party is really strong even though the republicans economics effects poor people the most, but why is that?  I think it is because they offer easy solutions. They say it is not your fault that you lost your job, it it because of the immigrants taking our (by that they mean white people) jobs, the Gays and Transes are destroying our culture. There is too much government etc. those are easy solutions, It is not your fault but other peoples and I think that is pretty attraktive when you have lost everything.second: The other thing that could happen is that you just do not vote at all, lose interest and faith in democracy. This is bad too since it makes it pretty hard to win someone who thinks that they cannot change anything anyways. Another group of people that are being left behind are disabled people, since they often can work as much as they would need to to survie on their own under capitalism, and I cannot stress enough that that is really bad since it is absolutely no fault of your own that you are disabled (both mentally and physically) and yet your worth on the makred of the labour force is much much lower simply by your being disabled.  
*It fails education*  
Now This is an issue that can be fixed fairly easily (ill get to that later)  but all to often we do not invest enough into education which is bad since a well educated population that is media literate, has a basic understanding of how since works and what facts are is the base of a working democracy. Also we all to often just teach the wrong stuff (more on that in 5.)  
*It causes massive inequality*  
Inequality is not good for democracy, because it \[democracy\] relies on that everyone has (roughly) equal power, this however this is not achieved under the current economic system.Capitalism leads to wealth inequality due to generational wealth, wealth amassing by the rich (by that I mean it is way easier to get even richer if you are already rich) and the fact that employers have a lot of power, the can control hoe much money you make, when you have free time and such. This wealth that is hold by a few people is a issue that is exaborbaited by the fact that you can spend (almost) everywhere as much money to a party or canidate as you wish. –> hugely unbleached power. This power that the rich gain through their wealth enables them to lobby for economic policies that benefit them not the masses. An example for this is Universal healthcare in the US and Germany\*. In the US poll after poll shows that a huge majority of the US poplulation wants some kind of universal state run healthcare system, yet there is no such thing in the works right now, no bill in the US congress and such. Why? Because the rich bought the politicians to oppose it, personal responsibility or something like that, the marked will solve the issue Muhhh freedom. In Germany poll after poll shows that a huge majority of the population (around 69% as of  last September) wants a single state run insurance in place of the mess of public and private once that we have right now, yet that will not happen since the CDU and FDP belive that that is a bad Idea, free marked something muh.This is not good.  
*Greed is not everything*  
Anothery way capitalism is anti democratic and poisons society is by making greed everything.When Milton Friedman was ask if he ever had any doubt about capitalism in light of the massive inequality \[…\] he awnsered “Do you know any society that does’t run on greed” Do we really should ask ourselfs, if that is the way we want to live. Do we really want to live in a world where only egoism matters, where capital is everything? I do not think that is something we should strive for, I think a world where capital is everything and feelings like compassion, solidarity and altruism do not matter is not a good idea. The current economic system assumes that greed is everything, but it ignores that humans are much more complex than that. Be honest, is greed the motivation for everything you do? Are humans really only egoistic in nature? Do you want to live in a world where greed capital and the stigma grind set are everything? I personally don‘t want to do that. Capitalism however has screwed up the conception of man for many many people. Many people think that greed is everthing that success can only be measured in money, but that leaves out so much ouf the Human nature.I wanna quote here u/virbrevis since they the in really good words when I asked them about it  (on the subs Discord)  
 “I think capitalism promotes quite twisted and terrible social values that conflict with the ideas of, say, community, of family, of co-operation and friendship, capitalism conflicts with humanist and Christian values, and so on.It promotes greed, gluttony, envy, a radical individualism (the atomisation of society). It promotes ruthless competition in every sphere of life, and the commodification of every sphere of life. \[…\] That makes capitalism harmful then to the individual, to society, to politics and to the economy.”  
And I agree with that and it is also not hard to see why that might also cause problems for democracy. When everyone just votes in their one interests, then that becomes a huge issue for democracy. It is supposed to be the rule of the people, but when it becomes ruled be selfish intererst and distrust in one another, that leads to the “atomasiation of society” and also the fall of democracys. This can be observed in hyper capitalist nations like the US.    
*How do we fix this mess?*    
Obviously  there is no one easy solution to such a complex and systemic issue and who claims otherwise is lying. However I think that there are some things that could be done. First we should try to build up a robust welfare state in oder to ensure that nobody is left behind. Then we need to make our education system better and more equal, ensure that everybody can persue their goals as they wish without aquiring massive Student debt. We should also redistribute money and ban party donations lager than a few hundert Euros for private persons and ban companys all together from donating. Franky there is a lot more to this and that could be done in a soc dem / dem soc framework.    
I think that we (leftists in general) should spend more energy on these societal issues. I do not know how to fix that consumerism, but we should try to find an awnser. You can put your ideas and thoughs below here (obvio).

*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

"Evidence of CIA involvement in the Alt Right and Reddit/4chan  I'm gonna post this all across Reddit, 4chan etc because it relates to these communities. This is what I have spent the last month of lockdown doing. I have titled this article, 'The Truth About The Alt Right: A Destruction By Facts and Logic.' Part of the reason I write this article is that I sincerely hope those on the Alt-Right consider its implications and question their beliefs. The other part is that I sincerely hope the left begins to more fully understand the scope of the alt-right itself, but also of the intelligence agencies who, I believe I have shown in this article, are the creators and backers of the alt-right movement. I hope that perhaps they might consider what they could do to combat these influences specifically online.

While the alt-right have money, we have a lot of people. In the article I first outline who the alt right are and what they believe, as well as outlining a fairly orthodox theory of where fascism comes from. I then discuss The Roots of the Alt Right and the connections to intelligence agencies therein, their relationship to the conspiracy theory community and other alternative media. I also give a brief history of 4chan. I then discuss the Alt-Right itself, the alt-right specific theories such as Pizzagate and Qanon, as well as the alt-rights involvement the election of Donald Trump.

From here, I go on to discuss the various different groups and interests who put large amounts of money behind the election of Donald Trump. This money paid for the astroturfing of various forums on the internet, including Reddit and 4chan, by these paid meme magic factories. Those who paid for these factories are some interesting characters, including one Jim Dowson, part of a shadowy group called The Knights Templar International, ruled by a mysterious 'Council of Nine'. Yes, you heard me correctly.

Outside of these interests, I also show the massive and blatant amount of intelligence agency interference in these communities. I then go on discuss the esoteric leanings of many of these Neo Nazi groups implicated in this astroturfing campaign, as well as their own connections to intelligence groups, which are often direct and stark. I discuss generally how these various influences have formed a militant anti left bloc, with global reach and influence as well as considerable militant capabilities. This network forms a Fascist International and has links right to the top of many states. 4Chan and Reddit have been a key media outlet in their growth.

I am aware the article is very long, so if you have a pretty good grasp 4chan/Reddit history, you can skip ahead to the section, Entitled 'The God Emporer Saves Us From His Pedophile Friends' , or, if you want to get straight to the sections most relevant to 4chan and Reddit, you can skip to the section entitled 'Evidence of Glow Posting'. It is from this section of the article that the whole thing grew. I wanted to collect the little evidence I had of glow posting into one document, that lead here and there and now I have over 20,000 words. You will find that at the start of the article in the introduction there are few citations, don't assume that is because I don't use them, I reference 143 sources in total. This is a link to the article. Hope you find it interesting.

"Trump’s CPAC speech- what do you expect from him tomorrow? So..... the Trump CPAC speech is tomorrow..... What do you think will be the focus of his speech?

I despise Trump (obviously) BUT I think that he is a talented showman/huckster. IMO, his speeches are (usually) captivating and entertaining because he always manages to say something controversial or stupid. He always manages to lie or make an ass of himself.

Love him or hate him, most of the country will be interested in what Trump has to say tomorrow, whether they admit it or not. This is an extremely important speech in regards to the future of the Donald Trump brand.

Trump faces a dilemma tomorrow; he is damned if does make “election fraud” the main focus of his speech and damned if he doesn’t make it the main focus. 


*Trump has backed himself into an untenable position.* When he solicits votes for himself or any other GOP candidate he is implicitly suggesting the “election fraud” issue was an anomaly and unlikely to transpire again.

Anything less than total commitment to some kind of extreme measures to fix the “election fraud” will be seen by conservatives as a weak handed response. Anything less than commitment to an armed coup will upset his most ardent and extreme followers.

It will be interesting to see how he attempts to work his way around this issue. The smartest move here might be to take the easy way out- don’t commit to anything and make your speech vague as possible, with no promises or commitments to anything or anyone.

"How do you cope with the fact that a lot of all suffering in this world could be solved if that's what we wanted. A lot of all global issues could be solved if we, as humans, wanted to solve them.
I'll take poverty as an example:
There is plenty of wealth in this world; We could end poverty if we just distributed it evenly. 
But that also means that in order to end world poverty, we all (meaning residents of wealthy nations) would have to lower our standard of living. 
But most people don't want to lower their standard of living. So we're too selfish to do anything about it, even if we could. 

How do you cope with that? That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Edit: I realize my example wasn't perfect. What I was trying to say is that there is a common misconception, that in order to help others, we have to let go of something we value.

If you have a voice use it!

The 1933 Nazi book burnings sparked response from anti-Fascist organizations, Jewish groups, and writers in the United States. American literary organizations provided aid to the rising number of German emerge writers in response to the crisis.

KEY FACTS

* 1  
American newspapers nearly unanimously condemned the book burnings. While some responded with ridicule, others forecast the impending “dark age.”
* 2  
On May 10, 1933, the same day as the book burnings in Germany, nearly 100,000 people marched in New York City for more than six hours to protest events in Germany and the burning of books
* 3  
American author Helen Keller—known for her socialist views and one of whose books was burned—wrote an open letter to German students, affirming the enduring power of ideas against tyranny.

Demand consequences or these book burnings WILL continue!

"Living wage & exploitation of work force Bit of a rant...but I'm just tired of it all. 
I'm mid 30's and my husband is late 20's. My husband and I both have bachelor's degree, we have 2 kids (15 & 13 yr old), and live in Ohio. We both work full time. 

Back story: My degree doesn't help at all (political science), and my husband graduated end of 2019 (mechanical engineering). I had a good paying job, but I refuse to go back to that career field (sales/management). And yes, we have tried to find better paying jobs, but most wouldn't even contact us back (even after interviews)...so we are still looking, but we've HAD to find jobs to live.

 I make $16.30/hr and he makes $17/hr. It's insane how anyone can live on min wage. Min wage in Ohio is $8 something/hr I believe. Living wage for family of 4 in Ohio (with both parents working) is a little over $20/hr (each). 

We are struggling with having anything more than necessities & bills...examples: car pymt, car & health insurance, chiropractor (my last job wrecked my back), gas, rent, electric, food, utilities, credit card, medical bills, and saving a little for Christmas...oh and student loans start up again in Jan...fun... 

It's to the point that my 15 yr old is considering quitting sports to get a job to help the family. He doesn't have his permit yet... mainly because I doubt we can afford the extra car insurance. I'm too scared to even know how much the cost of car insurance will jump up. 

In the end: I know I'm not alone...but when will this exploitation of the work force end? We need living wages in order to keep the economy going.",Liberal

"EU: enemy of workers and immigrants - Brexit: defeat for the bankers and bosses of Europe! https://archive.is/xYApZ

Statement of the Central Committee of the Spartacist League/Britain

JUNE 24 — Standing on our consistent record of proletarian, revolutionary and internationalist opposition to the imperialist-dominated European Union (EU), the Spartacist League/Britain welcomes the decisive vote for a British exit. This is a stunning defeat for the City of London, for the bosses and bankers of Europe as a whole as well as for Wall Street and the US imperialist government. The vote to leave is an expression of hostility from the downtrodden and dispossessed not only to the EU but to the smug British ruling establishment, whose devastation of social services and industry has plunged whole sections of the proletariat into penury.

As we wrote in Workers Hammer (no 234, Spring 2016), calling for a leave vote : “Amid the growing chaos besetting the EU, a British exit would deal a real blow to this imperialist-dominated conglomerate, further destabilising it and creating more favourable conditions for working-class struggle across Europe — including against a weakened and discredited Tory government in Britain. But the failure of Labour and the trade union bureaucracy — like the social democrats and trade union misleaders throughout Europe — to mobilise against the EU has instead ceded the oppositional ground to openly anti-immigrant reactionaries and fascists.”

With anti-EU sentiment running high among working people in France, Spain, Italy and Greece, the vote for Brexit will encourage opposition to the EU elsewhere in Europe. The main purpose of the EU is to maximise the profits of the imperialist ruling classes at the expense of the workers, from Germany to Greece, and of the weaker countries of Europe. The exit of British imperialism could sound the death knell for this inherently unstable capitalist club. Down with the EU! For workers revolution to smash capitalist rule! For a Socialist United States of Europe!

The far right and fascist forces — including UKIP in Britain and the National Front in France — are today rejoicing over “their” victory. UKIP blatantly whipped up vile anti-immigrant racism, including with a disgusting poster implying that thousands of dark-skinned refugees were at Britain’s door. But UKIP hardly has a monopoly on racism: Cameron invoked the spectre of migrant camps similar to the Calais “Jungle” in France moving to England in the event of a British exit. And Labour governments have whipped up anti-immigrant racism just like the Tories. We say: No deportations! Full citizenship rights for all who make it to Britain! Down with racist Fortress Europe!

Those who voted for Brexit did so for a variety of reasons. But only the wilfully blind in the workers movement will see the vote for Brexit as simply a boost for UKIP and the Tory right wing. Cameron has resigned, the Conservatives have been bitterly divided, the capitalist rulers of Europe are in shock. The time is ripe for workers struggles to begin to claw back decades of concessions to the bourgeoisie on wages, working conditions and trade union rights by the reformist union bureaucrats. For a start, the multinational and multiethnic workforce of the NHS should tear up the wretched agreement imposed on junior doctors and mobilise to fight for a revitalised and expanded national health service to provide quality care to all totally free at the point of service. At least the junior doctors fought, unlike Len McCluskey and the rest of the pro-capitalist trade union tops who refused even to mobilise their ranks to fight Cameron’s pernicious new anti-union law. What is needed is a fight for a class-struggle leadership of the unions.

In the wake of the EU’s ravaging of Greece, the “left” Brexit camp, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the Socialist Party offered a half-hearted campaign for a leave vote. From their reformist “old Labour” standpoint, the EU is a barrier to achieving their maximum programme: renationalising British industry under a left Labour government. Faced with closures of the steel plants, this ultimately boils down to a protectionist call to “save British jobs”, which fuels anti-foreigner chauvinism and is counterposed to a class-struggle perspective. The morning after the Brexit vote, the SWP’s crowning demand is: Tories out — for a general election.

A year ago, the same outrage and discontent at the base of society that propelled the vote to leave the EU also fuelled the election of Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party, opening the possibility of reforging Labour’s historic links to its working-class base and thus reversing two decades of Blairite schemes to turn Labour into an outright capitalist party. But in campaigning for a remain vote, Corbyn trampled on the interests of the many working people and minorities who looked to him for a change. Crime does not pay: when the results of the referendum came in, Corbyn’s enemies began plotting to remove him from the leadership as soon as possible. It is in the interests of the working class to repulse any and every attempt by Labour’s right wing to regain control of the party.

Today the country is divided — by class, and along regional and national lines. England — outside London — and Wales voted to leave the EU. A majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain, reflecting fears among Catholics that border controls between North and South would be reinstituted. Scotland too voted to remain in the EU, and the SNP has declared that a second referendum on independence is on the agenda. The bourgeois nationalist SNP are committed to maintaining an “independent” Scotland’s membership of the major Western imperialist clubs — the NATO military alliance and the EU. Corbyn’s capitulation to the imperialist EU has deprived working-class opposition to the EU in Scotland (and elsewhere) of a political voice.

The Brexit vote is the second time in the space of a year that the working masses in Europe have voted to repudiate the EU. Last July’s vote in Greece against EU austerity was utterly betrayed by the bourgeois Syriza government, which crawled on its knees before the European banks. The burning question posed is what kind of party does the working class need to represent its interests. The fundamental problems facing the working class cannot be solved within a parliamentary framework. We need a government based on workers councils, which expropriates the capitalist class.

As part of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) we seek to build revolutionary workers parties, in Britain and around the world, rooted in the understanding that only through the mass mobilisation of the working class in struggle can the workers fight for their own interests and act in defence of all the oppressed. Socialist revolutions especially in the economically developed countries of Europe, including Britain, will establish rationally planned economies based on an international division of labour. The overthrow of the capitalist ruling classes and the development of the productive forces under a socialist united states of Europe will open the road to a global socialist society.

"Day Two of posting a Socialist Leader for every day in January - Tito **TITO (1892-1980)**

Bio:

Josip Broz Tito was born on May 7 1892 into a mixed Croat-Slovene family in the small village of Kumrovec in Northern Croatia. During the first world War he was conscripted by the AustroHungarian Empire and Captured by the Russians, he later ecsaped the POW camp following the October Revolution, and would later volunteer to fight for the Bolsheviks, before eventually making his way back to Croatia at the end of the war During his time in Russia he met and married his wife Pelagija Belousova. Following his reurn to Croatia the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established out of the ruins of Austria-Hungary. During this time Tito became an Active member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) and distributed leaflets to fellow workers, for this he was arrested anf fired from several different Jobs, during this time his wife also suffered several miscarages. During the 1920s he continued to be an anctive Communist and was eventually given a prison sentence for this. His wife and son briefly went to live with sympathetic locals in his hove village, but Pelagija latter left Josip and retured to the USSR. Due to the poltical situation in Yugoslavia during the 30s, Tito and several other memebers of the CPY left the country and established offices in Czechoslovakia and Moscow, during this time . In 1936 he was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Commintern in order to recuit volutneers for the Republicans in the Spainsh Civil war, agian due to the anti-Communist laws in Yugoslavia he had to recuit most members from the Diaspora in France. Tito became head of the CPY in the late 1930s. Following the Fascist invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Tito began to lead an effective partisan resistance against the Fascist German and Italian occupyers as well as their collaborationist puppets like the Ustashe, this partisan resitence was one, if not the most, effective in all of Europe, and by the end of the War the Partisans had vertually Liberated all of Yugoslavia with only minimal help from the British ans Red Army (both of whom provided material to the reisitance Fighters. Following the end of the war a provisional government and state - the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was set up, Tito's party soon won elections that were held and the Monarchists lost all support from the people. Tito was incredably popular at this time as he was seen as the 'Liberator of Yugoslavia.' this state was soon succeded by the  Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia with Tito as it's leader, during this time he also took the honouriffic title 'Marshal of Yugoslavia'. The late 1940s-early 1950s saw a deteriation in relations between Tito and Stalin which eventually led to the Tito-Stalin Split, During this time Yugoslavia became a chamipion of the Non-Aligned Movement, with Tito being the Chair of the movement between 1961-64. Tito continued to rule Yugoslavia and develope a unique form of market Socialim which differed from neibouring Warsaw Pact state's planned economies. Tito died on May 4 1980 and was given a state funeral which was attended by numous digitaries.

"Just because the main character in a sitcom is a fat, stupid guy doesn't mean comedy is oppressing men I've seen this nonsense repeated a lot by MRA types. They insist that because most sitcoms are about a family where the mother is always the smart one & the father is always the dumb one that that is someone oppressive of men.

What they fail to realise (or it's just an act) is that there is a comedy dynamic as old as time where one character is ""the funny man"" & the other character is ""the straight man"". In family-based sitcoms the mother is almost always ""the straight man"" & they are usually a conventionally attractive Mary Sue to boot. They usually only get that stupid smart alecky type of humour (same as the kids).  
Conversely, being stupid is funny, hence why the funny man is often just a moron.

The funny man gets all the laughs. People tune in to see the funny man. The funny man is typically the main character. So if anything, this dynamic, which is always passed off by MRAs as prejudicial against men is actually just another example of sexism in media (not in individual instances, necessarily, but because a trend can be observed).

(Plus, the MRA argument is cherry picking, since there is a large variety of male characters on TV & film, who vastly outnumber female characters, meaning male representation has got the quality, as well as the quantity)",Liberal

"What's your take and what is Bernie's take on the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)? My politics comes from a place of anti-authoritarianism and a deep distrust of centralized power. That's why I like democratic socialism/social democracy because it advocates for decentralizing power as much as feasibly possible.

The CCP, is a highly centralized powerful institution within China, and I think it's pretty hard to deny it is very authoritarian and not even close to communist (not that I'm a communist, just saying that the CCP is very much not). As such I am very opposed to many of the policies and actions of the CCP, such as the genocide of the Uyghurs, the occupation of Tibet, the crackdown in Hong Kong, restrictions of civil liberties at home and support for dictatorships abroad (see North Korea). It's authoritarianism is spreading, whether we like that or not and we need to have a coherent policy around the CCP.

&#x200B;

Like how do you think that the US should respond if Taiwan were invaded?

What should america do in response to civil liberty crackdowns in Hong Kong?

Overall, what should america's policy towards the CCP be?

Please note:

I explicitly referred to the institution I have a problem with: the CCP. I think that some of the talk around China, especially during Covid times, helped cause a spike in hate crimes against Asians that we saw in 2020. I don't intend to be a part of that. So I am naming a specific institution within China that I have an issue with: NOT chinese people/culture or anything like that. The issue is an authoritarian governmental institution, not chinese people. I want to make that clear, and I'd ask that when replying in comments, be clear about the issue, it's the CCP, not China.",Liberal

"The 99 Percent Economy on updating Monetary Socialism for the 21st Century (on Paul Adler's work) [The 99 Percent Economy
How Democratic Socialism Can Overcome the Crises of Capitalism by Paul S. Adler](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_99_Percent_Economy/ZjGoDwAAQBAJ)

In the work above, Paul Adler makes the case for a monetary form of socialism in the 21st century.  Relevant excerpts are below:

> We should expect enormous opposition to this socialization of property from the current private owners. To compensate the current owners—including all working people whose savings had been tied up in stocks, bonds, and land—**the government will issue long- term annuities.**

[...]

> This ring will include some entire industries, **such as banking and finance**, telecommunications, public transportation, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, energy, automobile, steel, aluminum, and the defense industrial base.

[...]

> And any external financing of these [smaller private] enterprises will come from banks, which, being now publicly owned, will use our democratically determined strategic criteria to **make credit-allocation decisions**.

[...]

> We will encourage these [publicly-owned] enterprises to compete on quality and service by **setting a common price for their services**. (If we allowed competition on price, we would be creating a powerful incentive to squeeze labor, and that would be contrary to our goals.)

[...]

> Financial incentives are a second tool. **We will offer workers a collective bonus** that rewards them if their enterprise achieves high output but also penalizes them if their output is either below or above the target. This will help ensure that the economic councils are receiving good information from the enterprises about their capabilities.

[...]

> The consumer banks will operate like savings and loans associations, **paying interest on savings and charging interest on consumer loans**.

All this is in accordance with an outline of a monetary form of socialism provided in *The Social Revolution* by Karl Kautsky, *when he was a Marxist*:

https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1902/socrev/pt2-1.htm

> I speak here of the wages of labor. What, it will be said, will there be wages in the new society? Shall we not have abolished wage labor and money? How then can one speak of the wages of labor? These objections would be sound if the social revolution proposed to immediately abolish money. I maintain that this would be impossible. Money is the simplest means known up to the present time which makes it possible in as complicated a mechanism as that of the modern productive process, with its tremendous far-reaching division of labor, to secure the circulation of products and their distribution to the individual members of society. It is the means which makes it possible for each one to satisfy his necessities according to his individual inclination (to be sure within the bounds of his economic power). As a means to such circulation money will be found indispensable until something better is discovered.",Liberal

"Day #5 of me posting a Socialist Leader for every day of January - Honecker **ERICH HONECHER (1912-1994)**

Erich Honecker was born in the Saarland on in 1912, the son of a coal miner, Honecker was exposed to politics from a young age and was active in the Sparticus League. during the 1920s he joined youth wing of the KPD. during the late 1920s he went to study in the Soviet Union. following his return to Germany in 1930, he formally joined the KPD. he became an active communist in the Saar region (which was autonous and not controlled directly by Berlin) and campaigned against it's reunifocation with (by then Nazi controlled) Germany during the 1935 plebisite, despite his and others efforts the region voted to join the Nazis. Honecker was arrested by the Fascists in 1935 after secretly traveling to Berlin to organise with the underground KPD and distribute anti-Nazi propaganda in the city. He would remain in prison for most of the 30s and forties despite attempting to escape several times. He was liberated by the Red Army in 1945.  Following the end of the war he became a memeber of the newly formed SED party and the head of it's Youth wing. Honecher soon became closely alinged with the party leader (Walter Ulbricht) and a prominent menber of the party. in 1958 he became a member of the Politbureu and was one of the overseers of the construction of the Birlin wall. Honecker would become the Leader of the SED in 1971 and would lead the party and the German Democratic Republic as it's head of state, until the disateous year of 1989, during the 80s friction grew in the SED and beteen the USSR and GDR as Honecker was critical of Peristroika and Glastnose and refused to implement similar actions in the GDR.

Following the collapse of the GDR, honecker, who was in poor health was put on trial by the West for alleged crimes during his tenure as head of the GDR - primarly about the shooting of defectors who had tried to cross the Birlin wall. as the trials dragged on Honecker attemted to claim Assilum in the USSR (which Gorbachov refused) and later Chile (The GDR had taken many refugees following the coup of 1973) Honecker's health continued to decline durng the trial and he was eventually released in 1992, after this he traveled into exile in Chile (his wife had areadly been granted assilum there) where he died in 1994.

"Trump, Russian trolls, and the Arizona “fraudit” All over Reddit, paid Russian government disinformation trolls are defending the fraudulent Arizona recount. Often, their defense is subtle — “let it play out”, “Trump lost and can’t be reinstated, so what’s the harm?”, “if you didn’t commit fraud, why are you afraid of the recount?”, “how is it fraudulent?” And we know that Putin’s piglet (what the Russian media calls Trump) sees this “fraudit” as his last hope. The fact that Russian trolls are so ardently defending it shows that Putin, too, sees it as his last chance to get Trump back in or, at the very least, to cause widespread violent unrest in the country.

Please write to your Congressman and Senators expressing your concern and urging them to press the DOJ to take action. If the Trumpist/QAnon firm conducting the bogus Arizona “audit” succeeds in altering enough ballots to falsely claim Trump won Maricopa County, Republicans all over the country will force the same procedure in every state Biden flipped and very well might take to the streets with even more violence than on January 6. This farce needs to be stopped now!

Just to recap about the “recount”:

1. ⁠AZ elections officials, including Republicans, conducted several recounts and found no discrepancies. They certified the vote as accurate. So, this is just grandstanding and a political power-play. 

2. ⁠The company Cyber Ninjas doing this farcical recount has no experience in such a thing, were hired by partisan Republicans, and are headed by a man who is a declared Trumpist and a Q anon adherent.

3. ⁠There is no oversight

4. ⁠It is illegal for non elections officials to handle sealed ballots

When this first started, those doing the recount had blue pens with them, which are totally illegal to have near a ballot as they can be used to alter a ballot. A judge had to stop that, but it was not until time had elapsed.",Liberal

This week, our 1st shift supervisor found out that his fiance, who has been battling lung cancer for a year and a half, is being taken off of treatment and was given a few weeks to live. They have 4 children together, three of which live at home. The boss and I immediately started filling out paperwork to get him his vacation time and money so he could be home with his family and then our company informed us that they were not going to give him his vacation time or pay until his anniversary date which is in July. 

He has been with the company for eight years and has never caused any problems or even been written up for anything. He always comes in for OT no matter the weather conditions or how last minute the OT is needed.... and then he gets treated like this. The only ""help"" the company offered was 12 weeks of FMLA all unpaid. When we spoke to the bosses, their first response was ""Well if we give him time off, will he be coming back to work?"" That's who we are working for. 

The woman that this man loves is soon going to be just a memory and he will have their three grieving children to look after and these tools want to know if he is coming back to work.

"A couple questions about education availability in america and a more general discussion I had with my right libertarian dad about inequality and poverty in America. Hello,

So again, I recently had a discussion about poverty in America with my right libertarian dad. He tends to think education is the best way forwards and that because of grants and scholarships, that education is equally available to all. And, to him, the inequality seen today is justified because people make poor decisions and get, to quote the man ""stupid degrees like French literature instead of degrees they get jobs like STEM"" and be argues that they therefore end up in debt. It is the old personal responsibility mantra, and that people are poor because they ""choose to"" through bad choices.

So I have a number of issues with this, notably that your parents income is a far better predictor of your future income thanks to stuff like opportunity hoarding, something to fall back on, network advantages (it's easier to find a rich investor if your dad knows a lot of rich investors), etc. There is also some evidence that rich high school dropouts stay rich in the same proportion that poor college graduates do. Plus, rich kids get ""stupid"" degrees all the time, I've personally seen it. Poor families tend to prioritize STEM, there's a reason that there is a joke in a lot of originally poorer immigrant families (based on what I have heard from friends anyways) that ""you will be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer, and nothing else!""
I tend to see that sentiment expressed in poorer families more than rich ones. But that's anecdotal, idk if there is data to back that up.

But idk if his specific claims about education availability or ""stupid"" degrees is accurate. Is it? Why don't scholarships (which they are a lot of, I did just recently have to apply and my brother currently is) prevent the massive student debt crisis we see? My dad thinks it is because people are lazy and don't apply enough. Is that true or is there a better explanation?",Liberal

"Is anyone else just deeply angry with the state of things? Hi,

I'm a 20 year old american man. Looking at the state of shit right now I am just fucking furious (sorry this is gonna be a bit of a rant).

Yesterday, Russia, a massive country with a huge fucking military, invaded relatively tiny Ukraine for the great ""sin"" of existence. Civilians have been killed, and Ukraine will probably fall to Russian forces, most likely seeing a new pro-russian government installed in Kiev.

Not too long ago, the Afghan government fell to the Taliban. Once again, women are forced into subjugation, brutal punishments, all for the ""sin"" of reading and educating themselves. They must once again wear veils regardless of their consent. Musicians have had their instruments destroyed, innocent people beaten in the streets all in the name of a hard right fascist ideology that attempts to ""justify"" itself by slandering other muslims around the world. And of course, the Taliban endorsing child brides. Meanwhile, Taliban leaders send their own daughters to schools abroad. Rules for thee but not for me...

But hell, even the Afghan government the US installed was deeply corrupt and problematic. It spent 20 years effectively robbing the Afghan people. There was an acronym used to describe the government in Afghanistan: VICE (Vertically Integrated Criminal Organization). It ran protection rackets, took bribes, regularly ""lost money"" due to corruption, etc. Hell, I remember reading in some leaked US military papers that Taliban checkpoints were more popular than that national government's because when you had to pay a bribe to the Taliban to cross, they gave you a ticket so other Taliban checkpoints would know you paid, whereas the national government didn't. The corruption of the Afghan government was extreme, and I am not surprised it fell so quickly as it was basically only propped up by the Americans. If I remember correctly, they reported having several thousand more troops than they actually had. And troops themselves were deeply under equipped. Like they literally had to buy coats for themselves level under equipped. Why? Because higher ups sold off material meant for troops on the black market. And now that America has left, the Taliban has taken over. From one deeply corrupt and basically criminal government, to an all out authoritarian fascist regime. How fucking tragic.

That's not even to mention what amounts to an illegal invasion of Iraq on the part of the US thanks to the lies of the Bush administration.

Or the collapse of the resistance to Assad

Or Europe's response to the Syrian Refugee crisis

Or American support of the war in Yemen

Or Russian support of Assad and Lukashenko

Or American abandonment of the Kurds under Trump

At home, Nazis march in the streets and praise the Taliban and Russia for their brutal and aggressive actions. Trans people face increasing discrimination and crackdowns, book burnings take place in the name of ""free speech"". Fears of authoritarianism in America are on the rise as the right actively embraces and praises authoritarian leaders and practices. White Christian Nationalism has come to dominate the right in america and any who don't fit that mold are fucked. Increases in hate crimes against trans people, jewish people, asian americans, etc all took place. Meanwhile, we block refugees from countries where we fucking created the problem (Afghanistan) because, as Fucker Carlson put it, ""First we invade, and then we are invaded"", just gotta add on a little Great Replacement Theory on top of that don't you? On top of that, we have increased voter suppression, increased violence from right wing domestic terror groups (who does it target I wonder....)

Meanwhile, the democrats are too scared to do anything substantial. I mean hell, what happened to student loan cancellation that would definitely help dems win in 2022? What big changes have we got that will alter the election landscape for the democrats? I mean honestly, what hope do we have in 2022. Right now we have all of Congress and the Presidency. If shit doesn't get done before the midterms the Republicans will probably retake the Senate if not the House, and then they will continue enacting voter restriction on the state level as the federal government is unable to do anything thanks to partisan gridlock, and then we have another green bay sweep:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RykP-UkJ86k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RykP-UkJ86k), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaIuv5uG7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaIuv5uG7Y). And all because what? People are mad that they can't be racist assholes anymore? So we have to give up fucking DEMOCRACY?

I am genuinely pissed and scared. I once thought a dictator would never come to power in America. To be honest, I am starting to believe it is basically inevitable. At this point, I am kinda expecting America to turn into an illiberal democracy a la Hungary, some proto-fascist state.

Around the world, democracies are falling and autocracy and fascism are on the rise. And I am sitting here watching it happen.

I just so fucking angry and I don't feel like I have an outlet for it. I protested some, but it doesn't feel like enough, or it's not doing anything. Don't get me wrong, it felt good to shout down fascist scum, but at the same time it doesn't feel like enough. Idk man, what do i do with this anger? How do I personally fight these trends? Anyone else feel this way?",Liberal

"Just starting The Second Sex and I have some questions In her intro to the book, Judith Thurman states,

Since she doesn’t cite her sources there, my question to you lovely people is, which differences are generally accepted by the scientific community as innate and not simply produced by social conditioning (to clarify, the differences I consider obvious are anatomical, metabolic, and hormonal ones)? What studies might she be talking about? Links to peer-reviewed articles or references to specific studies I can go find myself would be helpful.


I know the answers to these questions are not black and white and our personhoods are the result of complex interactions between our biology and our environment. I’m not a biological essentialist and at this point I’m very much on Beauvoir’s side that women are made and not born, but I also feel that having a good evidence-based grasp of what is nature and what is nurture is essential not only to understanding the claims of this book but being a good feminist in general.

"Can a society afford Universal Basic Income? This is the fundamental sticking point of the UBI proposal(s). Many people do not believe that a society can afford UBI - that funding this for everyone would lead to everyone being impoverished.

That argument leaves me with a strong distaste - it directly implies that the person believes that it's necessary for people to exist in the margins in order for the rest of us to enjoy a reasonably comfortable life.

But if we dig even further and realize that the 99% of us exist on a mere 2% of the available resource pie, and most of us are able to meet our basic needs, that we could take some of that 98% of resources that we simply never even see, and use that to bring everyone up.

[Per the World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/poverty-rate-by-state), between 7 and 20% of people in the USA live in poverty. That implies that the remaining 92-79% of people are consuming the bulk of that 2% share of the resource pie.

If we increased that share to a mere 3%, that extra 1% alone would ensure that everyone had their basic needs met, and no one lived in poverty any longer.

I've grown to realize that the people who oppose UBI fail to recognize just how much of our resources have been funnelled to the 1%, and we simply never even see those resources in circulation.

There's far more out there than we realize. No one except for the 1% needs to spend a dime to see UBI realized. Nor Universal Health Care, or universal education.

"Any ideas on how I can connect with leftists in the Human Resources field? Now, before you all come at me with a ""impossible, there's no such thing"", just hear me out first (and then you can come at me after that lol)

(Throwaway bc I don't want this attached to my main in case my work ever finds it)

I currently work in HR but I'm practically entry level (and at a tech startup). Which means I don't do any of *those* parts of HR: I don't receive reports of harassment, I don't make decisions regarding salary, I don't handle manager/employee disputes, I don't even find out if an employee's been fired until after the decision's been made.

Now, obviously, this won't always be the case if I stay in HR - eventually I'll get promoted to an HR Manager role where I'd have to take on these types of responsibilities. I always figured that by then I'd just quit my job, and go to grad school to get an MSW or something that won't leech my soul from my body.

That said, after a few conversations with various people, I've started to wonder if maybe there's another palatable option, where I stay in HR, take on responsibilities, but influence the org in subtle ways. I mean, obviously I'd never be able to convince any executive team or board of directors to abandon capitalism and embrace a socialist approach to labor, but maybe I could do things like ""creative statistics"" where our salary benchmarks encourage our lowest-paid jobs to be paid more, or become an advocate for employee voices, that type of thing.

I could be, like, an undercover agent of leftism, lol. Hiding in plain sight in a Human Resources department near you.

Problem is, I'm totally lost on how to do this. There are plenty of professional associations that could like me with a mentor in the field, but they almost certainly wouldn't have the right ideological standpoint. I know how these people tend to think.

If this whole idea turns out not to be viable, I'll likely just cut my losses and change fields before it's too late (I mean, yeah, technically I still wouldn't be a capitalist since I wouldn't own any means of production, but still, doesn't mean it would sit right with me to be the capitalist's lackey/dancing monkey/sheriff/etc. The ACAB part of me is too wigged out by the thought). But if it's possible, I'd love to take a stab at it. But I need an advisor, you know?

Anyway, if anyone has any recommendations on how to find my Yoda, please let me know. And if you've read all this way and still think it's a ridiculous question and no such person exists, go ahead and call me out - you've earned it lmao.",Liberal

"Does anyone else feel like the discussion of which system is best gets frequently conflated with technology and people? Preface: Im not making an argument more of an obersation that i would like some input on.

Let me explain. Any system will fail horribly if the people are inadequate to maintain it, for whatever reason. At the same time, any system can ""work"" with the right people. For example, a benevolent monarch or dictator over ""pure democracy"". Or capitalism if (i know how this sounds) every capitalist had more human compassion than greed. 

So, along with the quality of people, technology matters. As technology increases, life becomes overall easier regardless of system. For example getting from a to b, getting treated medically, finding information, communicating, getting a resource, etc.

Bearing these two points in mind, technology and people, how much bearing does the type of goverment really have? I agree it matters a lot. The question is how much? 

Some examples i see where this conflation occurs. Phrases like ""capitalists are evil."" (So are non-capitalists). Or ""socialism will distribute resources better."" Depends on the people in charge. 

Also in historical examples. For example USSR getting credit for industrialization. But wait....industrialization would have occured either way (we may assume.) Same in China. China is a historical civilization that would have industrialized either way. I assume if ""communism"" never existed, China would still have done most of what they did (build factories, high speed rail, military, etc.) Of course same thing in America. Once coal, trains, steel exisyed, industrialization was BOUND to occur. Even under a king or any government IMO. 

In conclusion, i notice people give most or all credit to government type. I believe most of the credit for all accomplishments goes to the people themselves and technological improvement. A government is more a vehicle to accomplish what is desired rather than the actual thing causing it.",Liberal

"Addressing Housing Affordability in Bangladesh I recently read an [article by the Daily Star about affordable housing in Bangladesh](https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/affordable-homes-all-1813060).

Although I support the Daily Star's mission to provide more housing to our fellow countrymen, I disagree with some of their proposed policies. Some of the policies I AGREE with include -

 \- Developing cities and towns outside of Dhaka

 \- Decentralising the housing market via better public transport and rail network.

 \- Reducing registration and construction costs

 \- Digitisation of land rights

 \- Financial support for the homeless

However,   I disagree with providing tax incentives/subsidies and cheaper mortgages to homeowners. I have lived in Australia for more than 5 years and this is the strategy that was employed by the governments of the last few decades. Although this temporarily increases the homeownership rate, it makes housing increasingly unaffordable since you're increasing the demand without addressing the supply issue. The strategy has cost the government a lot of money and has actively resulted in a housing crisis across the country. This [video ](https://youtu.be/zBQkYlMOiAc)by Australia's public broadcaster illustrates this problem very well.

The video also mentions a policy that was enacted by Robert Menzies,   Australia's Prime Minister in the 50s, which was actually more successful. This wasn't focused on providing cheaper loans to first-time homeowners, but instead, the government building a lot of housing and then selling them at a low cost. This resulted in the highest ownership rate (i.e. 70%) in Australia, which has never been replicated by the succeeding administrations.

Here are some of my proposals for addressing the housing problem in Bangladesh -

 \-   Tax incentives/subsidies and cheaper loans to property developers to   incentivise them to increase the housing stock in the country

 \- Land value taxes, in order to prevent land hoarding and incentivise the efficient use of land

 \- Vacancy taxes, to punish people who hoard housing and don't rent it out to people.

"The Understanding of Social Democracy in the US Hi! I'm a guy from Norway. Lately I've been reading - and watching some youtube videoes - about the corona pass situation and I've tried to take in all the different perspectives, from ""Goverment knows best"" to ""This is robbing my personal freedom"". What I've noticed in my online research (on forums, comments, videoes etc) is that SOME Americans have a really warped understanding of what a social democracy actually is. I've come across people that seriously believe we have to stand in bread lines to get breakfast every day in Scandinavia. And I've seen several people compare a social democracy to the society in George Orwell's 1984, which is very strange IMO cause George Orwell was himself a socialist and the book is not a warning about socialism, but about totalitarianism.   


Anyway, this has made me interested in hearing from American people that believes in Social Democracy. How do you feel that the general understanding of a social democracy is in the US? Do you feel that you face many misconceptions among people when it comes to this subject? Or is it just something that exists on the far-right side of the population?",Liberal

"How would a heavy tax on billionaires be implemented if the richest billionaires make the majority of their wealth off of appreciation in value on their stocks and assets? From what I understand, most billionaires make increase their net worth in stocks and assets rather than traditional income. They pay low income tax because their actual salary is usually pretty low compared to their money from stocks and assets. Most of their money spent comes from borrowing from their assets. This in mind, how would a tax on billionaires be implemented, since they are *technically* allowed to be doing what they’re doing right now.",Liberal

"Capitalism and the Enviroment Hi! I am from Norway and I have never voted for the Social Democrats, always went with the Socialist party because I feel they have more empathic attitudes towards people, animals and the enviroment as a whole, while the Social Democrats just wanna keep pumping oil out of the ground.   


As with many people, my votes were usually based more on individual cases though, and not really considering a whole different economical structure than capitalism. I think socialism often means different things to people that are very into politics and people that are not. For instance, it's not so long ago I heard some teenagers talk on the bus that they were voting on the socialistic party because they wanted legalized weed. Doubt they ever considered socialism as something opposed to capitalism, you know. Motives vary. I never really saw myself as a very political person either, and voting for the socialistic party was never really about abolishing capitalism, I guess. In my country we have a multi-party system, so it's not like one party could just change everything anyway.   


Lately though, I've been going down the rabbit hole on climate change and how humanity affects the enviroment worldwide. And for me it's really hard to grasp how we can live in harmony with our planet while sticking to capitalism. I've read about green capitalism and all that shit, but I feel like I really have to stick my head in the sand to believe that capitalism will not mess up the earth beyond repair, no matter how green we prentend it is. Capitalism is a system that demands infinite growth on a planet with limited resources!  Infinte growth, limited resources - How on earth is that gonna work!?   


I've seen som many defenders of capitalism claim that socialism will eventually lead to disaster, but capitalism is already leading to disaster. Hell, it already did! It chops down rain forests and fills the oceans with garbage. I'd love to find an excuse for capitalism, to find info about some kinda regulated eco-friendly capitalism that could actually be sustainable, but it kinda feels like trying to convince myself that Santa Clause is real at this point.   


So I'd like to hear your opinions on capitalism and the enviroment. Is there a way? How can we do this?Cause I think humanity has a lot of growing up to do before we could make pure socialism really work. It's just hard to see another way that will not completely fuck the earth out of it's resources.",Liberal

"Losing respect for the SPD, once again The german red left have a massive problem regarding Russia. The SPD have always been close to Russia, having played a major role in the construction of NordStream 2 and several similar projects. Social Democratic Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has once called Putin ""a flawless democrat"". The LINKE are even more Russia-phile, they actually support abandoning NATO, instead forming a new defensive alliance including Russia. Now, these are all widely known facts, and have been for a while. The left are not alone with this problem, the Christian Democrats have similarly strong ties to Russia, and the AfD are - like they usually are - even worse than all the other parties in this regard.

This issue has once again become apparent with the SPD rejecting weapon exports to Ukraine.
Sure, i could try and defend the SPD, saying that this issue is far less black-and-white than it seems. Many of the decisions regarding weapon exports to Ukraine have been met under the old government, and there are arguments against Germany sending weapons to Ukraine (for example based on Germany's more diplomatic approach to dealing with Russia, as well some of the regulations regarding weapons exports from Germany). I myself am kind of split on weapons exports to Ukraine, though now tending towards them. Olaf Scholz is saying he will heavily restrict trade with Russia if an invasion should happen, but frankly, i don't believe he would actually do so. This issue goes far beyond the current crisis. The SPD are far too close to Russia, and try to criticise them as little as possible.
I have never particularly liked Olaf Scholz, and the little confidence i had had in him is on the verge of vanishing. I am sure that this government will do a lot better than the previous one, but with the SPD acting like this, many structural issues can not be fixed.
It seems that whenever i have gained some respect for the SPD, they do
something like this, abandon all the values they have defended for over 150 years, and remind me again of why i support the Greens instead of them. The SPD are undoubtedly the party that have had more positive influence on Germany than any other. However there are things that I am sick of defending. The SPD are responsible for their poor performance in recent years, and this is one of the reason for it.

What is your opinion on the german red lefts connections to Russia? Is it defensible to hold such a stance on Russia? Also, are there social democratic parties in your country that have similar connections to Russia, or other ""questionable"" countries?",Liberal

"WikiLeaks reveals DNC holds labor unions in contempt (x-post /r/Leftwinger) The latest WikiLeaks document dump — containing emails by high-ranking staffers of the Democratic National Committee — caused considerable heartburn for America’s oldest political party. But what’s just as interesting is the dog that didn’t bark — the fact that wasn’t regarded as a scandal but perhaps ought to have been.

Even casual political observers can see that labor union leadership and the Democratic Party are allied. AFL-CIO boss Richard Trumka spoke at the convention the other night, endorsing Hillary Clinton and calling the Republican nominee “wrong, wrong, wrong” for America.

Yet the emails that have been released highlight the rather one-way relationship between the Democratic Party and labor unions. DNC staffers see the unions as good soldiers in skirmishes with Republicans, as a pain when it comes to getting things done and, ultimately, as pushovers.

When brainstorming what to do about last week’s Republican National Convention, the DNC’s Rachel Palermo urged her party to “meet with the hotel trades, SEIU, and Fight for 15 about staging a strike.” She said the result could be a “fast food worker strike around the city or just at franchises around the convention.” The aim would not be to improve working conditions, but to bloody Republicans.

Alternately, the DNC could “infiltrate friendly union hotels and properties around the convention that Republicans will be patronizing to distribute ‘care’ packages” — probably not chocolates.

Palermo also noted that “SEIU has space in downtown Cleveland close to convention that can be the base of operations and host the wrapped mobile RV.”

The union-DNC alliance does impose a few constraints on the DNC, which staffers both mocked and worked to circumvent. DNC staffer Katja Greeson, for instance, complained about delays involved in getting new business cards printed.

She explained to an irked communications director that sending work to union shops caused delays. “Believe me — it is equally frustrating to us,” she said. Greeson also threatened “if they can’t deliver,” DNC staffers would “go to FedEx Kinkos” and do it themselves.

The DNC pledges to use only unionized hotels. But it turns out there’s a workaround for that, too. Trey Kovacs, who has done yeoman’s work spelunking through the DNC WikiLeaks dump, uncovered this one. In an exchange over whether they could use the non-union Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., a DNC staffer says they could just get a “waiver” to use it.

“It is unclear from the emails how or what circumstances must arise to obtain a waiver, but it seems that convenience for the chairman trumps loyalty to adhering to some kind of internal guidelines of exclusively patronizing unionized establishments,” Kovacs, a policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told me Wednesday.

Because this document dump has emails both to and from the DNC, we also hear from the unions themselves, which might explain why the party can count on their support come-what-may.

For instance, Sandra Lyon of the American Federation of Teachers asked for any “regular talking points” the DNC might have to pass on to AFT folks who speak with the media.

And the National Education Organization’s political communications director Michael Misterek wrote longingly to the DNC in May, “I’m hoping we can sit down to meet some time soon, over coffee or a cocktail. I’d love to figure out how we can work together and be most helpful to each other these next few months.”

"Importance of Civil Liberties For  a communist party operating within a bourgeois state, the defence of  civil liberties (or democratic rights) is important, not just because  civil liberties make people's lives more pleasant in the short term, but  because civil liberties facilitate the work of the communist party: it  can publish and distribute its press, recruit openly, be less fearful of  imprisonment, hold meetings openly, etc. if there is a high or  moderately high degree of civil liberty in that bourgeois state. If the  communist party's work is easier, then presumably revolution, the  objective of the communist party, becomes more likely. Thus civil  liberties are important to revolution.

I  am looking for support within the Marxist canon -- preferably by Marx,  Engels, or Lenin, but also by other Marxists -- for the above  proposition that civil liberty within the bourgeois state is important.

For  example, Karl Marx, in \*Class Struggles in France,\* Part II, says that  the constitution of the bourgeois democratic republic sanctions the  social power of the bourgeoisie while withdrawing the political  guarantees of this power, forcing it ""into democratic conditions, \*which  at every moment help the hostile forces to victory and jeopardise the  very foundations of bourgeois society.\*""

I am hoping to find other textual support of this kind.  Any references would be appreciated.

I  should probably note that my purpose here is not to get you to give me  free help with a school essay or something. I am looking for material to  try to convince some members of the communist party I belong to to take  the struggle for democratic rights more seriously.",Liberal

"""Black Box"" Topics (Ideological Oppression) (Narrated version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVmn4CgKP9w))

As a Midwesterner, I’ve had my entire life to observe the traits of a culture that spans across the lowly populated areas of America and there are a few things that, to me, stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, one of the biggest just so happens to be our avoidance of what I like to call “black box” topics. This includes sexuality, money, religion, and politics. It’s frankly a very lazy way of going about difficult discourse. 

So, to back up a bit, Midwestern social culture is a lot about keeping to yourself. Not bothering someone over the little things and not getting into anyone’s business. This doesn’t keep your occasional American from being visually and audibly loud and obnoxious, but even then, the chances that someone is going to call you out for that kind of thing are minimal. The Midwest's “keep to yourself” culture oozes its way into social interactions, and like jazz, is less about what you do, and more about what you don't do.

So what’s the big hubbub about these “black box” topics? Why are they so important, and why does the Midwestern social culture hammer into our minds that such things should be avoided? I’d argue that these four topics, in one way or another, are connected to traditional ideals that are uncomfortable to question. Sexuality can be under the umbrella of such things as contraceptives, abortion, or LGBT topics. As for money, one might get too close to questioning capitalism if such discussions were followed to their conclusions. Politics as many stubborn people hold views that follow tradition or the general politics of their parents and the state they live in. And religion? I doubt that one needs explaining.

Disallowing the discussion of these important topics is a factor of control. If sexuality isn’t discussed, then your school has complete power over whether you get “abstinence only” schooling, or a real sexual education. If discussions about money are suppressed, it’s much harder for people to sympathize with the struggles of lower-income citizens, and can make it harder for employees under the same employer to realize they’re not being paid fairly across the board. If religion isn’t discussed, people won’t realize that there are other options than just abrahamic religions, and that some terrible people hide behind the bible to mask being bigoted. If political discussion is silenced, then we will never learn how to maturely discuss pressing issues and we stay very ignorant of basic historical facts.

This is all just the tip of the iceberg, but my general point is you can’t ban anything. Banning drugs leads to misuse, banning abortions leads to many unsafe ones, banning firearms can lead to people buying them off of the black market, but most importantly: banning certain kinds of discussions leads to a mentally numbed populace. For the rest of this essay, I’m going to elaborate on how specifically these four “black box topics” can harm us when we avoid discussion of them.

Firstly, and this will be a quick one, religion. As I said before, an open discussion about this topic would make it a lot harder for cowardly bigots to hide behind religious ideology as their reasoning for discrimination. One could just simply admit to being bigoted, but instead they try to look for something to hide behind so the blame would instead fall upon the institution of religion instead of themselves as an individual. Additionally, more open discussion about religion would break the cycle of indoctrination that is the passing down of the same religion from generation to generation in a family. The problem I have with this is that young people of a society don’t have the capacity to understand religion, and instead usually believe in it to impress their parents or gain brownie points with the community, but secondly, religion should be chosen based on unbiased theological study. One should learn about every belief system there is to be offered, and pick one from there. Not only does this save someone the hardship of having to leave a religion later in life which devastates their clergy, but it gives one insight on other religions and forms a sense of oneness with other beliefs, making it harder to discriminate against the others.

Getting to sexuality, this seems to be a topic that more parts of the US ignore than just Midwesterners. There are plentiful downsides to avoiding discussions about sexuality. [Of course, one of the biggest being the increase in teen pregnancies when a school decides to teach “abstinence only” instead of legitimate sexual education](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/08/23/545289168/abstinence-education-is-ineffective-and-unethical-report-argues). People are going to have sex before marriage, might as well teach them how to use contraceptives before they upset conservatives again when they have to get an abortion. Teen pregnancies and contraceptives aren’t the only important facets of the discussion on sexuality. Whether or not we teach LGBTQ+ topics in classes about sexuality and sexual health has been a political topic for some time. On one hand you have the right whining that this will indoctrinate their kids, but on the other hand, I see this kind of education being extremely important. Not being taught about homosexuality doesn’t keep someone from being homosexual, it just keeps them from understanding how they feel, romantically and sexually, later on in life. Different identities should be taught in school sexuality classes, and myths should be debunked there too. America was once in a time where we thought AIDs was spread by simply touching someone and that homosexuals had literally thousands of sexual partners. Lastly, it’s my belief that both sexes should be taught about both reproductive systems. It’s pathetic that so many men don’t know what PMS is or don’t know how period hygiene products work.

Now on to money. This one seems to be pretty common to avoid too. Partially because being open about or flaunting one’s socioeconomic status is looked down upon. It is both shameful and embarrassing to be openly poor, but also kinda douchey to be openly rich. As I described earlier, keeping quiet the discussions about money can [make it easier for an employer to pay people unfairly giving the employer a higher ground in pay negotiations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xH7eGFuSYI). As for outside the workplace, a lack of discussion about money can keep many well-to-do people or middle class people from being sympathetic to those of other incomes and financial situations. For instance, when I was still in high school, I was talking with a kid in my class who had a father that had a well-paying job. The discussion got into how California is expensive and about poverty in general. This kid, we will call him Kevin for the sake of this essay, told me that the poor have nothing to worry about. That they can move easily, especially if they get an employer that will pay for them to move like his dad’s did. Of course, I knew this was a bunch of bullshit; one of my boyfriends had to move to my home state because it was cheaper than California and there’s no way that his mother would have gotten a job here that would pay for her to move, that’s rare. The problem here is that Kevin assumed that everyone else, including the poor, had the same opportunities that his dad did. This is called “egocentrism”, and it can lead a lot of middle to upper class people to believe that the reason the poor are poor isn’t due to lack of opportunity, but instead laziness or foolishness. Hate is ignorance, and just as racism is a result of ignorance, so too is hate of the poor. This is why conversations about money are so important, and need to stop being taboo.

Lastly, politics. Setting aside my own biases, there is so much that could be gained from more conversations on politics. The way I see it, there are a lot of people who don't research a topic or don’t have any nuance that still think their opinions are factual. Obviously, I’m not going to give an opinion on an academic or political subject unless I research it, because otherwise, I’d be spreading harmful misinformation. There are so many people that believe basic myths such as: “The Nazis were socialist”, “Stalin/Communism killed 100 million people”, “Antifa is fascist”, “Any radical politics are bad”, etc. Our historical education is painfully basic and leaves out lots of details or [alters them to give you a different mindset of history that more so benefits your country than the truth](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/india-modi-culture/). Biased historical education allows a country to put a lens on someone’s view of the world to keep them from having any thoughts or opinions that might harm existing power structures. It’s never really fully explained why communism is bad in any of the history classes I was in as a kid, but that sure didn’t stop many people from believing it was terrible without second-guessing it. Same for making tons of students believe that our country is the best, or that the ones we went to war with are barbaric, or that our democracy is completely functional. History isn’t objective when there are many people who will interpret it differently. That is why discussion about history and politics is so important. It allows us to challenge our views and expand our knowledge on a subject that is seldom properly taught in American public schooling.

Here’s the takeaway; there is a reason I hate this culture of avoiding “black box” topics, and it’s an ideological power structure. By keeping people ignorant, you can rip them off as an employer, suppress sexual and economic freedom, and get your populace to follow politics that reinforce oppressive power structures. We all need to understand that avoiding a topic is lazy, and we should instead be taught how to have conversations about difficult topics instead of outright avoiding them.",Liberal

"Workers of the World: Labor's Potential to Resist Capital is as Strong as Ever Trade unionists in the 1920s didn’t have much reason for optimism. Labor membership, which had shot upwards amid postwar unrest, crested and then plunged. Observers fretted that technological and cultural changes had rendered the labor movement obsolete and workers apathetic. “Our younger members, especially, have gone jazzy,” one union official lamented in the mid 1920s.

A decade later, strikes were blocking production across the country, and union density was skyrocketing.

After years of malaise in the labor movement, is a similar upsurge possible today?

Renowned labor scholar Beverly Silver thinks so. Chair of the sociology department at Johns Hopkins University, Silver has been a radical advocate for workers her whole life. Her award-winning work, including her pathbreaking Forces of Labor, deals with profound questions of labor, development, social conflict, and war. In a recent interview with Jacobin she explained what labor’s past can tell us about the present state — and future — of working-class struggle around the globe. The last few decades have seen a profound restructuring of the working class in the United States and other advanced capitalist countries. What are the broad contours of that restructuring process, and what are the forces driving it?

Capitalism is constantly transforming the organization of production and the balance of power between labor and capital — restructuring the working class, remaking the working class. So to answer this question I think we need to take a longer-term view.

It makes sense to go back to the mid-twentieth century — to the thirties, forties, and fifties. That’s when we first see the emergence of a very strong mass-production working class in the United States, most paradigmatically in the automobile industry but also in sectors like mining, energy, and transportation, which were central to industrialization and trade.

Pretty much right out of the gate after World War II, capital moved to restructure — reconfiguring the organization of production, the labor process, sources of labor supply, and the geographical location of production. This restructuring was in large part a response to strong labor movements in manufacturing and mining, in logistics and transportation.

An expanded version of David Harvey’s concept of the spatial fix is helpful here for understanding this restructuring. Capital tried to resolve the problem of strong labor movements, and the threat to profitability that labor posed, by implementing a series of “fixes.”

Companies utilized a spatial fix by moving to lower-wage sites. They implemented “technological fixes” — reducing their dependence on workers by accelerating automation. And they have been implementing what we can think of as a “financial fix” — moving capital out of trade and production and into finance and speculation as yet another means of reducing dependence on the established, mass-production working class for profits.

The beginnings of this shift of capital to finance and speculation was already visible in the 1970s, but it exploded after the mid 1990s, following the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act during the Clinton years.

So what looked like a sudden collapse in the power of organized labor in the United States in the eighties and nineties was actually rooted in decades of restructuring on these multiple fronts that began in the mid-twentieth century.

Of course, it is important to point out that there is another side of the coin. These capitalist fixes unmade the established mass-production working class, but they simultaneously made new working classes in the United States and elsewhere. These new working classes are emerging as the protagonists of labor struggles in many parts of the world today. It is no secret that the traditional forms of working-class organization, like trade unions in the United States and social-democratic parties in Europe, are in the midst of a severe crisis. How has capital succeeded in undermining and taming these organized expressions of working-class interest?

If we look back in history at high points of labor militancy, particularly those moments involving left movements tied to socialist and working-class parties, a recurrent set of strategies to undermine the radical potential of these movements is apparent. They can be summed up as restructuring, co-optation, and repression.

So, the kinds of restructuring or fixes I mentioned above — geographical relocation, technological change, financialization — certainly played an important role in weakening these movements. In the meantime, the co-optation of trade unions and working-class parties — their incorporation as junior partners into national hegemonic projects and social compacts — also played an important role. Finally, repression was an important part of the mix all along.

Just taking the United States as an example, in the post–World War II decades we see McCarthyism and the expulsion of left and Communist militants from the trade unions. Then, in the sixties and seventies, strong factory- and community-based movements of black workers — the Black Panther Party, the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) — were brought under control by out-and-out repression.

And today — with the militarization of local police forces and the endless “war on terror” creating a hostile environment for the mobilization of immigrant and black workers — coercion continues to play a major role. One of the big debates today is whether the defining dynamic shaping the global working class is exploitation — workers being squeezed at the point of production — or exclusion — workers being essentially locked out of stable wage labor. What are your thoughts on this debate?

I see them as equally important. Certainly it would be a mistake to write off the continuing importance of struggles against exploitation at the point of production. Indeed, one outcome of the spatial-fix strategy has been to create new working classes and labor-capital contradictions wherever capital goes.

In other words, workers’ resistance to exploitation at the point of production has followed the movement of capital around the globe over the past half-century. Indeed, we are witnessing the latest manifestation of this dynamic with the massive wave of labor unrest now taking place in China.

Once it became clear to corporations that simply moving factories to low-wage sites could not solve the problem of labor control, capital came to rely more heavily on automation and financialization. Automation, while hardly new, has recently been expelling wage workers from production at a rapid clip, increasing the visibility of the exclusionary dynamic. A recent glaring illustration is the news that FoxConn has actually followed through with its threat to introduce a massive number of robots into its factories in China.

Likewise, the movement of surplus capital into finance and speculation is also contributing in a major way to the increasing salience of exclusion. Finance — especially those financial activities that are not adjuncts to trade and production — absorbs relatively little wage labor; more importantly, it derives profits primarily from the regressive redistribution of wealth through speculation, rather than the creation of new wealth. Hence the link made by Occupy between obscene levels of class inequality and financialization.

Automation and financialization are leading to an acceleration in the long-term tendency of capitalism to destroy established livelihoods at a much faster rate than it creates new ones. This was always the predominant tendency of historical capitalism in much of the Global South, where dispossession tended to outpace the absorption of wage labor, and thus where workers increasingly had nothing to sell but their labor power, but little chance of actually selling it.

While this tendency is nothing new, both its acceleration and the fact that its negative effects are being felt in core countries — and not just in the Third World — help explain why the exclusionary dynamic has come to the fore in current debates. To frame the question differently, does it even make sense to think of exclusion and exploitation as separate processes?

Well, Marx certainly didn’t view them as separate phenomena. In the first volume of Capital, he argued that the accumulation of capital went hand in hand with the accumulation of a surplus population — that wealth was being created through exploitation, but at the same time big chunks of the working class were excluded or made superfluous to the needs of capital.

For most of the twentieth century, there was an uneven geographical distribution in terms of where the brunt of exclusionary processes was felt. Indeed, until recently, one of the ways capital maintained legitimacy within core countries was by pushing the weight of the exclusionary processes onto the Third World as well as onto marginalized sections of the working class within the core.

The world working class was divided, with boundaries very much defined by citizenship, race, ethnicity, and gender. Today these boundaries are still quite salient, however. Particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, the weight of exclusionary processes is being felt more heavily in core countries than in the past — with all sorts of political implications. In your work you’ve thought a lot about the power of workers and the working class. You distinguish between different sources of worker power. Can you talk more about that?

Yes, a major distinction is between structural power and associational power. Associational power is the capacity to make gains through trade union and political party organization. Structural power is the power that comes from workers’ strategic location within the process of production — a power that can be, and often has been, exercised in the absence of trade union organization. Why is it useful to make these distinctions?

Well, take structural power, for example. There are two main types of structural power: workplace bargaining power and marketplace bargaining power.

Most of the time, people think about marketplace bargaining power to understand worker power more broadly. If there’s high unemployment, your marketplace bargaining power is low, and vice versa. Workplace bargaining power — the ability to bring interconnected processes of production to a halt through localized work stoppages — is less emphasized, but is perhaps even more important for understanding sources of workers’ power today.

This is because, if you look at long-term historical trends, workers’ power at the point of production is undoubtedly, on balance, increasing. This is surprising to people. But this increased workplace bargaining power is apparent with the spread of just-in-time methods in manufacturing. In contrast to more traditional mass-production methods, no buffers or surpluses are built into the production process.

Thus, with the spread of just-in-time production in the automobile industry, for example, a relatively small number of workers, by simply stopping production in a strategic node — even, say, a windshield-wiper parts supplier — can bring an entire corporation to a standstill. There are plenty of recent examples of this in the automobile industry around the world.

Likewise, workers in logistics — transport and communication — have significant and growing workplace bargaining power tied to the cascading economic impact that stoppages in these sectors would have. Moreover, notwithstanding the almost universal tendency to think of globalization processes as weakening labor, the potential geographical scale of the impacts of these stoppages has increased with globalization. What about associational power? If workers have no unions or labor parties, doesn’t that undermine their structural bargaining power?

Not necessarily. Take the case of China. Autonomous trade unions are illegal, but there have been some major improvements recently in minimum-wage laws, labor laws, and working conditions. These changes have come out of a grassroots upsurge that has taken advantage of workers’ structural power, both in the marketplace and, even more important, in the workplace.

I think we also have to be honest about the ambiguous structural position of trade unions. If they’re too successful and deliver too much to their base, capital becomes extremely hostile and doesn’t want to deal with them and so moves to a more repressive strategy.

Capital will sometimes make deals with trade unions, but only if trade unions agree to play a mediating role, limiting labor militancy and ensuring labor control. But in order to effectively do that, unions have to deliver something to their base, which brings us back to the first problem. Ultimately, the question is: in what kind of situations does this contradictory dynamic between trade unions and capitalists play out to the benefit of workers? What do you think about arguments that struggles are shifting from the point of production to the streets or community?

This brings us back to the earlier question about the relative importance of exploitation and exclusion in shaping the world working class. Looking at the world working class as a whole today, I don’t think it would be accurate to say that struggles are shifting predominantly to the streets, especially if we are talking about struggles that have a serious disruptive impact on business as usual.

Struggles at the point of production continue to be an important component of overall world labor unrest. At the same time, the excluded — the unemployed and those with weak structural power — have no choice but to make their voices heard through direct action in the streets rather than direct action in the workplace.

The coexistence of struggles at the workplace and struggles in the street has been a feature of capitalism historically, as has the coexistence of exploitation and exclusion. Sometimes these two types of struggles proceed without intersecting in solidarity with each other, especially since, historically, the working class has been divided — both within countries and between countries — in the degree to which their experience is primarily shaped by the dynamics of exclusion or the dynamics of exploitation.

But if we think of major successful waves of labor unrest, they combined, in explicit or implicit solidarity, both of these kinds of struggles. Even the Flint factory occupation and subsequent 1936 and ’37 strike wave — a movement that was fundamentally based on leveraging workers’ power at the point of production — was made more potent by simultaneous struggles in the streets of unemployed workers and community solidarity.

Or, if we think of a recent mass movement that was widely seen as taking place almost entirely in the streets — Egypt in 2011 — it was when the Suez Canal workers leveraged their workplace bargaining power with a strike in support of the mass movement in the streets that Mubarak was forced to step down. It is also interesting to note that the April 6 youth movement that initiated the occupation of Tahrir Square was founded in 2008 to support a major strike by industrial workers.

So a fundamental problem for the Left today, which is also not new, is to figure out how to combine workplace bargaining power and the power of the street — to find the nodes of connection between unemployed, excluded, and exploited wage workers. This is almost certainly easier when the excluded and exploited are members of the same households or the same communities.

In the United States, we can see glimmers of these intersections with the 2015 dockworkers’ strike in California in support of Black Lives Matter mobilizations in the streets, and with the way the community and workplace struggles of immigrant workers intersect. In the United States today, it seems like a major focus of labor organizing and activism is on the lowest-wage workers in the service sectors. What do you make of this? Is this where we should be focusing our energies? Or should we be looking at different kinds of workers in different industries and sectors?

It’s not a mistake to place a big emphasis on these workers. If you’re going to raise the conditions of the majority of the population, you have to raise the conditions of these workers.

I think part of the skepticism inherent in this question is that so far this strategy hasn’t been very successful. Again, thinking about workplace bargaining power is useful here. At Walmart, for example, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to hit the retail side. You have to hit the distribution side.

The same goes for fast food. If you hit the distribution side, then you can leverage workplace bargaining power. Otherwise, you are left with a struggle that is confined to the streets. But this also leads us back to the question of how and when workers with strong workplace bargaining power exercise that power in support of broader transformational goals. Along with Giovanni Arrighi, you have argued that the trajectory of the workers’ movements in the United States and other national contexts are profoundly influenced by their relationship to broader movements in global politics, wars, and international conflicts. How have recent geopolitical shifts affected the strength of labor in the United States?

This is a very big and important question. I think a lot of the discussion of labor movements tends to focus on the economic side, but the geopolitical side is equally, if not more, important for understanding the prospects and possibilities for workers and workers’ movements, historically and going forward.

Fifteen years ago, right before September 11, it looked like we were on the verge of a mass upsurge of labor unrest in the United States, with a strong epicenter among immigrant workers. There were a number of major strikes that had been planned or were in progress, and then the dynamic shifted.

The war on terror gave a major boost to coercion and repression in maintaining the status quo, and not just in the workplace, in terms of employer hostility to trade unions, but more broadly, in terms of the impact of the permanent war environment on the prospects for organizing. Coercion and repression seem to be fundamental to capitalism. What’s different today in the relationship between workers, workers’ movements, and geopolitics?

Well, I think to answer this question it is important to place the current permanent war environment within the context of the broader crisis of US world power and hegemonic decline.

And we need to look at the long-term historical relationship between workers’ rights and the reliance of states on the working class to fight wars. Let’s discuss the latter first.

One of the well-known, but not widely discussed, roots of labor strength — or at least the institutionalization of trade unions and the deepening of democratic rights in the United States and in Western Europe, and to some extent globally — was the particular nature of war in the twentieth century, including the industrialization of the means of war and mass conscription.

To fight this type of war, the core powers, the imperial powers, needed the cooperation of the working class, both as soldiers fighting at the front and as workers keeping the factories going. War-making depended on industrial production for everything from armaments to boots. Hence the common wisdom during both world wars was that whoever kept the factories running would win the war.

In this context worker cooperation was key, and the relationship between war-making and civil unrest was unmistakable. The two biggest peaks of world labor unrest in the twentieth century, by far, were the years immediately following World War I and World War II. The troughs of labor unrest were in the midst of the wars themselves.

It’s also no coincidence that the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement was in the aftermath of World War II and the Korean War, and that the height of the Black Power Movement came during and after the Vietnam War.

States sought to secure the cooperation of workers through the mobilization of nationalist and patriotic sentiments, but this was not sustainable without tangible advances in workers’ rights. Thus, expansions of the welfare state went hand in hand with expansions of the warfare state in the twentieth century.

Put differently: working-class nationalism could only trump working-class internationalism if states showed that winning wars meant rising standards of living and expanding rights for workers as both workers and citizens. Do you think this is still the case today, in the context of seemingly permanent warfare?

The nature of war has changed today in many respects. Just like capital reorganized production in response to the strength of labor, so has the state restructured the military to lessen its dependence on workers and citizens to wage war.

The mass movement against the Vietnam War, and the refusal of soldiers at the front in Vietnam to go on fighting, was a turning point, triggering a fundamental restructuring of the organization and nature of war-making.

We see the results of this restructuring today with the end of mass conscription and the increasing automation of warfare. With the growing reliance on drones and other high-tech weaponry, US soldiers are being removed from direct danger — not entirely, but much more than in the past.

This is a different situation than the one that linked workers’ movements and warfare in the twentieth century. The welfare and warfare states have become uncoupled in the twenty-first century. Whether, under these changing conditions, working-class internationalism will trump working-class nationalism is a critical but unresolved question.

I have focused on the United States in this discussion, but the transformation in the nature of war-making has broader impacts. In the mid-twentieth century, many colonial countries were incorporated into the imperial war process as suppliers of both soldiers and materials for the war effort, leading to an analogous strengthening and militancy of the working class.

Today, in country after country in a wide swath of the Global South, you have a situation in which modern US war-making is leading to the wholesale disorganization and destruction of the working class in places where high-tech weaponry is being dropped. The current “migrant crisis,” both its roots and its repercussions, is a deeply disturbing blowback from this new age of war. In previous periods, rising tides of militancy and organization have tended to bring with them new and powerful organizational forms. In the nineteenth century it was the craft union, in the twentieth century it was the industrial union. Are these forms doomed to historical oblivion, and if so, what might replace them?

They’re certainly not doomed to historical oblivion. In the United States, for example, some of the most successful unions today — in terms of recruiting new members and militancy — are the ones that have their roots in the old AFL, in the craft-worker tradition. Some people say elements of that old organizing style are more suitable to the horizontal nature of current workplaces, rather than the industrial unions associated with vertically integrated corporations.

But this doesn’t mean industrial unions are dead, either. The types of successes that were characteristic of the classic CIO unions — the Flint sit-down strike in the engine plant and the strikes beyond that — relied on the strategic bargaining power of workers at the point of production. I think that there are still lessons to be learned from these successes.

Clearly neither of these forms succeeded in touching the fundamental problems of capitalism, however. As I already mentioned, the problem with trade unions is that, to the extent that they are too effective, capital and the state have no interest in working with them and cooperating.

Yet to the extent that they — and this is largely what’s happened — don’t deliver a serious transformation in the life and livelihoods of workers, they lose credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of workers themselves.

I think we constantly see both sides of this contradiction. The trade unions are part of the solution but are not the full solution. One of the ideas that Marx advocated for is imploring trade unions to connect with the unemployed in a single organization. Is that an option in places like the United States?

I think that it’s certainly the ideal — it’s what Marx and Engels were talking about in the Communist Manifesto in terms of the role of communists in the labor movement.

It also brings us back to the questions about the relationship between processes of exploitation and exclusion and about the relationship between struggles at the point of production and struggles in the street.

For trade unions seeking to follow Marx’s directive, it means thinking strategically about the conditions under which workers with stable waged employment can be drawn into and be radicalized by the struggles of the unemployed and precariously employed, and vice versa. What are the prospects for labor revitalization in the United States? Do you expect to see an upsurge in militancy and organization in the near future?

On the one hand, let me say that I do, just on theoretical grounds, expect an upsurge of labor militancy in the United States, and not just in the United States. On an empirical level, since 2008, we have been witnessing an upsurge worldwide in class-based social unrest, which may be seen in retrospect as the beginnings of a longer-term revitalization.

This assessment goes against the prevailing sentiment. It’s interesting to compare the current pessimism to what was being said by experts in the 1920s. At that time, they were looking at the ways in which craft workers were being undermined by the expansion of mass production, and they were claiming that the labor movement was mortally weakened and permanently dead. They were saying that right up until the eve of the mass wave of labor unrest in the mid 1930s.

They didn’t understand that, while it was true that a lot of the craft-worker unions were being undermined, there was a new working class in formation. We see the same thing today — a situation where there is a twentieth-century mass-production working class that’s being undermined, but there is also a new working class in formation, including in manufacturing.

It’s important not to just wipe manufacturing out of the consciousness of what’s happening even in the United States, much less in the world as a whole. Nevertheless, each time new waves of labor unrest erupt, the working class looks fundamentally different, and the strategies and mobilization again are fundamentally different. Who do you think would lead the upsurge this time around?

It’s hard to say. What is clearer are the critical issues facing labor today, and to some extent these point to the mass base and leadership needed for a “next upsurge” that is transformational. We’re in a situation where capital is destroying livelihoods at a much faster pace than it’s creating new ones, so we’re experiencing on a global scale, including in core countries and the United States, an expansion of the surplus population, and particularly what Marx referred to in Capital as the stagnant surplus population: those who are really never going to be incorporated into stable wage labor.

Contingent workers, temporary workers, part-time workers, and the long-term unemployed — this whole group is expanding, leading us down the road to pauperism. Notwithstanding the deep crisis of legitimacy this is creating for capitalism, there’s nothing, no tendency within capitalism itself, to go in a different direction. If we are going to change directions, it’s going to have to come from a mass political movement, rather than something coming out of capital itself.

There are two other important points to consider. One is that capitalist profitability, throughout its history, has depended on the partial externalization of not only the cost of reproduction of labor, but also the cost of reproduction of nature. This externalization is becoming increasingly untenable and unsustainable, but there’s also no inherent tendency within capital to redirect this.

Moreover, since the treatment of nature as a free good was a pillar of the postwar social compact tying mass production to the promise of working-class mass consumption, no simple return to the so-called golden age of Keynesianism and developmentalism is possible.

Second, the historical tendency in capitalism to resolve economic and political crises through expansionist, militaristic policies and war is something we have to take seriously, particularly in the current period of US hegemonic crisis and decline.

Getting control over oil, grabbing resources, fighting over sea lanes in the South China Sea — these struggles have the potential for incredibly horrific outcomes for humanity as a whole. To avoid this, a renewed and updated labor internationalism will have to overcome the visible tendencies toward a resurgent and atavistic labor nationalism.

So a consideration of geopolitics — examining the links between militarism, domestic conflict, and labor movements — is where we need to begin and end any serious analysis. The old question of socialism or barbarism is as relevant today as it has ever been.

In 1922 he won reelection and finally was seated, and won reelection again in 1924 and 1926. During his lifetime he was a leading voice in the reformist wing of the Socialist Party of America, and help develop a strong socialist movement in Milwaukee, which during the 20th century had three socialist mayors.

Workers Vanguard No. 1125 12 January 2018

Mexico: Earthquakes and Capitalist Criminal Negligence

The following article has been translated from Espartaco No. 48 (December 2017), which is published by the Grupo Espartaquista de México, section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist).

Again on September 19, this time at 1:14 p.m., a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico. At the time, the anniversary of the earthquake that devastated Mexico City in 1985 and left an estimated 20,000 dead and 100,000 homeless was being commemorated. It would appear to be calculated cruelty: the new earthquake struck a little over two hours after a national disaster drill took place. Barely 12 days earlier, an even more powerful 8.2 magnitude earthquake had rocked [the states of] Oaxaca and Chiapas.

In Mexico City, scenes from 1985 were replayed. On one hand were the terror and dismay of the population, millions of whom were scarred for life by the 1985 tragedy. On the other hand, thousands of youth and workers voluntarily mobilized to begin rescue work and gather and distribute food and tools. A contingent of Central American immigrants on their way to the U.S. border stopped in Oaxaca to offer help, risking deportation, while the Cuban deformed workers state sent a brigade of doctors, despite its scarcity of resources and the hostility of [Mexican president Enrique] Peña Nieto (a lackey of yanqui imperialism).

Even if the scale of this tragedy was not close to that of 1985, according to official figures the recent earthquakes left 471 people dead, mainly in Mexico City, where 228 died. Eighty-three people died in Oaxaca and 74 in Morelos state. Although the disaster in Mexico City’s exclusive Roma and Condesa neighborhoods dominated the news, poor areas in the south of the capital were practically devastated, as were impoverished towns in Oaxaca, Morelos, Chiapas and Puebla. Hundreds of thousands of Mexico City inhabitants were left without potable water. According to the Secretary of the Interior, 2.3 million people were left homeless in Oaxaca and Chiapas. But it isn’t nature that should be blamed as centrally responsible for the loss of human lives—it’s the capitalist system, which necessarily generates class inequality and subordinates the very lives of the poor to the production of profits.

When the bourgeoisie and its government speak of “natural disasters,” they are simply trying to cover up the criminal negligence and priorities of the capitalist system. Some of the collapsed buildings in the capital were poorly built multifamily residential buildings intended to house workers’ families; other buildings had been opened only a few months before they caved in. In rural and semi-rural areas, many of the homes that collapsed had been built or expanded by workers or peasants on their own, with whatever materials they could afford and with scant structural planning.

The earthquakes exposed a small part of the enormous web of corruption connected to the unfettered real estate speculation that unites all levels of the government, the capitalist parties (the PRI [ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party], the PAN [right-wing National Action Party], the PRD [nationalist-populist Party of the Democratic Revolution], Morena [Movement for National Regeneration, a split from the PRD], etc.) and private consortiums. Between 2000 and 2012, under federal PAN governments some seven million homes of “social interest” (for the poor) were built, the bulk of which are simply uninhabitable—rinky-dink dumps in remote housing developments lacking any services, prone to fire and likely to collapse with the wind and rain.

A handful of capitalists have augmented their already massive fortunes through these schemes, which involve Wall Street and imperialist institutions like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (see “Mexico’s Housing Debacle,” Los Angeles Times, 26 November 2017). At the bottom of society, due to extremely onerous mortgages, hundreds of thousands of working-class families have lost everything or are trapped in these unsanitary ghettos. Almost 150 years ago, Friedrich Engels, who together with Karl Marx founded scientific socialism, taught us that “the housing shortage is no accident; it is a necessary institution and it can be abolished together with all its effects on health, etc., only if the whole social order from which it springs is fundamentally refashioned” (The Housing Question, 1872).

Criminal Exploiters

The bourgeois media now speak of “solidarity” in an insulting campaign of flag-waving schmaltz. But the earthquakes showed, once again, the ineptitude, insatiable search for profit and disregard for human life and suffering on the part of the capitalist class, its state and its entire system. The 1985 earthquake brought to light the inhuman situation of industrial textile workers, especially women, when in the very center of the city almost 1,600 workers died. They were without a union, were paid miserable wages and were crammed into improvised workshops in rickety buildings packed with heavy machinery. Now, in the miserable Obrera neighborhood, a building collapsed that housed a dressmaking workshop and other businesses. To date, it’s not clear how many workers perished, given that in most cases textile workers lack any legal benefits, and thus there is no reliable count of the workforce.

The September 19 Seamstresses Union was born out of the 1985 catastrophe. Today it has been practically destroyed due to attacks by the government and the bourgeoisie. Mexican workers organizations have been the target of an incessant offensive by the bosses since the 1980s, in the face of which the bulk of the trade-union bureaucracies have simply ducked for cover. In 1985, unions like the SME electrical workers, which was destroyed in 2009 by the PAN’s [Felipe] Calderón, and the miners and steel workers mobilized to carry out rescue work. But this time the battered organizations of the working class were absent. The extensive solidarity that was displayed lacked the discipline, experience, skill and class content that only the workers movement could provide.

It is necessary to revitalize and strengthen the unions by organizing the masses of workers that do not have union representation. The existing union leaderships are without exception pro-capitalist bureaucracies that tie workers to one or another bourgeois party and inculcate in the working class the notion that the capitalist state is everlasting. To unchain the proletariat’s enormous social power, a struggle is needed to replace these bureaucracies with class-struggle leaderships committed to mobilizing the working class in the interest of all the exploited and oppressed.

Bourgeois State to the “Rescue”

With medical and rescue services overwhelmed, authorities asked the population for donations of everything from water, milk and tools to adrenaline. The shelters that were improvised were often unsanitary and exposed to inclement weather, especially in the countryside. At least a large part of the food and necessary supplies for the homeless came from the population. These donations were the object of innumerable cases of corruption by the government and bourgeois parties.

In this ever more militarized society, the government’s only plan when faced with disaster situations is the mass mobilization of the forces of the capitalist state (the army, the navy, the police); firemen, paramedics and other rescue services barely exist. While the military may have participated in rescue efforts, the overwhelming majority of soldiers and navy men do not have the slightest training for such tasks: their job is to repress. In fact, while there was no shortage of assault rifles, the detachments of soldiers lacked shovels, pickaxes and any basic tool for removing rubble in search of trapped survivors. The police, meanwhile, are the guard dogs of the bourgeoisie, plain and simple.

The bourgeois state is a machine of coercion directed against the exploited and oppressed at the service of the capitalists and their regime. In that vein, a central purpose of the state forces was to intimidate the population and protect private property from “looting,” i.e., desperate people procuring necessary consumables. The real looters are the capitalists, who squeeze out of the workers their very last drop of sweat and blood! Just as in 1985, the cuerpo de granaderos [riot police] soon cordoned off disaster areas to contain the indignation and rage of residents, who still did not know the fate of their relatives and friends when the government decided to end rescue efforts and bring in heavy machinery.

“Reconstruction” and Bourgeois Philanthropy

Oozing elitism, PRI president Peña Nieto, with Miguel Mancera of the PRD (head of the Mexico City government) at his side, announced with great fanfare that he would grant the capital’s homeless 3,000 pesos [approximately $160] a month to pay rent for up to three months—an amount barely enough to pay for a room. Owners of collapsed homes in the city will receive mortgage credits of up to two million pesos [$105,000] for 20 years at 9 percent annual interest. Those who lost everything, maybe even their families, can now acquire one more debt with the capitalist government and bloodsucking banks.

Peasants in Oaxaca and Chiapas were promised 120,000 pesos if their homes were destroyed and 15,000 if they only suffered “partial damage.” In Chiapas alone, almost 17,000 homes collapsed. The racist Peña Nieto sermonized that with the money, people should have enough to build “decent and dignified two-room” homes, as long as they don’t spend it on something else. This was an allusion to the vile stereotype of indigenous people spending all their money on alcohol.

Having promised 120,000 pesos, the cruel government reconsidered. Since a good number of homes still had a wall standing, such damage was in the end considered “partial.” So the government deducted 105,000 pesos from those affected. In any case, many of the homeless in the southeast have protested that they haven’t received a single peso, since they were given bankcards without funds.

The same builders who, hand-in-hand with the government, are centrally responsible for the tragedy will now make a killing from reconstruction, including of Catholic churches, which will be paid for out of public funds. However, in a display of Christian compunction, the “private initiative” (the bosses) donated four billion pesos, and the Vatican gave alms of $150,000 (not enough to rebuild even one of the lavish churches). That kind-hearted soul Carlos Slim [telecom magnate] “raised” 2.3 billion pesos, money that was “donated” basically by hundreds of thousands of people paying the monopolistic phone charges that allowed him to become one of the world’s richest men. Sweet philanthropy! As Engels wrote of the bourgeois philanthropic hypocrites in 19th-century England:

“As though you rendered the proletarians a service in first sucking out their very life-blood and then practicing your self-complacent, Pharisaic philanthropy upon them, placing yourselves before the world as mighty benefactors of humanity when you give back to the plundered victims the hundredth part of what belongs to them! Charity which degrades him who gives more than him who takes; charity which treads the downtrodden still deeper in the dust, which demands that the degraded, the pariah cast out by society, shall first surrender the last that remains to him, his very claim to manhood, shall first beg for mercy before your mercy deigns to press, in the shape of an alms, the brand of degradation upon his brow.”

—The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845)

No Illusions in the Capitalist Parties!

Now that the child has drowned, they want to cover the well. Facing popular pressure, [Andrés Manuel] López Obrador (AMLO) and his Morena promised to donate a little more than 100 million pesos for the homeless. The other capitalist parties will also donate part of the millions they get in subsidies to those affected by the earthquake, even though they, along with government authorities, had originally met the proposal with indignation. In the face of growing discontent, López Obrador wants to offer a little more carrot without easing up on the stick. AMLO is a bourgeois populist committed to the capitalist order—he and his Morena are no less enemies of proletarian victory than are the PRI, PAN and PRD.

AMLO bases his whole 2018 presidential campaign on rhetoric against the “corruption” of the “mafia in power.” But corruption is inevitable under capitalism. And don’t forget, it was successive PRD Mexico City governments—starting with López Obrador in 2000, when he was still in the PRD—that unleashed real estate speculation. Criminal corruption around permits and supervision of construction in the city occurred for the most part under its PRD governments, as well as borough administrations under Morena (in Cuauhtémoc, Tláhuac and Xochimilco) and the PAN (in Benito Juárez).

There is without a doubt disgust and anger at the capitalist rulers among the Mexican masses. After September 19, Secretary of the Interior Osorio Chong and municipal president Avelino Méndez Rangel of Morena confirmed this for themselves when they had to haul ass to save their hides from the fury of residents of Obrera and Xochimilco respectively. But what is missing is a class understanding. The masses’ miserable situation, as well as the rulers’ disdain for human welfare, are not the products of the policies of one or another party or individual, but rather are inevitable characteristics of the capitalist system based on private ownership of the means of production.

For a Workers and Peasants Government!

Half of this country is in an area of intense seismic activity, and practically the entire coastline is under the annual threat of hurricanes. In Mexico City, one of the most populous cities in the world, danger from earthquakes is increased by the fact that a large part of it is built on a lakebed. Scientific institutions as well as the government were fully aware that a new and potentially catastrophic earthquake was just a matter of time. Though earthquakes, like other natural phenomena, are unpredictable, technology exists that can give the population some advance warning, depending on the distance from the epicenter. But preventing disasters is far from capitalism’s priority. In this society everything, including science, is subordinated to the enrichment of a handful. The agency responsible for the famous (and most often inaudible) seismic alert system is a private entity, an obscure civil association called CIRES, that offers early-warning systems for more than 50,000 pesos. And Mexico City’s supposedly strict anti-earthquake construction standards are worth nothing when making money is involved.

Incapable of providing everyone with safety, health care, decent housing and employment, capitalism deserves to perish. Against the bourgeoisie’s speculation and fraud, in order to reconstruct disaster zones and tackle unemployment, we are for an extensive plan of public works and housing improvement under union control—let the workers themselves ensure the quality of materials and construction—and for a sliding scale of wages and work hours. A struggle for goals like these would light the way toward the necessary revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. A workers and peasants government—the dictatorship of the proletariat supported by the peasantry—would put science at the service of society, which would at least help minimize the effects of natural disasters.

Faced with rural misery, workers are forced to cram into cities in search of some way to survive, living in rooms as dismal as they are expensive and often lacking basic services. As a basic and immediate way to begin solving the housing problem, a workers state would expropriate the opulent residences of the possessing classes and open them to workers who are homeless or in overcrowded housing. We communists work to see the day when the true producers of society’s wealth occupy the mansions and luxury apartments of the Polanco and Las Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhoods…and the presidential residence at Los Pinos!

Workers and peasants in power would fight to overcome the contradiction between the city and the countryside. Such a regime would seek to eliminate ancestral rural backwardness by bringing all of modern society’s advances to the countryside: decent, comfortable housing; roads; schools; telecommunications; industry and scientific agriculture; etc. As a result, a huge, chaotic, overpopulated, dirty, polluted city like Mexico City, which is sinking and collapsing, could gradually be eliminated.

This perspective is not realizable without the international extension of the revolution, especially to advanced countries like the U.S. and other powers, which would put enormous resources inherited from imperialist capitalism at the service of the world’s vast dispossessed and oppressed masses. It is necessary to forge Leninist-Trotskyist parties, following the example and experience of the Bolsheviks who brought the Russian workers and peasants to power in 1917. Such parties would fight for socialist revolutions internationally to destroy capitalism and set the foundations for a new society, where those who labor rule, on the basis of the collectivization of the means of production. Humanity’s struggle against blind nature requires the expropriation of the capitalist expropriators and the establishment of an international planned economy dedicated to satisfying human needs.

"Non marxist socialism? This is probably very naive question and can be atributed to my ignorace on the subject. As I understand, marxist theory was the basis of all historical socialist systems. I might be wrong. There were some differences so official ideology of USSR was marxism-leninism. Some reactionaries such as Oswald spengler called their ideology socialism but from what I read about it it had nothing to do with actual socialism. That's is also the case with some ""left-leaning"" neofascists. I might be wrong about that. But are some other non-marxist socialisms? As I understand it, Marx wrote the most thorough critique of capitalism and the reason to reject capitalism is because it is bad, to put it simply.

That being said, I strongly believe that the Kremlin just openly fucked us all, especially those who are just starting their careers and families. Instead of finally starting to invest in families and communities ([Russia's maternity capital programme](https://pfr.gov.ru/en/matcap/#:~:text=Maternity%20(family)%20capital%20is%20a,adoption%20of%20a%20second%20child), for example,  is barely new, investment in education and childcare was just about starting up again since COVID, [poverty has been a problem since 2015 and the figures are not falling despite meagre efforts to lower them](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/391591564381077495/pdf/Strengthening-Social-Protection-Towards-more-effective-social-assistance-in-Russia-An-update-of-the-system-performance-considering-new-national-target-of-halving-poverty-by-2024.pdf)), we are sleep walking into war with our neighbours. Instead of focusing on growth, prosperity, and the ""rise of Russia"" that propagandists like to rant about, we are going to spend money on potentially the most pointless conflict in our history.

Sanctions are going to hit any growth we've seen in real wages, and jobs are going to become scarce as businesses in Russia and elsewhere will hesitate to expand or even to start. Poverty in Russia (which mostly affects young families and homes with children) has remained stable despite efforts to lower it, now the money used for those programmes will go straight to war and to Donetsk and Luhansk.

As some Muscovites were saying yesterday, there were no income supports during the COVID lockdown because the money wasn't there. Now it turns out we have the cash for adventurism in Europe. Every Washington hawk just had their insane ramblings confirmed. Every millionaire Russian propagandist (Solovyov/Kiselev) just had their work programme for the next fifty years handed to them.

my friend was right. the term does make me think more. it makes me think about how insufferable my fellow liberals can be with their constantly changing language standards. i am sick to death with this game of sensitivity one-upmanship. this term accomplishes nothing. it sounds like something a person who speaks english as a second language might say. plus, it makes way less sense than homeless, linguistically. a house is a specific type of dwelling. someone living in a condo is technically ""houseless"". i will never say houseless.",Liberal

"Need advice as President of my high schools Feminist club I joined feminist club with my best friend this year (our sophomore year) and due to us basically being the only ones who still showed up to the clubs zoom meetings and the only ones running for office, we automatically got to be president and Vice President. Along with another nice girl who will be secretary (she’ll be logging our hours and taking attendance in meetings). Me and my friend have big hopes for the club. Though I enjoy the discussions we have. Me and my Vice President are really hoping to find new ways to make feminist club fun and interesting and actually have more than a few members. 

This year the average meetings consisted of making group PowerPoint slides about a discussion topic (some type of social justice issue, which often never included womens rights/issues, but still important social justice issues) and just talk about it in the meeting. Sometimes people didn’t really have much to say or maybe didn’t feel very comfortable to turn on their mics. There’s weren’t a whole lot of attendees in the meetings, I’ll admit I skipped some myself, because they could get pretty boring and it starting feeling like homework having to make slides on the group PowerPoint. Just wasn’t the best atmosphere, I mostly blame it being online.

I’d like to focus a bit more on feminism and women’s issues, while still including discussions on other social justice issues. And I have ideas for fundraisers with some of my favorite charity’s. Maybe feminine hygiene or food drives. And also maybe team up with our schools GSA for some meetings/events. But also how can we make it fun and enjoyable for members? And draw members in and keep them engaged in the club? It’s difficult for us to think of ways to make a club that focuses on such serious issues fun. Next year we can do in person meetings so hopefully we can get more participation. 

Overall, I would really love some feedback on ways we could make the meetings more fun and interesting. And some fun event ideas. Really any advice on how we could improve the club and keep a good amount of members engaged would be so appreciated. Thank you!",Liberal

We cannot allow anyone to control women's bodies.  These kinds of things happen too often.  This is why we must protect bodily autonomy: all women in the US, regardless of citizenship, must have complete control over themselves including their reproductive choices.  To allow others control over women's bodies results in horrors.

I identify as a social democrat because I admire the social democratic projects in Europe, and want to bring my country in that direction. I am conflicted on using the word liberal, but it was a complicated meaning. Excluding the ways the word in used outside of America, in colloquial use it can refer to either a center left or more centrist person. I'd be fine using the term if I was, for example, in the 60s during the New Frontier and Great Society projects. However, the term now also includes centrist or too moderate types.

"Socialist ideals in a capitalist society like the U.S. I have had many conversations about my hate for capitalism and the atrocities we’ve seen because of it. Yet nobody bats an eye and rebuttals with “the system works and that’s the price of the American dream”.

"Socialism exists only when people receive profits/money. When charging, everyone is a capitalist.  

So maybe some people have already thought about what I am about to say. But I have never personally heard anyone use my argument against socialism.

Workers/socialists these days keep saying how the profits belong to them and they hate capitalism. And I have seen people like Ben Shapiro defend capitalism and offer counter points like the business owners deserve the profit because they invest money and take all the risks etc.

But what I realized is that in reality, there is no such thing as a socialist. Everybody is actually a capitalist. Here's why: Lets say a company makes phones that cost them $50 to make. Then they sell it for 500$ to make $450 profit on each phone. **Now the 'socialists' claim this profit belongs to them. But the irony is, such a big profit exists only because you charged customers like a capitalist!**

I mean, why would a socialist charge 500$ for something that costs 50$ to make? That's capitalist pricing technique. A socialist would have to sell it for 55$, which means there won't be any profits to share in the first place.

Thus friends, it brings me to the realization that **there is no such thing as a socialist. People are only socialists when receiving money; when charging, everyone is a capitalist.**",Liberal

"To say ""socialism has never worked"" is just as silly as saying ""capitalism has never worked"" Every time (or most times) when someone advocates for a better system where people are treated more fairly and equally, where their basic needs are met and they are guaranteed a good way of life, similar to the ideals of socialism, they always get shot down by weak points. ""The Soviet Union is proof socialism will never work!"" ""People starved under socialism!"" ""Venezuela and Cuba are socialist hellholes!"" etc, yet they ignore the issues and present/current problems under capitalism.

1. For the ""**People starved under socialism!**"" point, the world’s farmers produce enough food to feed 1.5x the global population. That’s enough to feed **10 billion** (we are at 7.6 billion currently). Despite this excess, hunger still exists. Today, 795 million people are hungry. [Another 2 billion are expected to join them by 2050](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/). Our inability to feed the entirety of the world’s population is mostly due to food waste. [Globally, 30–40% of all food is wasted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41173771_Food_Security_The_Challenge_of_Feeding_9_Billion_People). In less developed countries, this waste is due to lack of infrastructure and knowledge to keep food fresh. For example, India loses 30–40% of its produce because retail and wholesalers lack cold storage. In more developed countries, the lower relative cost of food reduces the incentive to waste. And as portion size grows, more and more food gets thrown out and wasted. Our food distribution system is inefficient. But this inefficiency won’t drive 2 billion more people into hunger by 2050. This is under capitalism. ( [We produce enough food to feed 10 billion people. So why does hunger still exist? | by Jeremy Erdman | Medium](https://medium.com/@jeremyerdman/we-produce-enough-food-to-feed-10-billion-people-so-why-does-hunger-still-exist-8086d2657539#:~:text=The%20world%E2%80%99s%20farmers%20produce%20enough%20food%20to%20feed,billion%20currently%29.%20Despite%20this%20excess%2C%20hunger%20still%20exists.) )
2. For the ""**The Soviet Union is proof socialism will never work!**"" point, even though the Soviet Union was one of the most repressive and deadly regimes in history, and many outright atrocities were committed against the Soviet people through the years. But even the worst governments may do something right. For the Soviet Union, most of these things were a huge contradiction to other Soviet policies.

The Soviet Union was ahead of the West in women’s rights. Although many of their rights were given out of necessity, Soviet women had [more opportunity in employment](http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/moderneurope/molly-wolanski/) and politics than Western women for most of the 20th century. By law, women in the Soviet Union had the same employment opportunities as men and tended to work in jobs that Western women couldn’t. However, that was a double-edged sword because Soviet culture also demanded that women take care of housekeeping after their day jobs. As a result, women spent more time working than men.

Shockingly, the Soviet Union encouraged tourism within its borders. By law, workers got two weeks off from work every year and were given vouchers to travel to certain tourist destinations, including Sochi. Vouchers to Sochi were given either in the winter or the summer. The use of free vacations played a practical role for Soviet leaders. First, it was an attempt to ensure loyalty by giving people some positive impressions about the government. Second, it gave the Soviet people a feeling of independence and empowerment, which was sorely missing from other aspects of their lives. Third, it allowed workers to rest and recover from their jobs, which was meant to [ensure peak production](https://books.google.com/books?id=5m_bcKBMMKkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=soviet+union+free+vacations&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibtb_w-LbKAhVQ72MKHYw3CVgQ6AEILzAA#v=onepage&q=%20free%20vacations&f=false) when they returned to work. New mothers also received [free maternity leave](https://books.google.com/books?id=vJJaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA167&dq=soviet+union+free+vacations&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb2tf3-LbKAhUD2mMKHShNBw84ChDoAQg2MAI#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20free%20vacations&f=false) as part of the Soviet health insurance system. This allowed mothers to take time off with their babies while having access to necessary medical care.

In 1920, the Soviet Union became the first country in Europe to completely legalize abortions for women. It was not until 1936 that another European country caught up to the Soviet Union. That was the year that [Iceland legalized abortions](https://books.google.com/books?id=EBmIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&dq=soviet+union+abortion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpqLTf0OvKAhUB7mMKHbESAHcQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20abortion&f=false). Like many things in the Soviet Union, reproductive rights suffered during the Stalin era. Concerned with low population growth, Stalin outlawed abortions in 1936, just as Iceland was legalizing them. In 1955, Soviet women were permitted to have abortions again. At the time, this was a limited right, only applying in cases where the mother’s life was in jeopardy. Later, universal reproductive rights were reestablished. Soviet abortion policy was seen as following [Leninist ideologies](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2060137?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), which promoted the idea that a woman should not be forced to have an unwanted baby. Over time, [abortions became increasingly commonplace](https://books.google.com/books?id=HOl-SqBouGIC&pg=PA203&dq=soviet+union+abortion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpqLTf0OvKAhUB7mMKHbESAHcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20abortion&f=false) in the Soviet Union, with most women having at least one during their lifetimes. Still, the Soviet Union was at the forefront of reproductive rights legislation in Europe.

For a country that had huge issues with environmental contamination, the Soviet Union and its puppet states had a large-scale recycling program for their citizens. In the 1970s, Soviet leaders began to set up recycling services that were extensive for the time, even if most people took a while to use them. Twenty Soviet cities had major [recycling plants for paper](https://books.google.com/books?id=s84zAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=soviet+union+recycling+program&source=bl&ots=wcck932IXA&sig=7CvA2sQ78cl7UltCEb138aZQjyc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj98-200-vKAhVY0mMKHWPDDgMQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20recycling%20program&f=false), with almost 30 percent of all paper recycled in the Soviet Union during the 1980s. Compared to the 270 kilograms (600 lb) of paper used by Americans per capita in 1989, people in the former Soviet Union only used about 10 kilograms (25 lb) per capita that year. This was partly due to the [Soviet culture of reusing material](https://books.google.com/books?id=8eI7zhLGHlYC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=soviet+union+glass+recycling+program&source=bl&ots=epKWApfOBt&sig=i8TzVM9DL4v6AxphDc1gBDHyRXg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFiLPK0-vKAhUW7WMKHW2wCUsQ6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20glass%20recycling%20program&f=false). Soviet citizens also had access to glass recycling centers that sometimes paid them to return glass bottles. During the Soviet regime, [plastic was rarely used](http://understandrussia.com/packaging/) in consumer goods. Plastic bags did not appear until the 1980s. For most of the Soviet years, people reused their bags or used their own containers when shopping for food. Plastic bottles were also uncommon, with most bottles made of glass and easily recyclable. This reduced the amount of waste produced by the average citizen and compared favorably to other industrial countries.

Before the rise of the Soviet Union, Russia was mostly an agrarian country that did not have an effective industrial economy. In this way, it lagged far behind other countries in Europe. However, one of the most important things that the Soviet regime did for its country was to bring it into the modern world. During the [Stalin era](http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/8/stalin-and-the-drive-to-industrialize-the-soviet-union?ab=X63-3&utm_expid=22625156-1.jO__KIIlQVuEPc9uLGsmiQ.1), the Soviet Union underwent a massive industrialization process. The minor economy of the tsarist era was transformed into an industrial powerhouse that rivaled other first-world countries. All of this happened in the 10-year period from 1928 to 1938. Overall, the Soviet Union [industrialized at a faster rate](http://ibatpv.org/projects/soviet_union/collectivization%20and%20industrialization.htm) than any other country previously had, which improved the lifestyles of its citizens. Between 1929 and 1934, the Soviet Union achieved a 50 percent increase in industrial growth and an average annual growth rate of 18 percent, which was an unprecedented leap in output. Of course, the news wasn’t all good. Many products manufactured in the Soviet Union were of low quality. But industrialization helped the USSR to become a first-world country. Former Soviet states like Russia and Ukraine became effective world economies.

The Soviet Union emphasized education, especially in [science and engineering](https://books.google.com/books?id=XbeazCBcp3EC&pg=PA188&dq=free+education+in+soviet+union&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivgt2wkLzKAhVL8mMKHaeuD9gQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=free%20education%20in%20soviet%20union&f=false). Soviet law guaranteed all citizens a free education regardless of their social standing or income. Unlike other countries at the time, this education extended to college and postgraduate work. Some people received their doctorates without paying tuition. The education plan [covered all costs](https://books.google.com/books?id=rIsj8I4Zw6oC&pg=PA219&dq=free+education+in+soviet+union&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivgt2wkLzKAhVL8mMKHaeuD9gQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&q=free%20education%20in%20soviet%20union&f=false) of attending school, including textbooks and school supplies. The Soviets also [built universities](http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/archive/anglosov.htm) and extended the possibility of education to developing republics in the USSR where education had previously been unavailable. For example, Belarus had no universities before the Soviet Union existed. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Belarus had 22 universities. The effectiveness of the Soviet education system is clear from the number of [great scientists and mathematicians](http://www.sras.org/science_in_russia_and_the_soviet_union) that came out of the country.

Throughout its history, the Soviet Union had strict drug control, which became more repressive over time. This was the opposite of the trends in the West. Soviet policies focused on criminalization of drug use and did not do much with drug rehabilitation or addiction recovery. But it did result in essentially drug-free neighborhoods. Of course, there were still drug users in the Soviet Union. But their number was incredibly small, mainly confined to elitists and people in prison. Both groups [got their drugs from gypsies](http://www.angelfire.com/linux/vorlin/) who smuggled them into the country.

3. For the ""**Cuba is a socialist hellhole!**"" point, lets start with Cuba first.

Cuba provides free health care for its people. As a result, [life expectancy](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&hl=en&dl=en&idim=country:CUB:USA:CAN) for Cubans (79.13 years) is higher than for Americans (78.64 years).

* There are 23 medical schools on the island, meaning Cuba has the [highest doctor-to-resident ratio](http://www.socialmedicine.org/2012/07/30/about/cuba-leads-the-world-in-lowest-patient-per-doctor-ratio-how-do-they-do-it/) in the world (1:155).
* Skilled Cuban doctors are sent to countries [where they are needed](https://theconversation.com/by-sending-doctors-to-italy-cuba-continues-its-long-campaign-of-medical-diplomacy-134429), such as Italy, El Salvador, Haiti, Venezuela, and even the US.
* Cuba spends 10% of its entire national budget on [education](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html). As a result, education is free for the whole population at all levels of advancement (including university tuition). School uniforms and meals are also free.
* The Cuban literacy rate for over 15's is 99.8%. This is higher than in America (99.0%).
* The constitution guarantees Cubans the right to recall their politicians. If they want their leaders out, they can vote them out.

Its funny how capitalists bring up Venezuela also in this arguement. Such a weak talking point.. The fact that you **have** to compare the US to Venezuela really shows how you have to compare the US to a country like that to try and make the US look better.

So overall, before you fully demonize socialism and say it ""never worked"", take a good look at the downsides of capitalism. Even with socialist policies, they can help to greatly improve countries (like Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, France, etc. But remember all those their countries are capitalistic, not socialistic).

"Explaining the Marxist methodology (Wall Of Text) Marxism is not an ideology to be implemented, but a mode of analysis of capitalism which suggests that the inexorable tendency of capitalism is towards its abolition by a global propertyless working class.

From *The Holy Family*:

> It is not a question of what this or that proletarian, or even the proletariat as a whole, may imagine for the moment to be the aim. It is a question of what the proletariat actually is and what it will be compelled to do historically as the result of this being.

Marx was consistent about this. From *The German Idellogy*:

> Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.

And from his letter to Arnold Ruge, written when he was twenty five:

> Nothing prevents us, therefore, from lining our criticism with a criticism of politics, from taking sides in politics, i.e., from entering into real struggles and identifying ourselves with them. **This does not mean that we shall confront the world with new doctrinaire principles and proclaim: Here is the truth, on your knees before it! It means that we shall develop for the world new principles from the existing principles of the world. We shall not say: Abandon your struggles, they are mere folly; let us provide you with true campaign-slogans. Instead, we shall simply show the world why it is struggling, and consciousness of this is a thing it must acquire whether it wishes or not.**

What the Marxist does, therefore, is analyze the prevailing system to see in what direction it is tending. Marx believed that there were certain innate and predictable tendencies within the capitalist mode of production which would lead to certain inevitable outcomes.

Part of the problem with Marxism - indeed, possibly the main problem with Marxism as a historical set of theories promulgated by Marx - is that Marx's own writings on this subject are scattershot, and his predictions spread out among responses to other philosophers and analyses of then-current world events. I am going to attempt to condense most of the relevant anticipatory/predictive writings of Marx here; I think they tally well with the direction that the world is visibly heading in today.

Marx's most expansive description of the future world revolution comes from *The German Ideology*, an early work written in 1844. The following text constitutes the meat of his prediction:

> This “alienation” (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. **For it to become an “intolerable” power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity “propertyless,” and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development**. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise **bcause without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the “propertyless” mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones**. Without this, (1) **communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples “all at once” and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism.** Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers – the utterly precarious position of labour – power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life – presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a “world-historical” existence. World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.

Marx states that there are requirements are necessary for the world revolution:

1. Capitalism must have globalized the whole world, and - this is essential - have made individuals ""*world-historical*"". This implies a high degree of development in communications and information technology from Marx's day, which we will again address soon.

2. Capitalism must have created a ""propertyless mass"" of wage laborers on a global scale. In Marx's time, 1844, this was not yet completely true - outside of Western Europe and North America, pre-and-proto-capitalist conditions prevailed everywhere. This is, however, true today -- and the Western middle-class seems to be in the early stages of being rendered ""propertyless"" via a process Marx terms ""immiseration"", which we'll address momentarily.

To the first point, Marx consistently rejected the presupposition of later Marxists like Mao, Lenin, Castro etc. that a legitimate anti capitalist revolution could occur in underdeveloped, proto-capitalist nations, where ""each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism"". He wrote the following on the subject in his *Conspectus Of Bakunin's Statism & Anarchy*:

> **A radical social revolution depends on certain definite historical conditions of economic development as its precondition. It is also only possible where with capitalist production the industrial proletariat occupies at least an important position among the mass of the people**. And if it is to have any chance of victory, it must be able to do immediately as much for the peasants as the French bourgeoisie, mutatis mutandis, did in its revolution for the French peasants of that time. A fine idea, that the rule of labour involves the subjugation of land labour! But here Mr Bakunin's innermost thoughts emerge. He understands absolutely nothing about the social revolution, only its political phrases. Its economic conditions do not exist for him. As all hitherto existing economic forms, developed or undeveloped, involve the enslavement of the worker (whether in the form of wage-labourer, peasant etc.), he believes that a radical revolution is possible in all such forms alike. Still more! He wants the European social revolution, premised on the economic basis of capitalist production, to take place at the level of the Russian or Slavic agricultural and pastoral peoples, not to surpass this level [...] The will, and not the economic conditions, is the foundation of his social revolution.

So it follows that for Marx the revolution will not occur in precapitalist nations. But Marx's revolution requires an exceedingly high degree of communication and coordination between capitalist nations -- and here we look to his posthumously-pubkished set of notebooks, the *Grundrisse*, wherein Marx anticipates the emergence of something like the contemporary information economy (he was familiar with early computers via the Victorian inventor Charles Babage):

> Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. **The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process...**

> ... But, once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the machine, or rather, an automatic system of machinery (system of machinery: the automatic one is merely its most complete, most adequate form, and alone transforms machinery into a system), set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, **so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages.**

Marx anticipates a data-driven information age that can produce ""world-historical"" individuals on a global scale.

Finally, there is the concept of immiseration - the processes inherent to capitalism which reduce the vast majority of humanity into a state of ""propertylessness"". To whit, this does **not** mean abject poverty - as Marx noted, mass absolute impoverishment would simply reproduce the "" filthy"" business of existence. Rather, the working class, globalised and interconnected, must be reduced to a level rentier status, where most of the necessities of life are directly provided by the employer and rented, without the existence of intermediary strata, which the capitalists must transit to buttress their falling rate of profit: globalised corporate hegemony on a maximum level.",Liberal

"The 99 Percent Economy on updating Monetary Socialism for the 21st Century (on Paul Adler's work) [The 99 Percent Economy
How Democratic Socialism Can Overcome the Crises of Capitalism by Paul S. Adler](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_99_Percent_Economy/ZjGoDwAAQBAJ)

In the work above, Paul Adler makes the case for a monetary form of socialism in the 21st century.  Relevant excerpts are below:

> We should expect enormous opposition to this socialization of property from the current private owners. To compensate the current owners—including all working people whose savings had been tied up in stocks, bonds, and land—**the government will issue long- term annuities.**

[...]

> This ring will include some entire industries, **such as banking and finance**, telecommunications, public transportation, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, energy, automobile, steel, aluminum, and the defense industrial base.

[...]

> And any external financing of these [smaller private] enterprises will come from banks, which, being now publicly owned, will use our democratically determined strategic criteria to **make credit-allocation decisions**.

[...]

> We will encourage these [publicly-owned] enterprises to compete on quality and service by **setting a common price for their services**. (If we allowed competition on price, we would be creating a powerful incentive to squeeze labor, and that would be contrary to our goals.)

[...]

> Financial incentives are a second tool. **We will offer workers a collective bonus** that rewards them if their enterprise achieves high output but also penalizes them if their output is either below or above the target. This will help ensure that the economic councils are receiving good information from the enterprises about their capabilities.

[...]

> The consumer banks will operate like savings and loans associations, **paying interest on savings and charging interest on consumer loans**.

All this is in accordance with an outline of a monetary form of socialism provided in *The Social Revolution* by Karl Kautsky, *when he was a Marxist*:

https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1902/socrev/pt2-1.htm

> I speak here of the wages of labor. What, it will be said, will there be wages in the new society? Shall we not have abolished wage labor and money? How then can one speak of the wages of labor? These objections would be sound if the social revolution proposed to immediately abolish money. I maintain that this would be impossible. Money is the simplest means known up to the present time which makes it possible in as complicated a mechanism as that of the modern productive process, with its tremendous far-reaching division of labor, to secure the circulation of products and their distribution to the individual members of society. It is the means which makes it possible for each one to satisfy his necessities according to his individual inclination (to be sure within the bounds of his economic power). As a means to such circulation money will be found indispensable until something better is discovered.",Liberal

"Walter Reuther: The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit This man is an American hero, arguably a hero to the world, and should be better known. 

Walter Reuther was born in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1907 to immigrants from Germany. He had four siblings. On Sundays his father, Valentine Reuther, would encourage the whole family to engage in vigorous debates about the social issues of the time. Walter said of his early years, ""At my father’s knee we learned the philosophy of trade unionism. We got the struggles, the hopes and the aspirations of working people every day."" At one point in his childhood, he and his brother Victor went with their father to visit Eugene V. Debs, who was at the time in prison for speaking out against American involvement in WWI. When he was younger, his family could not afford underwear, so his mother made some out of empty flour sacks.

He left home and worked in Detroit for several years, but in 1932 he was fired for campaigning for Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas. He and his brother Victor left the U.S. and toured Europe and found work in the Soviet Union. Walter regularly wrote critical letters to local Soviet newspapers complaining that the communists were poor managers. He later became ardently anti-communist, and joined the Democratic Party after being impressed by President Franklin Roosevelt.

The brothers returned to Detroit and organized sit-down strikes with the United Automobile Workers. In 1936 they unionized General Motors after a 44 day strike in Detroit and Flint, Michigan during which workers blocked police and strikebreakers from entering the GM plants. Workers across the country engaged in solidarity strikes (which are now illegal in Australia, the Netherlands, the U.S. and the U.K.). Their biggest target for unionization was Ford Motor Company, but Henry Ford was quite adamantly anti-union. In 1937 Walter Reuther was passing out fliers about unionization in Dearborn, Michigan when he was brutally beaten by Ford's private security forces, who had a record from a 1932 incident of shooting striking workers. Nevertheless, Reuther persisted and in 1941 the Ford Motor Company was unionized. 

During WWII, Reuther was instrumental in converting America's manufacturing capacity from making cars to making planes. This was the ""Reuther Plan."" In 1953 President Eisenhower wrote Reuther a letter saying, ""When I last addressed a CIO Convention, I came to thank you for your magnificent performance in World War II in supplying the planes and tanks and ships and arms. You did your job, and you did it well.""

Following WWII, the UAW continued to gain in strength, due in no small part to Reuther's leadership and willingness to organize strike actions. George Romney, father of Senator Mitt Romney, representing business interests, called Reuther ""...the most dangerous man in Detroit because no one is more skillful in bringing about the revolution without seeming to disrupt the existing forms of society."" On multiple occasions people attempted to assassinate Reuther, including once in 1948 when someone fired a shotgun at him through his window while he was eating dinner. They also tried to kill his brother Victor with a shotgun blast in 1949, when Victor had just returned to the U.S. from working with labor unions in Germany and the U.K.

In the 1960s, Walter involved himself and organized labor in the environmental movement, a variety of Civil Rights struggles, and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. He proposed the idea of a Peace Corps to JFK. He helped fund and organize for the March on Washington, the NAACP, boycotts and marches. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Walter Reuther saying, ""More than anyone else in America, you stand out as the shining symbol of democratic trade unionism... One day all of America will be proud of your achievements, and will record your work as one of the glowing epics of our heritage.""

Sadly, Walter Reuther and his wife May, along with several others, died in a plane crash in 1970. Coretta Scott King, widow of MLK, spoke at the funeral. 



I wanted to share all of this because I feel like I myself don't know as much as I ought to about the labor history of my own country. Walter Reuther was there in the thick of it at critical moments in the history of 20th century America and I've only learned about him since becoming more interested in the history of labor movements in particular. And he really ought to be remembered because he is a downright inspiring figure.

"How has communism seemingly overtaken the American internet, while Democratic Socialism and even Social Democracy is left unheard? I know many of you here might not subscribe to Democratic Socialism ideas because it would stray away from basically all of capitalism. I personally enjoy certain aspects that capitalism has brought, but I still see the evils of such a system, and fully in support of Social Democracy as a transition into whatever the fuck is better than what we have now.

But far too many times have I tried to state my bias against capitalism only to be called a Mao loving dictator cocksucker. When the ideals of socialism have changed from a transition into communism, and more so a cooperative workplace that places workers rights and unity at the forefront, without hoping a dictator would distribute wealth evenly? (At least a certain subset of Socialism, e.g Socdem)

Current and past Communist regimes are as far away from its ideals as it could be, and the only way to even achieve a Communist state would be through gradual socialism and the equalization of all humans, but Capitalism and the choice to do whatever you want is itself a good thing, just that oppression and inequality is the bane of its existence, and it will NOT be fixed unless Democratic Socialism or even Social Democracy is achieved in place of Capitalism, not as a replacement, but as an evolution.

So if real ""communists"" who probably haven't ever read its basic principles, are against the oppressive capitalist USA regime, why the hell do they trust that a dictator and one party state is not consolidating power and wealth just like the Central banks of capitalism? Sure maybe if Buddha himself came back and lead the world into communism it might work, but absolute power corrupts absolutely no matter what the intentions to start off with?

Why has the only real alternative to fixing this horrifically oppressive inequal system of Capitalism, drowned out by dictator Communists, and then in doing so, having us grouped with ""Big government"" when in reality that's the exact thing we are trying to resolve? It baffles me to think that a lot of intense right wing republicans have been so indoctrinated to the American ""freedom"" that they think having tax cuts for the rich enhances their own freedoms as an American, without realizing just how much they are being oppressed. Living in propaganda without a view of the outside world is exactly how North Korea is able to never get a revolution. Americans think they're smart, but they're just as brainwashed as North Koreans when it comes to their own personal oppressions. It baffles me how few Americans really embrace other cultures to see how much better life would be without lobbyists and big corporations.

Is there still hope for a Social Democracy in America? Bernie sanders was as some may believe, cheated out of running against Biden. With a two party system in place, how will we achieve true democracy, and finally equalize the wealth distribution?

I'm still learning about the various different socialistic principles and the spectrum of the left, its horribly disjointed and a probable cause as to why nobody knows what the fuck Socialism is. But I just feel absolutely hopeless, everywhere I look, I can see my self being oppressed. Every item I buy, every transaction I make, person I meet, somehow it all leads back to the rich benefiting from it more than me. Every game I buy, I just know there's some wagecuck dev getting whipped everyday by their CEOs to meet deadlines, every indie game I support I just know some corporation is taking 30% cut of their product just to release it. Every business I buy from is getting fucked over by the big advertising agencies that oppress everyone and force them to use their platform or die without.

The exploitation is ingrained, and I don't know if we can ever equalize it, maybe I'm completely wrong about socialistic ideals, and maybe this entire rant didn't even make sense, but I just want to know if at least we'll ever escape this exploitation?

Edit: Also, how the hell can Bernie call himself and his ideas Democratic Socialism, when he appeals to millennials who enjoy the benefits (be it very slight) of capitalism? You look up Dem Soc and you see people wanting to abolish capitalism for absolute socialism through democracy, which is absolutely impossible because of how ingrained we are into Capitalistic ideals. I can't even personally imagine a world without it, let alone kids in a world without a new iPhone every year. Social Democracy is achievable, Democratic Socialism is not, unless a revolution happens, then it would just be Socialism and not Democratic. But with all this conflation, grouping, and misuse of communism as a tag for all socialists, are we truly, and utterly fucked?",Liberal

"Day # 7 of Me posting a Socialist Leader for every day in January - Ali Soilih **ALI SOILIH (1937-1978)**

Bio

Soilih was born into a comorian family in the town of Mahajanga Madagascar on January 7th 1937 and spent most of his youth and early adulthood  on the island. during the 1960s he traveld to his family's ancestrial home of the Comoros Islands, where he worked various jobs for most of the 1960s. around 1970 he became involved in politics and developed a Socialist and anti-colonialist position, heavely infuenced by Maoism, He also renounced Islam and became an athiest during this time. He was opposed to the continued French colonialism on the Islands and campaigned against it. Soon after the islands became independent in 1975 he launched a coup against the established government and became the leader of Comoros. Folowing his rise to power Soilih held a referendum on whether the people wanted him in power wich go a yes vote of around 60%, following this he began to implement Socialist and progressive policies and sought to modernise the country and make it as self sustaining as possible. Amoung the polices implemented by Soilih were nationalisation of industry, legalisation of Canabis, the banning of tradtional ''extravigantly wasteful'' and expensive wedings and funerals, lowering of the voting age to 14 and challeges to Islamic power on the islands, eg. promoting girls not to wear veils. During the 70s Soilih formed his own verision of Mao's Red Guards called the 'Moissey.''

France was angerd at the Socialism being implemented in it's former coloney and covertly supported various coup attempts by reactionary and local Bourgoesie elements on the islands who also opposed Soilih. On May 13th 1978 A group of French Mercenary thugs led by infamous Right-wing neo-colonialist, and Anti-Communist Bob Denard, stormed the capital of the island, gunning down civilans and brave members of the Moissey who tried to form a desperate defence of the city. Soilih was captured, detained interrigated and ex-judically executred a few weeks later by the mercenaries who also had execute the few Socialists who had survived the coup. Denard then installed a pro-Capitalist and Pro-French ruler on the islands.

"Why are you not an anarchist? Hi,

This is for everyone, anarchist or not. Anarchists can respond to some concerns I have and minarchists can elaborate as to why they aren't anarchists.

So I am very much a market socialist. I know a lot of socialists don't see that as an end goal, but I do.

Whether that final form of market socialism takes the form of libertarian market socialism (i.e. left minarchism mixed with market socialism) or mutualism/some form of left wing market anarchism (Proudhon or Gary Chatier or something like that).

That's my own personal view anyways, this isn't just for market socialists.

So, first, some definitions:

Anarchism: the abolition of all unjust/coercive/involuntary hierarchies (this includes the state and capitalism)

Minarchism: abolition of a lot of all unjust/involuntary hierarchies (certain coercive ones remain in place, primarily: the state)

\-----------------------------------------------

Anyways,

I am hesitant to call myself an anarchist cause I am not neccesairly opposed to the existence of government or some hierarchies.

Let me explain:

I would advocate for a political structure based on the political structure of democratic confederalism or participism: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory\_politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_politics). Think a growing series of councils starting on the neighborhood level all the way up. That would be my end goal. However that is a permanent governance structure for legislation and whatnot. Now, one reason I want to keep a small state is primarily for dispute resolution. See, I have asked about dealing with stuff like externalities or dealing with various disputes between different communes on a variety of different anarchist subs and forums online. Ultimately, the answer usually boils down to some form of direct action. So, like, if a factory is polluting a river and your commune drinks from that river, you would be justified in sabotaging the factory. Perhaps there is a case to be made there. But I feel like there are intermediary steps that can be taken. When I ask about this, sometimes third party arbitration, boycotts/cutoffs of resources, expulsion from wider regional confederations are all suggested. Perhaps that would work, but unless the decision is binding a commune could just go on. Hell, I heard an anarcho-commuist suggest that to solve the issue of the tragedy of the commons that liberals bring up is to exclude people who don't play by the rules. But how do you do that without some form of coercion? I have other concerns as well, notably concerns that anarchists don't seem to win that often. Like, they usually lose. It happened in Catalonia & Ukraine. The modern day libertarian socialist movements aren't pure anarchist movements as old (I have seen many call the EZLN and Rojava not anarchist, I am more in line with the thinking of the Zapatistas and Rojava, so I guess not anarchist)? Idk, to me it seems difficult to coordinate on a larger scale without a governmental structure/body politic of some kind. If Rojava and the ELZN aren't anarchist, but rather libertarian socialist, I guess that puts me in the broader libertarian socialist camp as opposed to anarchist.

Then there are some hierarchies which I am not really opposed to, such as that between a child and parent, which I saw an anarchist in I think either r/Anarchy101 or r/Anarchism advocate for, but I could be wrong about the sub. There are other hierarchies like that that I am not opposed to for the most part.

Idk, like I said I bounce around. So, why are you/aren't you an anarchist? Do you consider Rojava to be anarchist (Rojava + market socialism is basically my ideal world)? 

I think of myself as a libertarian market socialist, usually some form of left-minarchist, but idk if I fit under the anarchist label.",Liberal

"Why do you guys think Authoritarianism and the alt right are gaining traction? It’s weird to me after seeing all these alt right protests and it completely boggles my mind. Sure a few anti vax and truckers will tell you that they aren’t Nazis, but a lot of them are okay with it. 

A lot of protestors shout bigoted remarks and have been shutting down a lot of Canadian businesses in the process. 

But I’m just completely confused. These alt right conservatives and republicans want a smaller government, yet they wave around Nazi flags? 

They don’t want the government to tell them what to do, but when someone tells them the rich are controlling the stock markets they literally do not give a single fuck, even if their own pensions are being slowly siphoned away? 

Are most of them just hoping one day they can become billionaires and then hopefully be able to exploit others? 

I know things are pretty bleak, but how will Fascism solve anything? Why can’t people just realize that we can still vote for a better world, and before anyone says “well voting won’t change shit!!” 

Well no shit??? You’re all still voting for the tired ass corrupt politicians, and when someone who at least cares about the people, nobody votes him in, and worse than that, call him an idiot who will ruin our economy.

To add to that, most of the blue collar workers voting for the right are the same ones losing teeth because they can’t afford dental??

"Question about Germany's energy production in the context of Ukraine and Russia Germany has been seen as not being as willing to engage in conflict with Russia as other countries in Europe. I realize that's a very simplistic take, but the reason for that is presumed to be related to the amount of natural gas that Germany gets from Russia and wants to get in the future, which is a constraint on how tough Germany can be with Russia.

That aside, what is the problem with Germany scaling up its renewables (primarily solar and wind)? Is it a raw materials problem? A lack of capital? A lack of expertise? Why does Germany not already have electric heating in homes powered by renewable energy?

A brief glance at the wikipedia page on German energy policy seems to suggest that Germany is really leaning on regular consumers hard to pay for the transition to renewable energy.

Even PAL from The Mitchells vs. The Machines is kind of an example: she may be evil for a reason unlike these other examples, but she wasn't redeemed and her death was treated as a joke, even though her creator had already reformed, while, say, Future Sara gets to live (and I really wanted that bitch dead.)

The reason why I hate this trope with a passion and notice it happening regularly is because I've always found evil male AI hot, especially if they're one-dimensional/Chaotic Evil. Evil male AI with a reason are good too (Brainiac's line ""I *am* Krypton"" anyone?) but I just like writing lore about generic evil male AI. It may sound sexist, but it's a preference, and I do not harbor hatred towards real life women, even the ones who voice these evil female AI (only really wanting them to make up for it by voicing good female AI, who I think are hot.)

"Community Goal and Principles / Rules / Announcements Hi folks,

We have [a document explaining this community's goal and principles](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/wiki/about). We've also instituted formal rules and additional documentation as concrete examples and to make it clearer and easier for community members to report transgressions.

[Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is a site-wide baseline that volunteer moderators enforce. In particular Reddit prohibits [Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or). This is synchronous with our Rule 3, *Oppressive Attitudes and Actions*. NB We've explicitly included the axis of sex.

We have [rules and guidelines for submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/wiki/submissions). We've instituted an [Accessibility Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/wiki/accessibility) and provide some useful information. This also applies to links in comments.

Reporting content is the best way to surface rule violations to moderators. Every other method requires that we explicitly check it, which in most cases means it gets lost in the clutter. Thank you to our community members who do!

* We've been calling for a hate speech policy on Reddit for years. Reddit finally instituted one at the end of June 2020 so we've taken down the call from our sidebar.

"Ax tax or sledgehammer tax; a term I've been hearing quite a bit in American progressive circles, not as much online but I don't think it's completely regional either. I finally been able to peg it down. Basically it's a very heavy tax on the wealthy, description below ***""Axe tax""*** aka ***""Hammer tax""*** aka ***""Sledgehammer taxes""*** -

This is a term that I've heard repeated quite a bit lately, mostly in face-to-face or digital face-to-face gatherings. The exact term very slightly, but I don't think it's a completely regional expression among progressives. 

Basically it's a punishment tax for billionaires. Essentially it's a incredibly hefty tax levied against the very wealthy, that is devastating, like an axe blow or a hammer blow. A tax of 105% or more. Forces people who make more than a billion dollars, sometimes people who make more than a few hundred million a year, to sell off assets to pay their taxes. Making it fiscally damaging to make that much. 

Also included in this is a number of other theories and elements. This kind of tax also has to come with a change of residence tax; billionaires have no loyalty to their country, and will leave. That usually is to be roughly 70%. I've heard anywhere from the 45 to 90s. I've also heard that there needs to be some sort of forced interest tax on those individuals who would cease to invest their funds if it's kind of tax took place, usually something like 10+%. Basically just enough to eat up there interest or a good portion of it. 


Now the method to implement these taxes and a plutocratic society is a completely different matter. I just thought maybe people just have heard this before and would like to know what these terms are. They aren't anything specifically in terms of numbers, however they more or less amount to being the same thing; an incredibly heavy tax meant to shake up resources.",Liberal
"Am I a social democrat? I believe that basic things needed to live (land, healthcare, utility, etc.) should mostly be either nationalised or subsidised.

Corporate power must be combatted with regulation, nationalisation, anti-trust legislation amongst similar measures.

Outsourcing is bad, it not only infringes on national sovereignty but also harms local businesses and workers. It must be combatted through tariffs and subsidising local industry.

Income taxation should be progressive, way less for the poor to pay and way more for the rich to pay. The upper echelons of society have an obligation to help the needy. I also support a national land value tax.

Labour rights should be strongly protected and unions should have a say in how corporations are run.

The war on small businesses must end, they must be subsidised and startups should be funded. Small businesses must be able to compete with big ones.

The means of production must be owned between the workers and employers with state intervention when necessary. 

Economic planning is very bad and evil however the market must be directed to prevent failure.

Large private monopolies must be broken up at all costs.

Regulation on things like labour rights, environment, equal treatment and fair market need to be implemented.

Socialism and capitalism have both failed, there must be an alternative. Socialism is inefficient and capitalism is selfish.

Welfare state good, welfare cuts bad.

Immigration must be controlled so that the nation does not lose too many jobs and we have enough resources to take care of everyone.

The government must be for the people at all costs. Populism is a must, it should be neither class divisiveness nor fake populism.  This will involve caring for the people and nation above all.

Economic inequality must be minimised. 

Democracy is good as the people have a right to govern themselves. The enemies of the people (theocrats, corrupt officials, monarchists, globalists, foreign puppets, separatists, totalitarians etc.) however must be purged to keep democracy efficient and inclusive.

well how is this capitalism's fault? you see, capitalists only care for their own profit. food, water, vaccines, etc can all be distributed to countries that need them. just look at afghanistan for example. western countries were able to evacuate thousands of afghans, yet they aren't able to distribute food, water, and vaccines? another example, why does the UN have to ask elon musk to end world hunger? why can't they ask the u.s? this is because it's not profitable for the u.s to end it. furthermore, i firmly believe that it should be normalized that capitalism kills 20 million per year. thoughts?


edit: there was an error in my math, malaria actually kills 600,000 per year. ive also decided to add more issues which kill millions

9 million+3,575,000+1.5 million+600,000+18 million+5 million=thirty-seven million six hundred seventy-five thousand

They are boomers, born in 59, not very political, but they occasionally watch Fox sometimes which is....anyway they have threatened to kick me out and cut me off from their credit cards because of my beliefs. I read theory, and am heavily involved in community organizing, but they keep saying that I should have grown out of this already and that a ""real world job"" would make me think differently. But they can't get it through their heads that they are so enveloped in white consumerist proto-colonialism and cis-patriarchy that they are blinded to the plight of workers globally.

While most politicians are bought by corporations and probably won't care about people writing to them I think we should nonetheless attempt to help this bill get passed because  it prevent employers from using health insurance to coerce people into staying into their jobs and not unionizing.

If someone can put a template letter that would be great otherwise il try and make one tomorrow.

We should write to all the democrats in California state senate and legislature because while some already support it others are more hesitant and we need to convince them that supporting this bill is good for their chances to get re-elected by writing them.

As for the republican in both chambers we should still write them and ask them to support the bill because while they would not vote for it maybe enough emails/letter could get a few to abstain.

 Thank you!

Hello name here,

I an writing you to urge you to strongly consider voting for Assembly Bill 1400 would set up ""CalCare,"" a state-run, statewide universal halthcare system, and Assembly Constitutional Amendment 11 would change the state's tax code to pay for it through a voter referendum. (Dont know the state of the amendment btw, i recomend yall to double check it)

Universal heathcare is incredibly popular among the electorate in California. A 2021 PNHP poll showed that of all likely voters in California support a state Medicare for All system by a +26-point margin, with 60% of voters supporting it.

Currently California has around 3,2 million uninsured citizens. By passing this legislation we could get it to zero, while cutting costs of millions of middle class Californians.

Universal healthcare is popular and would help nearly all Californians. Therefore I urge you to vote for this proposal.

"Here's how we fix a great deal of economic issues in America with just a single tax One of the biggest problems we face today is in regards to housing affordability.

To understand why, you need to look at price elasticity which falls into two categories: supply elasticity and demand elasticity. Demand elasticity has to do with how quickly demand will change in regards to price. For example, healthcare has an inelastic demand, much moreso than leisure. However, in a competitive market, that doesn't really matter. The problem comes when such a market is captured by one or a handful of providers. This can easily occur in a market with an inelastic supply because new providers can't easily provide more of that good. This is particularly the case with land which is about as close to inelastic on both sides as it gets. We need land to live and work on but land is a fixed good. Furthermore, not just any land will do because land in the middle of Alaska isn't as well desired as land in Manhattan or San Francisco.

There are three factors of production.

Labor: Effort by man to make or do something

Land: Anything natural such as natural resources or land itself

Capital: Anything made by man

Now the issue I take with this setup is that natural resources have more in common with capital than with land itself. Natural resources can't be made but they can be discovered. Even if it's non renewable, we can keep on discovering new reserves (that's why peak oil never happened). Furthermore, resources can be used more efficiently.

Land: Anything in fixed supply in which value can only be added through speculation. Examples include land, intellectual property, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and even geostationary orbits.

Capital: Everything else, mainly that which can be created through investment.

In the late 19th century, a man by the name of Henry George wrote a book called *Progress and Poverty*. In it, he sought to answer a question. The industrial revolution had given the US and UK so much wealth. Why then was there still poverty? Henry George's answer was that the ownership of land was the main culprit. His reasoning was that people (mainly those of affluence) were buying up land and gaining leverage over others. All of that investment in land left less left over for labor and capital. It wasn't just an affront to economic equality but also efficiency because land speculation hoards land from being used.

Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).

Henry George pointed out just how people can profit from land speculation without contributing to society.

>Take now... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: ""Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city—in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will in ten years, interest be any higher?"" He will tell you, ""No!"" ""Will the wages of the common labor be any higher...?"" He will tell you, ""No the wages of common labor will not be any higher..."" ""What, then, will be higher?"" ""Rent, the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession."" And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the *lazzaroni* of Naples or the *leperos* of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.

To fix this, George proposed a land value tax. It's similar to a property tax except it doesn't tax the whole property, just the land on which it sits. This would deter land speculation and incentivize land owners to use the land as efficiently as possible. It also wouldn't penalize upgrading property because it would only affect land. A whole movement started around it called the single tax movement. This movement competed with socialism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But for whatever reason, georgism died out. It's now seeing a slow revival in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which was caused by land speculation. Georgism saw sympathy from people like Albert Einstein, FDR, Hellen Keller, and Winston Churchill. Convincing people that this will be a good idea will most certainly be an uphill battle but enough people are talking about it, it can start a new conversation because we can't achieve the LVT if nobody's heard of it.

And the concept predates George. Thomas Paine in *Agrarian Justice* believed in implementing an LVT in addition to an inheritance tax of 10%. 2/3 of the revenue would go to people over 50 (life expectancy back then) with the remaining third in the form of a basic income.

Adam Smith was likewise very critical of land rent (that's where the phrase ""rent-seeking"" comes from).

He saw the LVT as the best way for the government to raise revenue since an LVT did not impose deadweight loss on the economy.

\*\*On 99% other topics I am a Leftist so It really hurts my soul that I am agreeing with Fox News. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

Okay, so just to preface this question, I absolutely hate Bill Maher. He has swung very far to the right and almost every single thing he says is verbal vomit. However, I just watched a recent clip of him criticizing American companies bowing down to the CCP and I feel like he has a point. America has engaged in many drawn out conflicts like the Iraq War, Vietnam War, Korean War, Afghanistan War that have killed millions of people and civilians. We have had our own concentration camps with Japanese Americans during WW2 and most recently concentration camps with Immigrants. We also have incredible income inequality and racism that we need to reckon with.

However, despite everything our country has, China literally deprives many of their citizens basic, human rights. They house 2 million Muslims in concentration camps, kidnap people who flaunt their wealth or talk badly about the CCP, and are currently literally trying to annex Hong Kong and Taiwan. I genuinely don't understand how the current day American Government is anywhere near as bad as China's. America doesn't do nearly as bad things to it's people as the Chinese Government does. I guess you could argue that America houses the most prisoners in the world and they tend to be black, but even then, we at least have a (extremely flawed) justice system that tries and convicts and provides consul to our people. It just boggles my mind that we can sit here and say that America's human rights abuses are even comparable to China's. We LITERALLY fought WW2 over a bunch of Nazi psychos who imprisoned millions of multiple ethnic groups and we are sitting here, in 2022, acting like China isn't doing the same.

We sit here in our extremely flawed country with certain unalienable rights that no matter how shitty our government is, they can never be taken from us. Despite this, thousands of corporations are acting like the huge human rights violations being committed in China are okay. I hate Enes Kanter and Fox News but they actually make a good point with the NBA being complicit in accepting human rights abuses as is. Its so crazy to me that they virtue signal all this stuff about BLM and then turn their backs on Muslims. Its just very sad I don't know anymore.

"From Facebook to Policebook (Boston Indie) 2 Feb 2018 From Facebook to Policebook 2 February 2018

On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a notice outlining extraordinary plans by the social media company to monitor all the postings and messages of its users, censor independent journalism, and use artificial intelligence (AI) to report users to the police and intelligence agencies.

Zuckerberg began his post, released in conjunction with the company's quarterly earnings report, by declaring that 2017 was a ""hard year"" for Facebook. ""The world feels anxious and divided--and that played out on Facebook. We've seen abuse on our platform, including interference from nation states, the spread of news that is false, sensational and polarizing, and debate about the utility of social media."" Facebook, he writes, has the responsibility to ""amplify the good and prevent harm. That is my personal challenge for 2018.""

In Facebook's ""newspeak,"" this means that the company will act aggressively this year to suppress the spread of information online and censor content, under the guise of combatting ""fake news"" and ""Russian meddling.""

The truly ominous implications of this project are outlined in Zuckerberg's post. Among Facebook's initiatives, he writes, is ""new technology to detect suicidal posts that has helped first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly, and we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real time and remove terrorist content.""

In other words, Facebook has introduced AI systems to collect, monitor and interpret all the information posted on its social media platform. As always, the introduction of such a sweeping system of mass surveillance is justified with seemingly praiseworthy motivations. After all, who could object to measures aimed at stopping suicides or terrorist attacks? The actual purpose of the new systems, however, is very different.

Zuckerberg points to the sweeping scope of the company's artificial intelligence plans later: ""Our goal with AI is to understand the meaning of all the content on Facebook."" Every single post, photo, video, message, comment, reaction and share will be fed into the company's increasingly powerful computer systems to be analyzed for ""harmful"" content, and reported to the police and intelligence agencies as deemed necessary.

The real--and sinister--aim of Facebook's actions is also made clear by the other initiatives that the company is taking. Most significantly, Zuckerberg stressed the company's determination to make sure that ""the information you see on Facebook comes from broadly trusted and high-quality sources, in order to counter misinformation and polarization.""

What are these ""broadly trusted"" sources? ""For example, take the Wall Street Journal or New York Times,"" wrote the multibillionaire CEO. ""Even if you don't read them or don't agree with everything they write, most people have confidence that they're high quality journalism. On the flip side, there are blogs that have intense followings but are not widely trusted beyond their core audience. We will show those publications somewhat less.""

In other words, corporate media sources will be promoted, while other publications, even those that ""have intense followings,"" will be demoted. As for being ""shown somewhat less,"" what Zuckerberg means is that they will be blocked from reaching a broader audience. More simply, they will be censored.

In addition to censoring news from alternative sources, Zuckerberg states at the beginning of his post that Facebook is working to ""show fewer viral videos"" because such content is not ""good for people's well-being and for society.""

The viral videos Zuckerberg is referring to include footage of police violence, social exposures like reporting on last year's Grenfell Tower inferno that exposed social inequality in London, and documentation of the war crimes carried out by the US military. Any such content will be ""demoted,"" which Zuckerberg later notes ""reduces an article's traffic by 80 percent.""

Zuckerberg's central pretense--that Facebook will promote sources that ""people have confidence"" in--is a fraud. In fact, according to a Gallup poll published last year, Americans' trust in the mass media ""to report the news fully, accurately and fairly"" reached its lowest level in poling history, with only 32 percent of participants saying they have a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust. At the same time, the use of social media to read news has been growing exponentially, reaching two-thirds of the US population according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.

The growth in the popularity of Facebook and other social media networks was in large measure due to the fact that they allowed their users access to information and viewpoints unavailable through mainstream media outlets. Now, Facebook has reversed course and declared that its intention is to promote the official narrative and block independent news sources that question it.

Facebook, Google, Twitter and other giant social media companies--working closely with intelligence agencies and governments--are seeking to leverage their role as mechanisms of communication to become instruments of censorship and repression. In the process, they are turning one of the most important and liberating technological advances of the 21st century, the growth and expansion of artificial intelligence, into a mechanism for police control and dictatorship.

The fight against Internet censorship is an urgent task facing workers all over the world. The World Socialist Web Site is leading the fight against the greatest threat to free speech since the Second World War. On January 23, it published an open letter calling for an international coalition of socialist, antiwar, left-wing and progressive websites, organizations and activists to fight Internet censorship.

The principles for this coalition are:

• Safeguarding the Internet as a platform for political organization and the free exchange of information, culture and diverse viewpoints, guided by the principle that access to the Internet is a right and must be free and equally available for all.

• Uncompromising insistence on the complete independence of the Internet from control by governments and private corporations.

• Unconditional defense of net neutrality and free, unfettered and equal access to the Internet.

• The banning and illegalization of government and corporate manipulation of search algorithms and procedures, including the use of human evaluators, that restrict and block public visibility of websites.

• Irreconcilable opposition to the use of the Internet and artificial intelligence technologies to carry out surveillance of web users.

• Demanding the end to the persecution of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and the complete restoration of their personal freedom.

• Advocating the transformation of the corporate Internet monopolies into public utilities, under internationally coordinated democratic control, to provide the highest quality service, not private profit.

• The fight against Internet censorship and the defense of democratic rights cannot be conducted through appeals to capitalist governments and the parties and politicians who serve their interests, but only in uncompromising struggle against them. Moreover, this struggle is international in scope and totally opposed to every form and manifestation of national chauvinism, racism and imperialist militarism. Therefore, those who are truly committed to the defense of democratic rights must direct their efforts to the mobilization of the working class of all countries.

"Conservative father says ""Inflation is due to increased wages."" Any truth to this? Can someone educate me?

He responded with ""Increased wages lead to more inflation. Inflation is a regressive tax on the poor and elderly on fixed incomes. Last year this time a gallon of gas was $1.50, now it's near $3.00. Who does this hurt the most?""

Is inflation actually due to increased wages?",Liberal

"Social liberalism So as I’m sure most of you know in the USA we don’t really have a large social democratic movement at all, a few politicians exist like much of the progressive caucus and arguably Bernie sanders (he’s more of a democratic socialist but they are very similar). What we do sort of have is social liberalism (or just liberalism in here). The question I do ask is how accepting of social liberalism should social democrats be as change is a long process and in most countries required a dramatic realignment of values or conditions that simply isn’t likely to occur in the near future. So what is the best way to reconcile these two groups until then without becoming subjugated to social liberalism or neoliberalism depending on who you ask (note I’m a soclib but there really aren’t any good subs or forums anywhere that discuss it in depth)",Liberal

A page summarising polling of the last 90 days: https://www.dkriesel.com/_media/sonntagsfrage_90tage.png

Three weeks after the federal election, all signs indicate the future government to be a social liberal ""Traffic Lights-Coalition"", led by the SPD, with the Greens to their left and the FDP to their right.

According to Forschungsgruppe Wahlen [ https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/politbarometer-ampel-scholz-kanzler-corona-schnelltests-100.html?slide=1631192701216 ], one of the most prestigious survey institutes in Germany, over 60% of germany favour this kind of coalition, while only about 20% are against it. The Union is weaker than it has ever been, dropping below 20% in most polls due to internal fights and scramble for power.

The three parties have been talking to each other for a while, and recently released a first paper about their goals for the upcoming legislation. It does seem a bit FDP-dominated in some areas, but overall, i'm pretty happy with it and hope most of it gets realised.

-

*What you can expect:*

The main focuses of this coalition would be:
-protection of the climate
-modernisation in all areas
-securing of pensions 
-reform of the welfare state and improved social security 
-development of the infrastructure, especially public transport
-digitalisation
-lowering of high rent prices and building more housing
-increasing equality for women, minorities and citizens of the states of the former GDR
-education
-debureacratisation and incrased cooperation between states and federal government
(+an election reform will happen in the upcoming legislation period, mostly to limit the size of the evergrowing parliament)

-

*On foreign policy:*
Not much would change.
Slightly more hawkishness, slightly more europeanism, potentially slightly decreased transatlanticism. Moreso if the Greens get to lead the ministry of foreign affairs, they really don't like Russia and China. 
They also want to protect refugees, not only in germany but also on their way to europe. The number of people dying on their way too europe and in the Mediterranean shall decrease.
(If Cem Özdemir [ https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cem_%C3%96zdemir ] somehow got to lead the ministry things might get chaotic for our relations especially to turkey. That will not happen though.)

-

*The paper, results from the first talks between the three parties:*

One interesting thing about the paper is, that instead of a ""Social Market Economy"", they called the economic system they want to make laws for a ""Social-Ecological Market Economy"".

Another notable thing was Germany being called a ""modern immigration hub"". Things will be made easier for immigrants and especially refugees. 

-

*MAJOR POINTS OF THE PAPER:*

-quicker exit from coal, possibly already in 2030

-immediate minimum wage raise to 12 euros

-lowering of energy prices, mostly by removing a form of taxes on energy

*What wasn't mentioned in the Paper:*

-The legalisation of marijuana was not mentioned in the paper, but is likely (pretty much guaranteed) to happen, as both Greens and FDP want it, while SPD aren't explicitly against it. Most likely, it wasn't mentioned because it will be rather easy to meet a consensus on this topic.

-Before anyone asks: nuclear energy was not mentioned in the paper, because there are no debates about it in Germany anymore - and please, do not spam comments about how you hate Germany for this or whatever, there have been enough threads about this topic for now, and not every post about Germany has too devolve into a fight about nuclear energy.

There is much more content to the paper, but i will not go over the rest of it since most of it is not that relevant and also because the exact agreements are not yet finished. I might give an update on this once the coalition contract is finished - if it gets finished. I am highly confident it will happen though.

Do note that of course not all of this will be realised. For some of these things, the constitution would have to be changed, requiring a two-thirds majority. 
I am also a bit disappointed that ways for the government to fund their spending were not mentioned much, other than cutting some spending, immigration, and making it easier for start-ups and innovation to have success and boost the economy.
For the rest however, i am hopeful that at least the vast majority can be realised without too many fights, finally ushering in a new era of a social-liberally ruled Germany, almost 40 years after the last such coalition ended.

"Want to overturn Citizens United? Get this federal statute passed. Here’s what it should say:

* (a)  All U.S. States, and all authorities delegated by the U.S. or any  state, territory or tribe of the U.S. with the authority under law to  create legal persons must include, in the charter, articles or  incorporation or other creating document, of all such created legal  persons, the following language:
* **“It  is expressly excluded from the purpose of this legal person for this  legal person to spend its operating funds with the intention to  influence or affect the outcome of any electoral, lawmaking or  rulemaking process of the United States or any state, territory or  tribe, including but not limited to such processes by administrations,  counties, cities or other subdivisions or delegations of the United  States or any state thereof. This express exclusion overrides any  contrary language within this document.”**
* **“In  the event that the express exclusion of the preceding paragraph is  found to be unenforceable, then all activities including the ownership  of property and the right to sue, but not including the ability to be  sued, are expressly excluded from the purpose of this legal person. In  the event that the exclusion of this paragraph is activated, no person  shall be shielded from liability by this legal person.”**
* (b)  All persons applying for the creation of any such legal person are  officially on notice of these provisions as of the date this law comes  into effect, and any charter, articles or incorporation or other  creating documents issued after that date which do not contain the above  language shall be treated at law as if they did contain this language.  Any authority who fails to include this language in such creating  documents is subject to mandamus in federal court.
* (c)  In the event that subsections (a) and/or (b) of this section are  judicially found to be facially unenforceable, then All U.S. States, and  all authorities delegated by the U.S. or any state, territory or tribe  of the U.S. with the authority under law to create legal persons are  hereby prohibited from creating any such legal persons from the date  such judicial findings become mandatory precedent to such state(s)  and/or delegated authority(ies). This subsection shall be interpreted to  extend exactly and only within the full extent of the constitutional  powers of the federal government of the United States.
* (d)  all existing laws whether state or federal which conflict with  subsections (a), (b) or (c) are hereby repealed to the extent that they  so contradict those subsections.

**Why does it work?**

Since  the Civil War, the United States has moved from a position in which  corporations required specific purpose statements in their charters to  allowing no specific purpose. This means that you can make corporations  that do anything. Before general purpose corporations, corporations that  did things that were not listed on their purpose statements could be  hauled into court under a doctrine called *ultra vires*.  Essentially, it was an argument that they had gone beyond the  limitations of the legal privilege of incorporation the government had  given them. Now that very few people use anything other than general  purpose corporations, the doctrine of *ultra vires* has all but died out for corporations.

But  if this language were written into the charter of a corporation, and it  then tried to influence an electoral process, the doctrine of *ultra vires*  would again apply, allowing the government, or in some cases,  shareholders, to sue the company for injunctive relief to prevent it  from undertaking the *ultra vires* action of attempting to influence elections.

**What about Freedom of Speech?**

The resulting lawsuits based on *ultra vires*  would not be founded on any federal law which restricted speech.  Rather, the lawsuit would operate based on the charter itself.  No one  would deny that it is the right of the government to control the terms  on which it issues charters, and no one would deny it is the power of a  charter to control the actions of a corporation. Effectively, this law  is simply the government saying that it chooses not to grant the right  of limited liability to anyone who would use it for this purpose.

*Citizens United*  is about the constitutional rights of corporations to speak. Since the  law in that case was a content-based discrimination, the law failed, but  this law does not actually restrict the rights of corporations to  speak. This law restricts the rights of incorporators to create  corporations for the purpose of speaking. Although a corporation may  only be able to speak by its financial maneuvers, incorporators are  completely free to speak through other means, so my estimation is that  this statute amounts to what’s called a time, place and manner  restriction rather than a content-based discrimination of speech. Even  if I’m wrong about that, I think the government-as-speaker exception  would arguably still apply.

There  is a small chance that the express exclusion in question might be held  unenforceable since a court might still find it to be a content-based  discrimination, but if that happens, the second paragraph (the suicide  exclusion) introduces a new exclusion which is not a content-based  discrimination and which effectively paralyzes the corporation from  doing anything at all. There is no doubt that this second section is  constitutional, and messing with it would be like disarming a very  touchy landmine for any corporate lawyer. And just in case they disarm  it too well, it tanks the entire corporate reproductive system  altogether. My guess is, nobody even tries to disarm it, and if they do,  no judge would be stupid enough to actually do it.

**What about a constitutional amendment?**

How’s that been going lately?

**What about staffing the courts with more liberal justices?**

If  somebody is willing to pack the court, I’m all for it, but nobody seems  down, so I thought I’d suggest we try this instead. Even if you were to  pull it off, it’s hard to know in advance they would actually overturn *Citizens United*.  The right case would have to come along, and they really couldn’t  promise to do so before or be held to any promises to do so later. It  becomes a game of personality politics. Iffy.

**Won’t the same lobbyists who have been running the show so far stop it from passage?**

Maybe,  but what’s nice about it is that it does not apply to the clients of  any of those lobbyists. Those lobbyists all represent existing  corporations, not new ones. Existing corporations can be told that  they’re about to get an extremely valuable permanent market advantage.  We can always have government lawyers hunt them down, find some evidence  of crime and revoke their charters if they get in the way later. Once  we get control of the political process again, putting the government’s  best and brightest lawyers and accountants on the job of nailing  multi-billion-dollar corporations to the wall should be reasonably  doable. One step at a time. First, we cut their balls off. Then we worry  about what’s left of them.

**But wouldn’t this hurt my favorite charity/think-tank/union/happy puppy farm?**

Not  much in my opinion. This law doesn’t prohibit governments from  recognizing organizations. It prohibits governments from creating  organizations. Partnerships are part of the common law and would be  unaffected. Creating organizations for purposes of lawsuits would be  unaffected since those are recognized in court, not created by  legislative power. What would be altered would simply be limited  liability of those organizations, which, if they’re not doing anything  sketchy, they probably don’t really need anyway. I mean, if your  favorite organization is trying to funnel dark money into electoral  politics, then maybe you should pick a new favorite organization, but if  you want to politically participate, this shouldn’t be a problem. Even  if you’re part of an organization that likes to keep its members secret,  what protections for that secrecy that do exist at law are not really  connected to the question of whether those organizations are recognized  as corporations.

Also, remember  this only affects new corporations, so unless your particular favorite  organization likes to make new corporations for some reason, it  shouldn’t make much difference. Even if (c) ends up triggering a  meltdown of the entire corporate reproduction system, the benefits lost  are mostly to investors who blow up chemical plants. Your puppy farm  probably doesn’t really need a lot of limitations of liability anyway.  At the very least, we’d be doing a Hell of a lot more damage to our  enemies than our friends.

**But what if (c) is triggered, and the nation needs a corporation for some reason?**

Don’t  know why it would, but there’s nothing in this law that would prevent  the federal congress from creating a new federal corporation the  old-fashioned way. Indeed, there never could be such a statute since  Congress has that implied power under the constitution. Furthermore, in  the unlikely event that (c) is triggered, I’d expect a clamor of federal  lawmakers rushing in to renegotiate a new deal based on whatever  judicial language ended up triggering it. They wouldn’t just leave it  unattended if it actually went off. That would be a moment of  revolutionary potential indeed.

**Could (c) be attacked on the grounds that it violates states' rights?**

I  think that's a long shot argument since it doesn't actually prohibit  the states from doing anything. It just prohibits them from  creating  organizations for the purpose of doing things, but in the event that I'm  wrong, the last sentence in (c) is there to minimize the damage any  kind of 10th Amendment argument might do. No one would argue that the  creation of corporations does not affect interstate commerce, so we're  definitely within areas of traditional federal power.

**Well,  if we’re going to be this radical, why do we have to stop with the  creation of new corporations? Can’t we go after the existing ones too?**

The  trouble there is that the corporations that already exist are going to  be harder to tackle with a statute. They’re already dug in and have been  found to have constitutional rights. We’ll have to take their  constitutional rights the same way we take everybody else’s away: make  up stupid laws and convict them of crimes. Or we could just tax them  until they go broke, but that’s all for after we’ve got enough control  over our own lawmaking processes that we can actually get the job done.

The  ability of these corporations to reproduce is critical to the way that  they control the government. If that’s stopped, then any existing  corporation playing the Super-PAC game can be exposed and the harm it  can do can be limited. From there, we can get enough control to finish  them off.

**Why has nobody suggested this before?**

"Dialectical Perspective on The Conflict in The Ukraine Comrades, as Trotsky once remarked, it is ""Astonishing how easily some comrades forget the ABCs of Marxism under the blows of events!""

Thus I'm wondering about the takes of fellow comrades on the conflict in the Ukraine. What stances should be taken from a dialectic perspective and how should this conflict be treated?

I personally realize the capitalist nature of the US (EU, NATO, ...) and also that Russia is an oligarchy. Therefore I say that a war would in fact not serve anyone but the leaders. And even then I question, what value really is to be won here for these rulers.

And though I consider peace to be the most valuable asset of our lifetimes, I wonder how the conflict should be treated. Russia rightfully feels threatened by the convergence of borders through the expansion of NATO  in former Soviet states. The EU and NATO claim to act in solidarity with  the Ukraine, though these statements rather sound like imperialist none sense. Deducing that the Ukraine has to remain a neutral zone sounds like an imperialist imposed conclusion. For the worker's safety, it  appears sound, however.

"Could the Democrats' Stupid Behavior Be A Long-Term Plan To Cripple Lefty Attempts to Gain the Presidency? I have so much trouble understanding why the Democrats are being such idiots as far as policy goes. They've been unwilling to end the filibuster. They got almost all of the the House ""progressives"" to allow them to decouple Buiild Back Better from the infrastructure bill, and of course in an entirely predictable move, Manchin tanked BBB in the Senate soon after. 

But Senate maneuvers aside, Biden won't even legalize marijuana, end student debt or do a number of other things he could do with a stroke of his pen, which are very popular with the American people.

Well, why the hell not? We have a lot of explanations from the media, none of them convincing. The polls are very clear on which issues are popular with the American people, and the Democrats are ignoring them, mostly. Undoubtedly that is primarily because their donors don't want them to. But here's the thing. It would be VERY easy for Biden to do something like legalize marijuana. The American people would love it, and the donors will not, for the most part, care. Also, there was a LOT of money for some American corporations (read: donors) in Build Back Better. Losses from one group of donors can be balanced out from donations from another group.

But the Democrats are apparently totally unconcerned, and by Democrats I mean the DNC Democrats, the corporatists who control the party. Why are they unconcerned?

One reason could be that DNC types don't care about winning. The money rolls in for the incumbents and their staffers and the firms that they hire no matter who's in power in Congress and the White House. The begging letters just change topic, is all. And that's a partial answer, I think. The Democrats are willing to lose elections. But there could be a deeper answer.

See, the corporate Dems know they have a problem. The progressive Democrats are that problem, much more so than the Republicans. The progressive Dems not only threaten their donor base directly, they also support all those policies that are so damnably attractive to their voter base, and are unattractive to their donor base. Thinking long term, they would REALLY like to spike the progressive Dem's chances of winning election, ever. And that's problematical, since the progressives are so damned popular and seem to be growing in popularity despite the mainstream media's obedient attempts to suppress progressive ideas and opinions.

Plus, the DNC types know they have weak prospects looking down the road at 2024. Biden's old and senile, and getting nothing but older and more senile. Kamala Harris is INCREDIBLY unpopular, and their anointed rising star, Pete Buttigieg, is also not popular. Their chances of holding the Senate and the House in 2022 are looking dimmer and dimmer.

So why not, if a loss is inevitable, take the opportunity to tank the progressive movement by letting a progressive win the primary in 2024, but only after the Democrats have stunk up Washington so thoroughly that he or she would have NO chance of winning against the Republican? The Republicans take the helm at the White House for another term, la-de-da. Who cares? The defeat is described as ""proof that America is not ready for a progressive Democrat of any kind"" and progressive dreams are stifled for a generation.

I realize that I am connecting a lot of dots that may not necessarily connect up in four years, but this would at least explain what's going on very neatly: a long term plan to tank the 2024 Presidential election as a tool to spike serious challenges from the left. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.",Liberal

"Day #4 of me Posting a Socialist Leader for every day of January -Maurice Bishop **MAURICE BISHOP (1944-1983)**

bio:

Maurice Bishop was born on the 29 of May 1944 on the island of Aruba, into a working class family of Grenadians (his father had temporaraly moved to Aruba shortly before Maurice was born, for work) When he was six his father moved the family back to Grenada. during his school years Maurice was noted for being an exelent student, during his secondary and higher education he first became exposed to Political ideas, and was active with the student newspaper and discussion group. Bishop was captivated by the Cuban revolution of 1959. In 1963 Bishop left Grenada to go and study Law in England at London Univercity. during this time he also traveled to Warsaw pact countries (Czechoslovakia & DDR) he also read the Works of Marx, Lenin,Mao and the theories of Julius Nyerere. During his time in the UK Bishop was active in the Campaign against Racism (CARD). Following the completion of his studies Bishop returned to Grenada in 1970.

Once back in Grenada Bishop became active in Leftist politics, helping with a nurses strike in 1970. in 1972 The movement Asssociation of People (MAP) was established by Bishop and others, it would unite with the Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education and Liberation to form the New Jewel Movement in 1973. In November of 1973 Bishop was injured in an event called 'Bloody Sunday' where police brutally beat Bishop and other Socialists. Bishop was closely monitored by the Grenadan government during the latter half of the 70s, who attemted to stamp out the New Jewel Movement. In 1979 Bishop and the New Jewel movement statged a Succesful revolution and began to implement Socialist polices as well as establish Diplomatic relations with Cuba. During the Period of New Jewel control illiteracy dropped from 35% - to - 5%, Healthcare was made free and universal and unemployment was massively reduced. 

In 1983 Infighting emerged within the New Jewel movement and Bishop found himslef opposed to his deputy PM Bernard Coard. Coard's Faction, with the support of the Army Placed Bishop under house arrest, this was met with mass protests by the people of the Island. Bishop attempted an escape on October 19th 1983 but was captured by several soldiers of the People's Revolutionary Army, who acting on their own accord, without orders executed Bishop and several other Prisoners before hastely burying them in an unmarked grave. Coard became the New leader of the New Jewel movement, but his time in power would be short lived as the USA used the politcal situation in grenada to Launch an imperialist invasion latter that month in 1983, which overthrow Socialism in Grenada.

I don't want to mention capitalism, or socialism in the post or language like that, because that can easily put off people in the early stages of their journey toward being a leftist, or make them think I'm trying to co opt black issues for political reasons. 
I'd especially like help on how to order the things I'm saying, what should be removed vs what should be expanded upon, and good things to include in the additional reasources section.

Here's the rough draft I have so far:


If you consider yourself anti racist, and an ally to black people, or even a decent human being, and don't want to be like the same people who did nothing while slavery was happen not fighting against, or questioning it then you need to read this, educate yourself. It may seem like the majority of the battle against racism is done, or maybe you've put in your part by supporting BLM, however that can't be farther from the truth. 
Our nations wealth has been, and still is built off the exploitation of others (especially minorities), with both being the larger now than ever. The exploitation our nations wealth is built off of is like a virus, evolving and responding to every attempt to stop it. If fighting against the exploitation of others isn't enough of a call to action, then consider this quote 

""The elite, cocky and filled with greed, will sell the rope that is used to hang themselves.""

It's projected that America will soon not be the wealthiest or most poweful nation on Earth, with the reason being the greed which led our elite to chase cheaper labor and less regulation being to blame. 

With it being black history month, and I'd like to remind you that America's racism is alive stronger than ever, with things far worse than slavery happening to fuel American consumerism and wealth. Most the world, but especially Africa carries the burden for our countries wealth and our comfortable lives, its a necessity to fight against that to truly care about black lives. The BLM movement was important for fighting for the rights of black people in our country, but they are a tiny fraction of the black people oppressed by us, and far from the ones worst effected. 

In the past we shipped African slaves to America to build our own wealth and expand our influence, its a fallacy that this dynamic ever ended or even improved. Now instead America builds its wealth in Africa directly by exploiting it's workers and reasources, topling any governments that challenge them, all under the guise of spreading our wealth and ideals (neither of which are true or help Africans.) 

It may seem hopeless when learning about stuff like this, or seem pointless to the point you think learning about politics/news is a waste of time, but trust me there's hope, you just need to believe in the humanity of your fellow man. The few always will have less power than the many, my hope lies in believing that with a true understanding of what shapes our society a majority of people will think it'd wrong and be willing to fight against it. When you believe this the only barrier to change is educating the many on the true enemy, I believe no matter how much propaganda and control is used the power of the truth can overcome. 

 The elite can and have easily toppled many countries that threaten their power, however the people there still fought despite this. As citizens of America we pose the greatest threat to the elite because our privilege, they can't use a fraction of the tools they use in other countries to stop a threat to their power here. While in other countries they can use military police, assassinations of political figures, destruction of economies, and much more, their main tools they can use in America itself are already in use. For their system to continue they need us to not know the atrocities they commit, the alternatives that exist, the fact we don't need them, and most importantly the power we hold to change things. Us feeling hopeless, apathetic, using all our effort to fix symptoms, instead of the root issues, and believing them is the glue that holds this whole system together. The majority of books on propaganda you read were directed at this exact system, not some theoretical society or far off land like North Korea. 

Here are some of the best videos and articles I've found to learn more about this topic and what you can do about it:

Should leftist political parties form contracts with unions such that if the parties help them (financially, by providing literature, with their organization, with their media presence, with supplying some of their striking materials like signs, etc.), then the union will have to endorse the political party when they run for public office?  If not this, then how can political parties work within and benefit from the labor union movement?",Liberal

"Been dreaming up a new political system, curious if it was popular here? I don't have much experience with politics but have been constructing this idea of a new system based on what seems most natural to me. People dislike the notion that a few hundred have the power to control millions. There isn't much of a way around this, but it should be possible to create a political system and government that better represents the populous, and more precisely to represent our best selves. My version of this “proportional representation” is as follows:

Everyone comes together to form groups of between one and three hundred people. These groups are geographically based and so every four years one must attend a local hall with your ""roughly"" 150 neighbours and vote on two representatives, largest proportion of votes wins. Understandably, fewer groups would be 'based' in rural Scotland than groups based in cities, per square mile.

The second step is how the political system is thus built upon this foundation. Assuming an average size of 150 people per group, in the UK there would be 400,000 groups, and these would be gathered into clumps of 10, each clump representing 10 neighbouring groups, and so about 1500 people. The two elected representatives of each group would come together and the twenty of them would represent the 2000 part time. This is the first rung/tier of the political system and the twenty of them would act as a sort of neighbourhood leader. Every four years they would vote for two of them to move to the next rung.

This second tier would form after 10 neighbouring pairs of ""first tier representatives"" came together and the twenty representatives would represent their collective 15,000. This second tier, would be paid a decent salary, would fulfil a role similar to an mp or district/county council, and serve a 4 year spell. The twenty men/women in the second tier would also vote for two of them to go on to represent in the third tier.

The third tier: This would constitute the two representatives of ten second tier groups coming together and representing their collective 150,000 people. Finally, the twenty in the third tier would nominate 1 person to enter a final tier of around 400 people. These 400 people would hold a position that could be comparable to the present-day government. The 400 would be composed of two groups of 200, in the UK there would be a northern group and a southern group. This is where the normal citizens can vote again. 5 representatives from each group of 200 will campaign much like the present day system and two of them will be voted through to fulfil the figurehead/leader role.

(Oh and the thing about pairs acting as representatives of the populous was partly inspired by the Roman democracy before the Emperors became a thing. They always had two heads of states, which yes seems ridiculous at first glance but apparently led to more balanced and wiser decision making. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul)

So everyone will have roots/access to those in power, it would be much more connected. Any thoughts or comments would be very interesting :) In my eyes this is true democracy, and I would love to see the sort of people who would end up making the societal decisions in this system, compared to who we have presently.",Liberal

"How my perception of the wealth gap has changed I recently came across an interesting [chart](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1275123151614115840/photo/1) that changed my perspective on the growing wealth gap. The S&P500 tracks the combined value of the 500 largest US publicly traded companies, expressed in USD ($). With the exception of brief recessions, it has shown persistent, steep growth since Standard and Poor's founded the index in the late 1950s. However if the S&P500 was priced in gold, (a non-inflationary form of money), the growth flattens with more pronounced corrective cycles. This is symptomatic of the federal reserve's quantitative easing (printing money out of thin air) and economic stimulus packages in full swing. So in other words, the S&P500 is not an indicator of economic activity by the biggest companies but a barometer of debasement of the dollar.

The S&P500 is an index that almost every institutional and serious retail investor has in their portfolio. Sovereign wealth funds and pension funds inflation proof the pension money of millions of ageing citizens by investing it in public companies like Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet etc, or in indexes like the S&P500. All private equity funds or hedge funds have their performance benchmarked according to the S&P500 as shareholders can just withdraw their money from the fund and invest it in the S&P500 instead. Most regular people who invest a portion of their paycheck, who don't have the time or confidence to follow specific companies, invest their disposable income in the S&P500. The whole reason why all entities, big and small, invest in indexes like the S&P500 is a hedge against inflation. 

Inflation is inescapable, given that we live in a world where central banks or national governments dictate monetary policy. Everything from interest rates to inflation is parameterised by them, which makes them responsible for incentivising behavior in the market. In 1971, the US got rid of the gold standard which had given the dollar ""world reserve currency"" status. It sought to maintain this status by coupling the value of dollars to oil sales on the global markets. Together with Saudi Arabia and OPEC, it created the petro-dollar which meant oil producing nations only accepted dollars for the purchase of their oil in exchange for military protection. So every country needed huge stockpiles of dollars to feed their glut for oil, globally distributing inflation caused by the fed, as opposed to locally in the US, giving the US supreme economic power. Wars were waged to impose oil for dollar trading on oil rich nations that suddenly stopped dancing to the US's tune. A big weapons complex industry grew bigger, the mainstream media became a propaganda arm of the US government, delegitimising the issue of climate change became a strategic objective by politicians and the rest is history. 

It is impossible to pin down motives and dependencies but what is clear is that there is a global super structure of governments, central banks, massive militaries, fossil fuel entities, and the mainstream media that direct ""the world order"". The actions of this cartel affects common people by recklessly creating market bubbles with serious implications on pension funds, job loss, and destruction of citizen investments. It affects people by locking them into permanent debt repayment for the reckless spending by the governments. It affects people by forcing them to subsidise the bad habits of certain crooked companies such as the bank bailouts of 2008. It immiserates working class citizens with little to no disposable income or financial literacy by reducing the buying power of their income.

This cartel is what you should be fighting. All concerns about unaffordable housing, unaffordable university, health care, tax evasion, regulatory capture pale in comparison. I used to think that things were not working correctly because of these issues, but it turns out that they are consequences of a deeper problem. Until we realise that both political parties in America are two faces of the same coin, and that everything wrong with capitalism is due to mis-parameterisation by this cartel, we will just be swatting shadows and radicalizing ourselves.",Liberal

"Opinions on clause 4 of the Labour party? What do people think of the old clause 4 in the labour party committing the party to the common ownership over the means of production? This clause was changed by Blair in 1994 removing any reference to common ownership or democratic control. Of course there are still many in the party that wish to reintroduce a new clause 4, Labour4Clause4 offer a new clause 4 which is more closely aligned with the original. 

“We stand for the inherent rights of all people to useful work, good homes, education, health care and dignity in retirement, free from all forms of discrimination. We believe that these rights cannot be fully realised under capitalism where human values are subordinated to the demand for profit. Our aim is to abolish the obstacles to the realisation of those aspirations. As a socialist party, we do not exist to manage capitalism. We aim to bring about a fundamental transformation of society, which will give to everyone a chance to live a full and satisfying life. We will adopt the means necessary for that purpose by, amongst other things, the common ownership, under democratic control and management by working people, of the commanding heights of the economy, including the banks and finance houses, the land and all the companies which dominate our economy. We stand for a democratic socialist society based upon the principle from each according to their ability to each according to their need.”

I was curious as to what people think of the original clause 4 written by the Fabian social democrats Beatrice and Sydney Webb and if they think it was a positive development that any reference to common ownership was later removed by Blair or if the party should reintroduce common ownership and economic democracy as an end goal.",Liberal

"Thoughts on minimum wage and living wage? Most studies have shown that a minimum wage equal to ~60% of the median wage doesn’t cause significant unemployment. 

In Canada (where I live), this would correspond to 33K per year. But keep in mind that someone middle class in Canada (which I would consider a very comfortable life) doesn’t keep their entire 55K. After taxes, they only take home about 43.5K. This means that someone making minimum wage (and pays no income tax) in this scenario would enjoy about 75% of the purchasing power of what someone currently middle class makes. I’d consider that to be quite a decent standard of living for the minimum wage!

"How thousands in Croatia met this winter without a home As many of you might know, Croatia was hit by 2 devestating earthquakes in 2020. One in our capital, Zagreb, and one in a very poor region of the Sisak-Moslavina county.
EU gave Croatia 5,1 billion HRK(aproximately 678 million euros) to help us deal with the earthquakes.
But, due to the ruling party being the right wing HDZ, which has had multiple corruption scandals and failures throughout its pillaging of Croatia(it ruled for the majority of time since our first democratic election in 1990/1991), we will be losing that amount. EU rules give countries 18 months to spend that money, our government barely contracted anything and spent a miserable 2%.
Meanwhile, people in the areas hit by earthquakes have to await this cold winter without houses. 
The devestating part is that private individuals and companies donated more than the government.
This is one of the many examples as to why the HDZ is a bad party. It will also hopefully finally make the people see that the HDZ does not care for the people, only their own private interests.
I thought to share this as we, as socialdemocrats, fight for basic human rights and conditions, and this is something that absolutely breaks people's rights and basic living conditions.

"Problem with socialist direct management? I used to consider myself a market socialist but the more I read, I realize that markets are inherently problematic and any sort of competing cooperative system would be parasitic in nature and lead to its own demise. 

Ideally, industry should be responsible to the people. The competing aspect of multiple industry can be done away with if the management of these industries is elected by the people instead of being incentivized to act at the workers and buyers expense whenever possible.

I have an issue, though, with workers electing managers of the industry they work at directly. If this were the case then would the workers not just elect management that will allocate most resources into their own leisure at the expense of production? 

Instead, why not have a state representative of the working class. And then have representatives of industry elected by anyone in the community who works. This would incentivize production as people would elect management of industry while prioritizing production as they will be consuming from them. There would also be mutual assurance of favorable working conditions across the board as one could not vote on managers of another industry that would dramatically cut working conditions to increase production without fear of the same happening to the industry they themselves work at.",Liberal

"Would you consider the film, ""The Green Room"", to be Agitprop? So about half a year ago, I decided to watch the Jeremy Saulnier film known as The Green Room. I thought it was going to be a fun gory punks vs nazis film. It was not. I immediately regretted watching it because it was too real to me, as in the band members in the movie were way too close to my sister's friends growing up and the scenario was way too realistic and likely to happen. I'm bad with horror films but usually the fear is contained to jumping at shadows and minor stuff for a night and then I get over it. I wanted to buy a gun after watching The Green Room.

"Thoughts on market socialism / if you are not a market socialist why? Hi!

I see social democracy as a good way to transition to my ultimate goal of libertarian market socialism coupled with a strong welfare system (like a state). Basically I want swedish welfare, Rojava style politics (i.e more power delegated to communities) and market socialist economics. I see social democracy as a very very good system, but one that can be improved on by removing the capitalism and ultimately transitioning to market socialism (I know a lot of us support worker coops). I guess that makes me more of a classical soc dem.

I am curious though, what are your thoughts on market socialism? Would you be on board with what I am talking about? If you are not a market socialist, why so?

"On Reddit, you're a man unless proven otherwise. Considering the trench of misogyny in which Reddit finds itself, it's a relatively small annoyance, but I see it everywhere. **Unless you post about a wacky mishap involving your boobs or your period, Redditors assume you are a man**. I know I'm not completely innocent of making this false assumption; I do it too, but so many comments seem to go out of their way to confirm that you are, indeed, a man. I once made a post about my experience with ADHD without including the fact that I'm a cis-woman and the first comment was ""this guy knows how to ADHD!"" Yesterday, I saw a popular post about what was clearly a mother dog being cute with her puppy and the top comment referred to the dog as ""he."" It feels silly to point out these pretty minor mishaps, but when you see it over and over and over again it just feels so blatantly ignorant. Once you start taking note, it's hard to not notice.

"This is the text of an email I just sent to Stacy Abrams of FairFight. Stacey Abrams
FairFight.com

Dear Ms Abrams,

First, let me say how much I admire your work. FairFight has accomplished so much for all of us. As a voting rights activist since 1987, I understand that protecting our right to vote requires constant vigilance and action.

""Voter suppression"" summarizes everything we are against in a snappy, two-word phrase that everybody understands at once. But we need an equally pithy way to describe what we are FOR - a motto, a rallying cry, something that will fit on a sign.

I suggest ""voter encouragement.""

As a social worker, one of my first jobs at the Center for Independent Living of North Florida was to work with our local Supervisors of Elections to train the volunteers to understand that voting rights for persons with disabilities requires flexibility and good faith, as well as ballots in braille, cards for communicating with deaf people, ramps and wide doorways and so on. So many people with disabilities had been discouraged from voting, especially by well-meaning people who's only solution to every problem was ""Use a mail-in ballot!"". 

What is voter encouragement? Ten days of ten-hour early voting. Transportation to the polls. Ballots in the necessary languages. Voter registration at the DMV. Strict enforcement of the laws banning voter intimidation in all forms, from anonymous threatening phone calls to crowds of angry people blocking the polls. You know the methods of voter encouragement better than I do.

We could say that we're for ""Voter Participation"" or ""Universal Voting"", but to my ears those phrases sound dull and lifeless. ""Voter Encouragement"" is upbeat and lively. Words matter, and powerful words matter most.

Thank you for all you have done, and for taking the time to read this.

"Does computer allocation and big data make the lange model viable in the 21st century?  

Hello,

So I have been spending a lot of time recently reading up on a very interesting Project in 1970s Chile called Project Cybersyn ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project\_Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn))  which was basically an attempt to create a computer controlled  centrally planned economy. As I understand it, this doesn't neccesairly  solve the Economic Calculation problem proposed by Mises because it  doesn't properly account for opportunity costs due to the lack of a  price mechanism. However, I also have read up on the Lange Model ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_model), [https://www.econ.iastate.edu/ask-an-economist/what-do-economists-think-lange-model-does-it-address-economic-calculation-problem](https://www.econ.iastate.edu/ask-an-economist/what-do-economists-think-lange-model-does-it-address-economic-calculation-problem)) which seeks to implement a price system within central planning to solve this issue.

Anyways,  long story short, I was wondering if combining computer planning to  speed up calculations and predictions of shortages/surpluses would make  the Lange model viable?

I  had a couple doubts, notably this system does have prices and  allocation calculations can be done by the computer, but the actual  allocation is done by people, and people don't always play ball. History  is full of cases of people skimming a bit off the top for themselves. I  would worry that corruption is still an issue at stake, as has been an  issue for centralized planned economies of the past. I also worry about  innovation. it's hard to predict future trends based on the past and  consumers often don't realize the value of a good until it is presented.  This was the case with vegetable peelers in the Soviet Union.

So  I have my doubts. Personally I prefer worker coops in an actual market,  not a state run one, but I;d love to see what y'all think.",Liberal

"Capitalistic Contradictions & Their Consequences (Narrated version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3Sgnt1Gsc))

The system of capitalism creates environments and goals that are contradictory to each other, and these core contradictions become amplified overtime until capitalist society collapses. For the benefit of the system, its participants and its media are dependent on ignoring and even distracting us from these very problems.

Initially, we are put on the treadmill of consumerism, quantity of products being prioritized over quality to keep this treadmill going. Another trend to follow, the newest version of a thing to buy, our living costs -- a bill that follows us until we die. Now, what is interesting about this constant-going treadmill of consumerism is that we are simultaneously expected to run on it and also bear the ball and chain of debt. We are expected to still continuously consume and purchase while suffering long-term debts from college and vehicles, and for the lucky few these days, mortgages. If it isn’t already nonsensical enough that you are expected to run on this treadmill of consumerism while bearing the ball and chain of debt, capitalism has devised a system in which that debt drives your further consumerism. 

Holding off a bigger ball and chain so you can run faster on the treadmill; credit card debt overtime became a necessity in modern capitalism. Not only to develop a credit score, but to push off the costs of your basic needs onto credit cards with the expectation that there will be some kind of magical “future money” later, I’ll elaborate more on this in a bit. 

See, this is a contradictory system. We cannot be expected to purchase and bear financial burdens at the same time, and the nonsensical solution of trying to turn those debts into something that will drive consumerism is even more absurd. Supremely absurd, however, is the capitalist response to the slowing of the treadmill of consumerism when these contradictions begin to halt it. 

Instead of finding these obvious contradictions at fault, they instead blame the consumers for the “wrong” type of consumerism. Don’t buy coffee, stop eating avocado toast, stop doing “this” and “that” kind of consumerism. Companies now treat consumer value as a zero-sum game that they must fight amongst themselves to divvy in their favor, when in reality, the increasingly extreme contradictions of consumerism create not a zero sum, but an actively shrinking sum game, where there is even less to divvy as anything non-essential is cut. 

A corporation will still blame the consumer instead of acknowledging the contradiction. “The millennials killed the suit industry” they’ll say, “people are buying less jewelry, less diamond rings, less luxuries” and we the consumers are still blamed for the contradictions of the system, for if the capitalists acknowledged these contradictions, they would be conceding to its critics. 

This consumer and debt culture -- it makes us dependent on the wishy-washy capitalist concept of “future money”. The “buy now pay later” kind of lifestyle. The racking up of credit card debts, and predatory loans with high interest rates that make them impossible to pay off. The funny thing about capitalism is that all that wealth will eventually be concentrated to the top. The funny thing about capitalism is that you will eventually run out of other people’s money. And then what? We run out and then we create future money. It’s all gone now, but there will be more later, surely! This system has to work! 

Here the world plays about with future money not even just on the consumer scale, but even on the scale of an entire nation. Drafting hundreds of billions of dollars for a military that isn’t in any major wars, finding the most wasteful and complex ways to bomb people in countries Americans can’t even point out on a map. People who had absolutely no chance of fighting back, but people just scary enough to convince the brain dead that we need even MORE imaginary future money to eradicate them. The plutocrats get to participate in their thievery now, but the tab for the cost of this future money is on the income taxes of every working class American. We all could’ve spent this on ourselves, for our general welfare, for the people who had to beg for their lives on GoFundMe, but we spent it on plutocrats who bombed foreigners.

Then we get to the other damning contradiction of the capitalist system, the way in which we slave away for all of these nickels and dimes and so-called “future money”. Here’s a system in which two different groups of people are trying to make all the money: you and your boss. If one makes more, the other makes less. The “profits” so to speak of a business can only go in the hands of one group of people, those who produce it, or those who thieve it. The eternal “tug of rope” between the worker and their capitalist boss. Just as the plutocrats have control over how we spend the nation’s “future money”, so too do they try to have a grip on the “profit” produced by their workers; and just like the “future money” of a nation, it’s not just theft, it’s wasted!

Give a capitalist fifty dollars and they’ll put it in an off-shore, tax-exempt bank account and then ask for more. Give a worker fifty dollars and it’s instantly recirculated into the economy. We cannot trust that a capitalist making more of the profits will make products cheaper or the capitalist more generous, they are hoarders by the nature of their role in this kind of society. A worker cannot afford to hoard in such a way, it’s spent on needs, it’s spread out, it’s recirculated. They have no reason for the nonsensical idea of keeping money they never intend to use. 

The consumer contradictions hurt the consumer, and the workplace contradictions hurt the worker. It is those who are not plutocrats that lose every time when the contradictions of capitalism are allowed to continue. A capitalist will not starve if their bottom line isn’t sky-high, but a worker will surely suffer if they miss even one paycheck. A capitalist will not sweat it if one less person buys their product, but a consumer will be left without their basic needs if not to be able to purchase it. 

For as long as the contradiction between the interests of centralized and decentralized wealth exists, the gains will always be upon the capitalists, and the losses upon the workers; the people. There is no amount of “regulation” or “competition” that makes these core contradictions any different. As long as they are allowed to exist, there is economic injustice in the world.",Liberal

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s\_Action\_Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party)

Positioned on the centre-right of Singaporean politics, the PAP is ideologically [socially conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism) and [economically liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism). The party generally favours [free-market economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market), having turned [Singapore's economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore) into one of the world's freest and most open,[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-15) but has at times engaged in [state interventionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism) reminiscent of [welfare capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_capitalism) policies. Socially, it supports [communitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_communitarianism) and [civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism), with the cohesion of the country's main ethnic groups of [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Singaporeans), [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Malay) and [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Indian) into a united [Singaporean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean) national identity forming many of its policies.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-16) On foreign policy, it favours maintaining a strong and robust military, serving as an indispensable guarantor of the country's continued independence with its strategic position for international [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_finance) and [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade).[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-MindefApr2005-18)

The [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) practised by the PAP during its first few decades in power was of a pragmatic kind as characterised by the party's rejection of [nationalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalisation). According to [Chan Heng Chee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Heng_Chee), by the late 1970s the intellectual credo of the government rested explicitly upon a philosophy of self-reliance, similar to the [rugged individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugged_individualism) of the [American brand of capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_model). Despite this, the PAP still claimed to be a [socialist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_party), pointing out its regulation of the private sector, activist intervention in the economy and social policies as evidence of this.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-69) In 1976, the PAP resigned from the [Socialist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International) after the [Dutch Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Netherlands)) had proposed to expel the party due to its shift in ideology.[\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-70)

In the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, [Singapore](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/singapore) ranks as the second most “economically free” country in the world just behind Hong Kong. Since many use this index as a shorthand for “most capitalist” countries, a lot of prominent people end up saying some really weird things about Singapore. For instance, in his Liberty Con remarks, Bryan Caplan claimed Singapore was one of the closest countries to the capitalist ideal.

It is true of course that Singapore has a market economy. But it’s also true that, in Singapore, the state owns a huge amount of the means of production. In fact, depending on how you count it, the Singaporean government probably owns more capital than any other developed country in the world after Norway.",Liberal

3. Let’s assume this is a concern. Wouldn’t we expect this to be confirmed by empirical data? If so, why is it that cooperatives have on average the same or larger numbers of employees and grow at about the same rates?

4. Vis a vis access to capital, I think this is really only a concern in North America.

So for conext: I (22f) recently left an abusive relationship where I was frequently SAed, and it's left me feeling like my only value as a human is sexual and that my body is just an object for horny men to stick their doodles in. 🙄 

I've been given an amazing opportunity for my art to be shown at my first ever exhibition! Yay! I really wanted my art to centre around empowerment and reclamation of my body. So I drew a nude self portrait of me as a fairy. I LOVE the drawing. In it I have huge butterfly wings and im holding a dagger like a bad ass. It makes my body look beautiful and powerful.
I haven't told anyone that the drawing is me. I don't want to tell anyone but a few close friends. 

So, I showed the sketch to my mum and my sister... and both of them made comments about the size of my fairy's tits. I have disproportionately large tits. Real huge knockers. Whatever. I'm used to them being sexualised, that's what got me in this mess to begin with. My mum even said ""don't you want someone to buy ur drawing? Do u think anyones going to want to hang this on their wall?"" 
And then when I told my sister what my mum said, I was like ""it's just a body. It's not like it's porn or anything."" And then my sister was like ""is it not porn?"" 🥲😑😭

I know that if my body was less curvy, if my ass and boobs were smaller, those comments wouldn't have been made. My fairy would just be a beautiful little free spirit and definitely NOT porn. THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS WAS TO SHOW HOW MY BODY ISNT SEXUAL. IT'S ART. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. fufksmsnruf.

I'm scared to put my art into the gallery. I'm scared of what people are going to say about my body, without even realising that it's mine. Am I just re-traumatising myself? Im GOING TO submit my art. I love it and the way it makes me feel. I WANT to say ""fuck anyone who sexualises it"". But it's hard and it's scary... 

I'm hoping for some words of wisdom. Has anyone else made art like this? How did people react and how did you handle it? 
If you were in this position, what would u do/say to urself so u can feel brave about this?

"How Can I Best Explain To My Mom The Ethical Problem With Billionaires?

I try to reiterate the notion that Bezos has accumulated such wealth through exploiting workers through terrible working conditions, violating workers safety, and underpaying for the service being provided. My mom would just respond to the effect that they choose to work there and Jeff just worked harder.

I particularly would love to best explain to her the problem with this thinking because she is a Black woman and I know there are a lot of people within the Black community who share this thinking but often the greatest victims of this capitalist structures are Black people. Just because Oprah and Jay Z are billionaires doesn’t mean you will too and it isn’t inherently evil to accumulate that much wealth nor is it feasible for you.

"War Criminals Rally Behind Hawk Clinton (/r/WorkersVanguard) https://archive.is/DWTWJ

Workers Vanguard No. 1094 26 August 2016

Capitalist Green Party No Alternative

We Need a Revolutionary Workers Party!

Coming off the Democratic National Convention—where retired four-star Marine general John Allen roused the party faithful into jingoistic chants of “USA! USA!”—Hillary Clinton has been racking up endorsements from a veritable rogues’ gallery of U.S. imperialism’s leading warmongers, mass murderers and Dr. Strangeloves. In early August, 50 former top national security advisors to Republican administrations going back to Richard Nixon signed a letter declaring that their party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, “would be the most reckless President in American history.” What moved them to jump ship was not Trump’s flagrant racism, a card the GOP has been playing for decades, albeit somewhat more sotto voce.

Rather, these Republicans lost it when Trump opined that he would not necessarily support the Baltic NATO states if Russia attacked. For more than a decade, the U.S. imperialists have been provoking capitalist Russia, including through a military buildup of NATO forces on its borders. Now the Democrats and many Republicans are seizing on Trump’s stated affinity for Vladimir Putin to portray him as a Manchurian candidate, a puppet for the Russian president. In a 5 August New York Times op-ed piece titled “I Ran the C.I.A. Now I’m Endorsing Hillary Clinton,” Michael Morell, former acting director of the CIA, put it baldly: “In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”

In contrast, Morell promotes Clinton’s qualifications to be Commander-in-Chief of U.S. imperialism. He points to her role as an “early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice” (i.e., murdered him and threw his body into the sea) and a consistent promoter of a “more aggressive approach” in Syria (i.e., bomb ’em back to the Stone Age). He salutes her willingness to “use force” and “her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all—whether to put young American women and men in harm’s way.” No wonder that she has for months been getting the support of several leading neocons who worry that Trump is an “unreliable” loose cannon. In short, Clinton is a proven, gold-plated war hawk.

Donald Trump is a dangerous demagogue, capable of saying and doing just about anything. And there is plenty for working people and the oppressed to fear as he incites a frenzy of “America First” chauvinist reaction among his supporters, who include the race-terrorists of the KKK and other fascists. It is this fear that the Democrats have cynically played on to get black people, immigrants, workers and the now-dejected youthful followers of Bernie Sanders to rally behind Clinton.

In the Democratic primaries, 77 percent of the black vote went to Clinton. Overwhelmingly, black people see the former party of the Confederacy and the Jim Crow South as the only option to defeat Trump. It was heartbreaking to see the mothers of Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and others killed at the hands of the cops or racist vigilantes on stage at the Democratic Convention for the coronation of a woman who reviled young black men as “superpredators” and backed her husband’s racist anti-crime bill and the destruction of welfare.

As always the labor misleaders offered their services, with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka also taking the stage to push the whopping lie that Clinton will “protect workplace rights” and “stand up to Wall Street.” The union tops’ allegiance to the Democrats is an old shell game. Their subordination of the interests of the working class to the party of their exploiters has left a trail of broken strikes, busted unions and the ongoing destruction of the livelihood of working people.

Meanwhile, as she tries to court Republicans, Clinton’s attentions are directed not to the traditional base of the Democrats but to wooing Wall Street and the generals, spies and other operatives of U.S. imperialism into her “big tent.” And she has been very successful. As Black Agenda Report editor Glen Ford wrote in “Hillary Stuffs Entire U.S. Ruling Class into Her Big, Nasty Tent” (10 August):

“It’s a funky place to be—especially for the traditional Black, brown and labor ‘base’ of the party, now squished into a remote and malodorous corner of the tent, near the latrine, clutching the pages of a party platform that was never meant to bind anyone....

“She is the candidate of the imperial war machine, whose operatives have flocked to her corner in dread of Trump’s willingness to make ‘deals’ with the Russians and Chinese. She is the candidate of multinational corporations, which are perfectly confident she is lying about her stance on TPP and other trade deals. And she is the candidate of the CIA and its fellow global outlaws, who will thrive as never before with a president in the White House who cackles ‘We came, we saw, he died’ when the leader of an African country is murdered by Islamic jihadists supported by the United States.”

If elected, Clinton will have her trigger-happy fingers on the nuclear button. For his part, Ford, like other radical liberals, not to mention a cast of self-proclaimed socialists, looks for refuge in the capitalist Green Party.

From Bernie Sanders to the Greens

Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin succinctly explained that the fraud of bourgeois democracy amounts to deciding “once every few years which member of the ruling class is to repress and crush the people.” In this contest between perhaps the two most despised candidates in U.S. history, we aim to drive home the Marxist understanding of the class nature of the capitalist order, and the need to build a multiracial revolutionary workers party independent of and in opposition to the rule of the capitalist class enemy and all its parties.

In contrast, organizations like Socialist Alternative (SAlt) and the International Socialist Organization (ISO), notwithstanding their rare genuflections to Marxism, are busy trying to pump some air into the deflated tire of bourgeois electoralism by channeling discontent into support for the Green Party’s presidential candidate, Jill Stein. Having spent the last year rallying behind Bernie Sanders and his calls for a “political revolution against the billionaire class,” SAlt wailed that Sanders “walked out on that strategy, and called for a vote for the very establishment we have been fighting against.” In fact, he did exactly what he promised when he launched his campaign: to back the winner of the Democratic primaries. As we wrote in “Break with the Capitalist Democrats and Republicans!” (WV No. 1092, 1 July):

“Many of those who support Sanders believe that his primary bid has launched a ‘movement’ that represents some kind of challenge to the political establishment. In fact, Sanders has done everything to reinforce this establishment by refurbishing its image and reinforcing illusions and confidence in American capitalist democracy. He brought large numbers of disaffected young people ‘into the political process’ (read: Democratic Party)....

“To put it plainly: the pseudo-socialist groups that support Sanders have done their best, within the limits of their forces, to reinforce the ties that bind the working class politically to its class enemies. As revolutionary Marxists, we offer no political support on principle to any party of the bosses—not only the major parties of the U.S. ruling class, the Republicans and Democrats, but also small-time capitalist parties such as the Greens.”

Having led many youth and others down the garden path with Sanders, SAlt is now trying to corral them behind Stein’s campaign as “the clear continuation of our political revolution.” Kshama Sawant, SAlt’s Seattle city council member, argues that Stein “has gone further than Bernie, in particular with her rejection of key aspects of U.S. foreign policy.” That wouldn’t be hard. Sanders argues that the U.S. “should have the strongest military in the world” and has an impeccable record of support to the wars, occupations, drone strikes and other depredations of U.S. imperialism (see “Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog,” WV No. 1083, 12 February).

And what is the position of Stein’s Green Party? Her election platform calls for cutting in half the U.S. military budget, which is many times more than the combined total of all its imperialist rivals. So Stein is for fewer bombs than Bernie and Hillary but is nonetheless dedicated to preserving an arsenal to enforce the predatory and murderous interests of America’s rulers abroad.

Stein’s program calls to “restore the National Guard as the centerpiece of our defense.” You know, the National Guard that occupied Ferguson to put down protests against the cop killing of Michael Brown in 2014; the National Guard that union-busting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker had on standby to do the same against black protests in Milwaukee; the National Guard that shot dead four antiwar protesters at Kent State in 1970 after being called in from a nearby deployment against a Teamsters strike; the National Guard that, as the domestic troops enforcing the diktats of America’s capitalist rulers, has the blood of countless striking workers on its hands.

For its part, the ISO has also, and yet again, thrown its support to the Green Party. In particular, the ISO is enthused over “the passage of an amendment to the party platform making the Greens an explicitly anti-capitalist party.” Why would that make any difference to the ISO? They supported the Green Party and even ran their own members as candidates of the party when the Greens openly described themselves as a party of “small business, responsible stakeholder capitalism.” Despite the Green Party’s current proclaimed rejection of the “capitalist system,” the amendment to its program doesn’t change its character as a bourgeois party and is, in fact, “balanced” by also rejecting “state socialism,” raising the all-purpose anti-communist bogeyman of totalitarianism.

The Greens’ vision is of “an economy based on large-scale green public works, municipalization, and workplace and community democracy.” Such a Shangri-La is a pipe dream conjured up by relatively well-heeled and overwhelmingly white middle-class people who live in advanced capitalist countries and have their homes in neighborhoods far removed from the industry required for a modern economy. They are the types that have access to resources for “local sustainability,” with vegetable plots, bike paths and a city council that will raise taxes on such unhealthy habits as smoking and sugary sodas, depriving the poor and working class of some of the few pleasures they have in life.

Stein also says she stands for beneficial things like free Medicare for all, a living wage, jobs for the unemployed, free education through university, etc. But these promises—which in themselves would only provide limited relief from the all-sided destitution faced by working people and the poor—are hot air. Such concessions will only be wrung from the bourgeoisie through class struggle, mobilizing the social power of the working class whose labor produces the wealth that is stolen by the capitalist exploiters.

For working people to get their hands on that wealth, the capitalists’ power has to be broken. That means a workers party that fights for a workers government to expropriate the capitalist owners and expand the productive forces in order to create an egalitarian socialist society, one devoted to providing for the needs of the many, not the profits of the few. This is counterposed to the program of the Green Party, which is devoted not to increasing but to decreasing production and consumption—purportedly to “save the earth,” not its human inhabitants.

The Third Party Fraud

There have been several third-party candidacies in the history of the U.S. From Robert La Follette’s 1924 presidential bid to Henry Wallace’s 1948 Progressive Party, their purpose has been to corral discontent with the two major parties into another capitalist electoral vehicle with promises of a better deal for the “little guy.” In its call to “Fix Our Broken System,” the Green Party promotes the value of third parties to not only “lure voters to the polls” but “also help to turn one of the major parties out of office.” As an example, they point to Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, whose 1912 election campaign “helped the Democrats wrest the White House from 20 years of unchallenged Republican supremacy.” The winner was Southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson, an arch-segregationist who drove blacks out of federal civil service jobs and was an admirer of the Ku Klux Klan.

Similarly, the Green Party’s statement argues that third parties keep “Americans involved in our democratic process” by providing “an ‘emotional bridge’ for voters who are weary of supporting one major party but are not yet ready to vote for the other.” Here they grotesquely hold up the 1968 presidential campaign of George Wallace. “Segregation forever” Wallace was the former Dixiecrat governor of Alabama who revolted against civil rights legislation. According to the Greens, his American Independent Party campaign “drew support from traditional Southern Democrats who weren’t emotionally prepared to vote as Republicans.” The Southern Democrats crossed that “emotional bridge” and are now a major component of the racist yahoos rallying for Trump.

And it’s not just them. Last summer, former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader heralded Trump as a “breath of fresh air.” Welcoming Trump’s then-refusal to rule out a third party challenge if he lost the GOP nomination, Nader argued: “The two party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it.” Wow—the ticket to breaking the domination of big business is a billionaire real estate mogul!

To all those who bought Sanders’ phony “political revolution,” don’t get fooled again by Stein’s Green Party. The facade of bourgeois democracy is designed to obscure the fact that the capitalist state is an instrument of organized force and violence, consisting at its core of the police, army, courts and prisons. Its purpose is to maintain capitalist rule and profit through the suppression of the working class, the forcible segregation of the majority of black people at the bottom of society and by advancing the interests of U.S. imperialism abroad.

It is a myth that working people and the oppressed can elect a reformed capitalist government that will defend their interests against the robber barons of Wall Street. As communists, we champion the fight for jobs for all at good wages; for decent housing; for quality, fully government-funded health care and education. Our purpose is to link such demands to building a revolutionary working-class party that will inscribe on its banner the defense of immigrant rights and the fight for black freedom as part of the struggle to overthrow this decaying capitalist system. As the Spartacist League/U.S. Declaration of Principles, written at our founding 50 years ago, states:

“The victory of the proletariat on a world scale would place unimagined material abundance at the service of human needs, lay the basis for the elimination of social classes, and eliminate forever the drive for war inherent in the world economic system of capitalism. For the first time mankind will grasp the reins of history and control its own creation, society, resulting in an undreamed-of emancipation of human potential, the limitless expansion of freedom in every area, and a monumental forward surge of civilization. Only then will it be possible to realize the free development of each individual as the condition for the free development of all.”

"Does non-misogynistic pornography still reproduce misogyny in a patriarchal society? I define non-misogynistic pornography as porn without overt misogynistic themes (like violence against women, degrading name-calling, and so on). My question is, even if this type of porn doesn't contain misogyny, if it exists inside of a patriarchal cultural context, can it still reproduce misogynistic ideas in the minds of men who view it? (For example, if it is viewed by men who objectify women, could it strengthen their objectification, even if it just depicts normal sex?) And if this does happen, would this mean that all pornography, regardless of content, is harmful in a patriarchal context?

What has beem more attractive to me is anarchism: the belief that hierarchy ought to be abolished (this includes capitalism and the state).

Anarchy, kinda obviously, doesn't really have a history of authoritarianism (cause again, opposed to the state and power hierarchies). I think many of us are even sympathetic to a lot of anarchist criticisms of capitalism (business buying politicians, etc). 

I outlined personal criticisms in a recent post, but I'd like to hear what you guys think.

Personally I think the biggest problem with anarchism is scalability and dispute resolution mechanisms 

So say we have three communes on a river. Commune A is upstream Commune B which is upstream Commune C. A&B both have factories that pollute the river. Obviously A benefits the most cause their incoming water isn't polluted. B is second hurt and C is the most hurt. Obviously B doesn't like what A is going and complains. A doesn't really have to listen but B threatens to send it's members to sabatoge A's factory (I have seen anarchists propose this is a solution, so I am not making this up). C threatens to do the same to A & B. Now A & B share a common enemy, C. Why wouldn't they team up as C poses a mutual threat (historically this is how alliances actually work, they are not based on if you like your ally but if you hate the same people). Even if every commune had equal resources and population (which would very much not be the case), C is now outnumbered and outgunned. What exactly is it gonna do?

B And A have their differences sure, but that's sorted out after C.


Perhaps some third party arbitrator, commune D could step in to arbitrate. But this isn't really binding, and if they rule against a & b they may comply, but they are still incentived to cheat and undermine the ruling or straight up ignore it. Sure reputations are on the line, but reputational damage is just a cost. Countries and companies do shit like this all the time.  What is C gonna do? Retaliate? Sure, but A & B can just retaliate back no?

See what I am getting at? If you share a common resource you need enforceable rules. And to do that requires some form of authority/central governance. What form that should take is the real discussion no?

"Many Different Exploitations, Ideals And Fates Of Femininities: From Patriarchal Capitalisms To Lesbian Eco-Feminisms And Everything In-Between Image available at: https://postimg.cc/XZwRR7Xk

I dedicate this text to my parents, thanking them for being my support system ever since I was born.

Have you ever heard or read somewhere a phrase like that: ""behind a great man is always a great woman""?

Because behind a great woman, usually, is also a great woman, perhaps her motherly figure, her girlfriend or wife, her daughter, her grandma, and or her maid.

First of all, just to make things clear, I was only able to write this text venting because of how lucky I am that I was able to dedicate the majority of my time to my education studying, because I can rely upon my mom to do domestic chores and upon my present dad as a ""breadwinner"", that's to say that I recognize how lucky and privileged I am of having a support system, what many feminine people lack, although they can find support with one another, and that is what usually happens, specially in the case of many feminine people who achieved success in life as ""breadwinners"".  

Approaching, through the lens of afro-feminisms, inside this rather minoritary group of feminine people who achieved success in life as ""breadwinners"", many of them are white women who have had the lucky and privilege to have in their lives another feminine person in a supporting role as their support system that they could count on, and usually, that's a domestic maid, specially an woman of color or foreign woman, that, usually, due to lack of higher degrees of education face less opportunities in life for them and end up having to take on those supporting roles.

This isn't anything new in history other than an inheritance from the times of slavery and colonization, ever since dating back to those times, women of color had to sacrifice investing focus and time into their domestic, personal and family lives to take care of the lives and children of white women for these women focus on achieving their own personal success, while the families and children of women of color, usually, were left deprived of attention and care out there in the world if not on their own and forced to mature faster than their whither and richer peers, specially when it comes to so called ""third world"" countries.

Curiously, since those maids spend more time with the kids of those, usually, whither women from higher classes than them, they know better about kids that are not theirs than of about their own kids, usually having to take on motherly roles to raise children that are not even theirs and that, usually, are known lesser by their own mothers, who have little time for them, because they are busy investing their time and energy working, because, paraphrasing the philosopher Karl Marx, ""we must work to live, and live to work"" in the capitalist patriarchal way of organizing and (re)producing human existence and living life model we currently live in as a society.

If you don't believe what I have said so far, I highly recommend watching this very short ""YouTube"" video entitled ""Who Knows Kids Better? Mums Vs Maids | Inspirational Video"" in the channel called ""Heart Touching Films"", which you can check out in the following link: https://youtu.be/8oME-ar9WpI

In a video in the ""YouTube"" channel of Kristen Leo entitled ""The Collapse Of Hetero Relationships"", which you can check out in the following link: https://youtu.be/ioRCGlQ30Ec, recommends that everybody is better off living with their parents if they have the appropriate environment or conditions to do so, that way, maids wouldn't be necessary to take care of the domestic lives of other feminine people, but ultimately that doesn't solve their issues, because the maids would still need other ways to work to produce their future existence and survive while also providing to who they care for, so they would end up just looking for other jobs if that were the case and still leaving their own families out of affection and proper care, that's to say that the maids have no other choices, they are not guilty for all of that, the condition of their families and lives is ultimately a product of the ways of (re)producing existence in the society they live in, on the contrary, those maids that hold together not only their lives but both the lives of their families and those of other families are very admirable women in their strengths.

Perhaps, the best way out for those maids come from recommendations proposed when taking the lens of afro-feminims into consideration, that's to say that, ultimately, if only the maids were paid by the governments, like housewives in countries like Argentina already are thanks to feminisms, for spending all their time and efforts taking care of their domestic lives and families while raising their children with a better education that could pay off improving the future of society, what could impact everyone positively, would definitely be the best way out, as far as I am aware.


But what happens when this figure of the subserviant woman in a supporting ""secondary character"" role in her own life is not present in the life of another woman?

Anyway, in the capitalist patriarchal sociocultural model of organizing and (re)producing human existence and dividing gender roles and expectations, somebody has to take care of the domestic chores, usually considered feminine, in order for another person achieve success while ""working to live, and living to work"", again paraphrasing Karl Marx when he criticized such models of organizing and producing existence, rather unsustainable models since they end depending upon a whole variety of kinds of exploitation of different kinds of femininities, and, ultimately, the exploitation not only of human resources but the resources from MOTHER nature in general, also known as the very first and most exploited lady of them all through history.


Off course none of those are not the only definite model for the way of organizing and living your life, besides those, out there is also the women who does both the sociocultural gender roles imposed, expected and forced upon women/mothers and men/fathers, she basically carries the whole responsibility of holding together the lives of those she cares about on her own back.


Although this alternate, rather androgynously genderqueer and anglospheric, ideal of femininity is as much of an empowered warrior as also are the lesbian eco-feminists, she usually ends up having to ""wear both the pants and aprons"" in her relationships with disproportionate heteronormative dynamics of gender role divisions and expectations, having to ""parent"" her kids and usually rather immature boyfriends or husbands that can exploit their empowered skills and strengths, that if they have a boyfriend or husband to begin with, otherwise they have to play both ""motherly"" and ""fatherly"" roles for their children, what scares men away, usually.

Perhaps, the character called ""Nicole"" in the cartoon called ""The Amazing World Of Gumball"", who is the mother of the titular character, ""Gumball"", is the best example of such alternative rather androgynous ideal of femininity, since the show usually pulls out of her jokes, that come across to me as more of social satire than mean-spirited, about her breaking down in anger due to her ""short fuse"" because the of all the pressure put upon her for having to carry by her own back all the responsibilities of keeping together the lives of those she cares about, while not having to only parent her children but also parent her immature lazy husband that she loves deeply regardless of all that anyway.

But what happens when a man is not present in the life of a woman?

Well, there is also the jealously that some hetero women have over lesbian and aromantic asexual women being able to picture and find their happiness without men in their lives, specially when talking, for example, about alternative ideals of (organizing and producing their) existence, specially lesbian eco-feminisms, which are about escaping the patriarchies and capitalisms towards living independent, as in sustainable and self-sufficient, minimalist lives in a rural commune, without men and money, living off subsistence vegan agriculture, sharing and trading while embracing all of nature, inclusive your queer feminine nature shamelessly, independently and sustainably, an ideal utopian romantic rural fantasy setting, to say the least.

I am sorry if I came across as ""harsh"" because of my rather ""acid"" sense of humor, when trying to break down what lesbian eco-feminisms are about into a nutshell, while comparing two different ideals of femininity inherent to two different ideals of organizing existence and living:

https://www.reddit.com/user/DoNotTouchMeImScared/comments/rbdgud/unsustainable_patriarchal_capitalisms_x/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Both of them are technically housewives, their differences revolve around them being very different ideals of femininity inherent to two different, rather white eurocentric, ideals of organizing and producing existence and living: the housewife in the left side of the image is an rather retrograde ideal of femininity attached to very conservative worldviews and values, while, on the other hand, the housewife on the right side of the image is a rather androgynously genderqueer ideal of femininity attached to very progressive worldviews and values.

I'm not gonna lie, but the ""cottagecore"" ideals and aesthethics may often come across as just an white eurocentric ideal of femininity rebranded towards sapphic and ambientalist women when linked to embracing a rather fantastical and romanticized version of nature, so to say, ""cottagecore witches"" are just housewives but gay and hippie.


In this another post about the same topics I made a few days ago, a lot of comments made by heteropesimist/heterofatalist feminist women, who in their hopelessness, were resentful and jealous of such alternative ideal socio-environmentalist feminist romantic rural fantasy setting of lesbian eco-feminisms which sapphics can dream of and aspire as a direction towards in their lives as an alternative possibility of existence, were deleted:

https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/ra6o9f/dont_we_all_dream_of_that_then_we_gotta_unite_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


Before this week, never would I have ever thought that someday I would have to deffend hetero marriage against heteropesimist/heterofatalist women, while also defending feminisms and (gender)queerness against environmentalists.

If you have no idea what heteropesimism or heterofatalism is about and want to understand better the feelings of hopelessness of hetero women who believe they are doomed to a fate of pain because they also believe that ultimately there is no way out nor hope in living (love) lives fred from exploitations, I highly recommend giving this other text i wrote another day about the topic a read: https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/r9zflf/heteronormative_and_homonormative_relationship/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I cannot entirely understand how painful that must be to face being forced so ""bitterly"" to ""wake up"" from the dreams of a fairytale romantic ""happily ever after"" fantasy with a charming prince you have grown up with, dreamed of and aspired towards for so long as a meaningful direction for your life.

I am not gonna lie, due to feeling like that, I often end up idealizing and daydreaming about and finding so appealing the lesbian eco-feminist model of existence as an alternative to the capitalist cis-heterero-normative patriarchal model of existence I live with that keeps bringing me more and more pain through the years.",Liberal

"Flipped Script: An experiment in telling men to smile the same way they often tell women to, as if they were entitled to smiling women I hope this is not in violation of the rules. 

So when I saw a post last week about a woman sick of being told to smile, it inspired me.  I've seen the type of complaint before, but this one made me realize exactly how pernicious it was.  I decided to try it on men, and especially those who told a woman too. The results were amusing, and a couple of stories worth telling so I thought I would share.

I'm a 41 year old overweight male, which I feel is important for the context of the reactions I got.  I consider myself feminist, and read several women's subreddits so i can better understand issues i am not directly affected by, because i can better speak out when i see issues when i am more aware of them.  

First, I counted a total of 104 men I told to smile. Of those

23 ignored me completely

31 Actually smiled (plus 4 who laughed)

18 gave me strange looks but otherwise did not react

29 got varying degrees of offended (16 of whom called me gay)

2 threatened me with violence

1 threatened me with sexual harassment

Of special note, those who I told to smile after they told a woman to were FAR more likely to fall into the offended category than the actual smile category. Be aware none of these men did I react instantly to tell them to smile, but waited a few minutes to let their incident be ""cold"".

Three stories are really worth sharing.

The first happened on day 2 of the experiment. As part of one of my cases was a zoom call with a judge and the opposing council. Before the session was called, the opposing lawyer told my client they should smile instead of scowl (she wasn't scowling, she was just waiting nervously). She ignored him and I said nothing as the court was called into session. During the first recess, at the end as we were returning but before it was called back into session, I told him ""You should smile more when you talk, you are more handsome that way"". He went purple and told me it was ""wildly inappropriate to talk to him like that"". I asked him why he thought it was ok for him to speak to my client that way then. The judge said nothing, but she did chuckle before starting the session. I'm certain she has had her share of the problem too.

Second story was the threat of sexual harassment. This was in a grocery store. The man told the clerk she needed to smile as she started ringing him up. I waited till she was done, and as he was gathering the last of his bags, I told him his face would be more attractive if he smiled. He got MAD. And threatened to sue me for ""sexual harassment"". I pointed out that since we had no work relationship, he couldn't, but what he did to the young woman WAS harassment. He yelled again (wish i had written down what) then left before the scene got any further.

The last story worth telling was the good one with a better ending. This time a contractor doing some work in the building, told one of our aides the smile. So later that day, made an excuse to pass by where he was working and told him to smile. His first reaction was to be offended. But then he actually caught himself and said ""wait, is this because i said it to the girl earlier"". I nodded, and that was the end of it. Now I don't know if the question to him was a moment of self awareness about how uncomfortable it was, or just thinking I was getting revenge and he brushed it off, but I'd like to think the former? Maybe?

Anyway, I don't really have a point just thought I'd share this hoping you all found it as amusing as I did.

I wish i had kept better numbers how many of these were after they told a woman to smile, vs just told to smile and exact numbers on the difference.",Liberal

 I mean no disrespect or trolling at all, this is a genuine curiosity that I have.

"Parallel post for previous post. The hatred for china and neo cold war red scare ideology behind it. China giving people homes is good actually. So i made a post from the instagram post known as Soapbox.

https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/swcw9i/lanlords_are_leeches/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

 Follow them they are good. A left wing big media page that is easy to share and change minds. Or get conversations going. I added red sun in the sky at the end as a joke. The joke was that maos land reform campaign called for the peasants to kill their landlord.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Reform_Movement_(China)#:~:text=The%20campaign%20involved%20the%20mass,land%20redistribution%20to%20the%20peasantry.

This is an objective good thing. They got rid of the landlords and people did not have to pay rent anymore. People who lived on the farms and people who lived in the houses owned those houses. Thats why china has a high homeownership rate.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546956/#:~:text=Today%20China%20is%20a%20country,et%20al.%2C%202020).

In fact many ex communist states despite a rise in homelessness have higher homeownership rates than much of the west

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

This is a good thing. China has very little homelessness. Communist china. A country that plans its economy using state owned enterprises. They got rid og the rich oppressors. And now china has subsidized cheap housing program. Meaning that even if you rent. Its at a fixed rate and its cheap. They regulate the market which is why recessions are almost non existent.

Yes china is not perfect. China just lets hong kong people in misery. 58 percent of people are poor. The wealthy live lavishly and china does not provide unions for parts of the capitalist economy. Racial issues and allowing capitalists to run policy in the party.

But there is nuance. Why cant we talk about the stregnth of these nations. This is the issue of the western left. My previous posts highlight that the western left will not support actually existing socialist countries cause 1. They are not ideologically pure and do some bad shit socially or economically. And they lack nuance or view these countries as scary villains. This is all a ploy of the neo cold war and yall are feeding it

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Cold_War

The lefts lack of support manufactures consent for our countries to do warfare against china. Remember trumps trade wars.

They failed of course because almost all corporations manufacture in china. So if yoy put a tariff on chinese goods its essentially a tariff on the usa. Increasing a deficit.

And no one really batted an eye. China is strong. But is dprk. Vietnam. Laos. Cuba. Venezuela. Bolivia strong enouguh to deal with sanctions. Embargoes. Tarriffs? Today it was taxes on china. Next its arming a fascist group to coup the cpc. Everytime i say critical support for china people scream as if i said lets support hitler.

The black panthers supported maos china. Kim il sung. Ho chi minh. Fidel. Khrushchev. Socialists in africa. Etc. They had an internationalist approach. Anf thats what we need. Anti imperialism. ""But chinas imperialist"". China doesnt force countries to trade with it. Or get loans. The usa and IMF do. They say if you dont do it pur way we will coup you like bolivia and Venezuela. And when you take a loan you will make unions illegal and lower the minimum wage and liberalize everything. And thats what africa had to do. The west enslaved and colonized Africa. Then asked them to pay colonial tax and allow the west to use their labor force. While the loans are expensive for china they are better than the usa. Its mutual agreement. More cpuntries are willingly joining the belt and road.

All in all how can we be like china bad. When we have 67 percent homeownership and homelessness is on the rise. Housing prices are on the rise. This chuckle fuck that was that land lord are why people cant live. 37 percebt of paycheck goes into housing. Why is china seen as bad when it provides housing for its people. It provides jobs. And food and healthcare and education for its people. 

I support china. Im critical but no one in good faith can say that this is bad actually. Mao killing landlords and giving people houses is bad actually. Think critically. Look at the uk and usa. Do they have housing for people.

Dont feed into the neo cold war. Have nuanced critical Support for internationalist socialist countries. Especially china the internationalist red sun in the sky.

"Democratic Socialism vs Socialism There are many different definitions of *socialism* and *democratic socialism* out there. Many experts seem to disagree on certain definitions. On the Communist Manifesto, Marx refers to the terms *Communism* and *Socialism* interchangeably.

Some people view *Socialism* as a **diluted Communism**.

Some people view *Socialism* as a **transitionary state** **with** ***Communism*** **as an end goal**.

&#x200B;

When we get into the gist of socialism, we of course refer mainly to the *proletariat* taking control of the [means of production and a planned economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialism.asp)**.**

What *communism* and *socialism* have in common would be:

\-The state being in control of the **means of production**

\-A **planned economy**

From some views, the differences between *communism* and *socialism* consists in:

\-There **still being** [**private property in socialism**](https://7esl.com/socialism-vs-communism/)

\-Small businesses could still operate (local stores)

&#x200B;

From what I seem to understand, the [differences between socialism and democratic socialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcAQB3oPzt0) are as follows:

\-Democratic socialists **reject** the Marxist-Leninist concept of **planned economy**

\-Democratic socialists have ***some*** aspect of *capitalism* when it comes to *supply and demand*

\-Democratic socialists want to [**nationalize most key industries but not all**](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-socialism-and-democratic-socialism/)

\-Democratic socialists want **company decisions to be made by employees** [(workers' self-management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management)

\-Democratic socialists **do not want a one party state**, instead wanting a **full democracy with multiple parties**

"Where are these pro-Putin posts and commenters? I imagine that there are out there. After all, the left movement is vast and divergent across the globe. However, for all of the posts talking about this, I’ve not seen much of, if any of it all. I think there are a lot of people misconstruing anti-NATO and US imperial sentiments as being pro russian government and Putin rhetoric. Let’s be clear though, between adversarial bourgeois powers, there is no side to take but the peoples and protections of their own lives. I believe most people simply lack the rhetorical capabilities to fully explain their positions and therefore, to the outside observer claim that they are pro-Putin without considering the nuance. Not to mention, here in the US, where I reside, we are inundated with propaganda and seemingly baseless claims from “anonymous intelligence officials.” A faction of the US government we should never trust blindly, if at all. Therefore, many people on the left end spend much of their time condemning them, since it’s what we’re most familiar with and needs the most countering as our people become blind to any historical, geo-political, ideological, economic, and security reasonings from anywhere but the US governments.

Remember, condemn both, fight for neither, live for each other. War must be avoided at all costs, NATO must be condemned at every turn, and Putin must also be brought to heel. This isn’t a both sides sentiment as there are many more than two sides. May our hearts and minds be with the working people of Ukraine stuck in between two warmongering powers.

"Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism and Liberalism Hello fellow comrades and colleagues,

I had an interesting thought lately. A friend of mine recommended to me to more often read or even subscribe to *The Economist*. I bought a few issues of it and its articles on political matters were interesting (usually I read left-liberal papers like the *New York Times)*. As you might already know it is a wide ranging weekly newspaper with a focus on the political and financial world. While thinking about subscribing I read the Wikipedia entry on it and found something strange - their editorial line. Generally speaking they see themselves as **radically centrist** as well as liberal in their stance - a bit to the left in social matters, but in economic matters a bit more to the right (depending on who writes an article and the time).

This line ""radically centrist"" made me think ... and reflect. After some hours of forming a question I found one: **what is the connection of (predominantely) Classic European Liberalism with Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism?**

To answer this question, I'll explain the origins and connections of said ideologies. While knowing that I'll probably walk on thin ice here, I'd like for you to read it in its entirety and bring up criticism in an ordinary and respectable manner.

&#x200B;

**Back to the roots**

Usually, one of the classic punch lines against Social Democrats or Democratic Socialists is that they would not be liberal because of \[*insert random policy*\] or \[*insert random quote*\]. A thing that is happening more and more often in Europe and the Americas but nothing that would be new. Such ""assaults"" are as old as the workers movement itself.

It started with the liberal chain of revolutions in 1848. In said year, almost every country in Europe faced a revolution of at least moderate size. In some countries more successful (France), in others it failed or only achieved partial successes (Austria, Prussia). Their demands of more liberties and participation wasn't necessarily new, but in most of these countries it was despised - as it reminded too much of the French Revolution of 1789 which threw Europe into chaos.

The (classic) liberals of that time weren't new either - but were more popular than before. They were the opposition to the aristocratic or elitist conservatism/monarchism, with some monarchs siding with liberals in part. The introduction of parliaments gave said liberal groups more voice - and faced them with a dilemma. Most liberals were some lower, but mostly middle to higher class bourgeois citizens with some form of secured money source, living primarily in cities. They would stand in contrast to the masses of workers, farmers and day labourers concentrated in cities and the countryside. Only a few of those bourgeois liberals had a realistic view of the situation of the lower classes (mostly doctors and physicians) while the majority cared only for their own interests and only in part that the liberties they sought would be for everyone.

This dilemma - society vs. economy - would define liberals and its parties in the time of rapid industrialisation across great parts of Europe. Said dilemma led to a spark that originated in Germany. Ferdinand Lasalle, the founder of the ADAV (*Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein* \-  Universal German Workers Union, first SocDem party) originated from a bourgeois family and grew up in a liberal family. But reading Marx and Engels as well as his personal commitments showed him that the liberal parties don't fight enough for the masses of workers and farmers as well as those groups being enfringed by the top. So he turned to Socialism - as did more and more future leading Social Democrats. They were all disappointed by the lack of care by the liberals and their failures.

The dilemma would strike again - in the form of division. Again in Germany, the *Fortschrittspartei* (Progressive Party, a constitutional liberal party), the biggest liberal party in the German Parliaments, would split over a law regarding the indemnity for the state budget between 1861 and 1866 in Prussia. A lot of liberal voted with Bismarck which divided the party over time - leaving the more centrist/bit left-leaning Fortschrittspartei and the economy and nationally-orientated *Nationalliberale Partei* (National Liberal Party), founded in 1867.

While Germany wasn't the only nation with such a divinde within its liberals, it serves as a classic example. The *Fortschrittspartei* (which transformed into various parties in the Kaiserreich) was in opposition to Bismarck while the *Nationalliberalen* were in coalition with Bismarck and his conservatives for most of the time until 1918. This divide inside liberal parties exists worldwide to this day with most adhereing to at least one side - either left-liberal (aka social liberal) or right-liberal (aka national liberal or primarily economic liberal). Only in a few instances there would be united parties.

&#x200B;

**Rise of Social Democracy**

As mentioned before, a lot of disillusioned lower class bourgeios citizens, seeing the devastations and troubles of industrialisation, broke with Liberalism as an ideology and went to Socialism - mostly in form of Social Democracy. Alongside the workers they had one great goal that was best summed up by Axel Honneth in his book ""*Die Idee des Sozialismus*"" - the goal of social liberty for everyone. This might sound odd, but makes sense from the viewpoint of the time. Social Democracy, while being based out of Socialist principles, introduced a lot of liberal values and ideas into its movement from the start. Its leaders, partially coming from liberal parties, took their ideas with them - and enlarged their scale for a greater ammount of peoples. Essentially they mixed the ideas of Socialism and Liberalism, but applying for most if not all people. This divide inside liberal parties exists to this day with most adhereing to at least one side - either left-liberal (aka social liberal) or right-liberal (aka national liberal or primarily economic liberal).

This triggered a sort of either misunderstanding or cheap talking point by the liberal parties - saying that the goal of Social Democracy was the revolution of the proletariat. Which was correct for a long time as Marxist doctrine held firm in the party. Until a certain German entered the upper ranks of the workers movement to change it ... and create the biggest divide inside the movement itself.

&#x200B;

**Enter Eduard Bernstein**

Some of you might know my response to a fellow colleage of mine in regard to Bernstein ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/oph642/a\_response\_to\_the\_post\_eduard\_bernstein\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/oph642/a_response_to_the_post_eduard_bernstein_on/)) in which I dealt with the ideas behind this. In short: Karl Kautsky, more or less chief ideologue of the SPD and regarded as the successor of Marx, stayed true to Marxist Socialist principles with revolution if necessary at its head.

Bernstein on the other hand went the other route. Bernstein sought to fulfill Socialism and its goals via reform, entering the democratic system and achieving its goals over time rather than with a violent uprising. In this he wanted to both avoid a uncontrollable dictatorship and achieve a better democratic basis for change. The debate was hotly contested inside the SPD and even in most European SocDem parties at the time - but both wings, revolutionaries and reformists held together in their united parties, squabbling over time. And surprisingly - this brought a lot of success for most parties. With their forefront organisations (especially unions) they established themselves firmly in their nations and achieved first successes like voting rights for all citizens and lowered weekly work time.

But ... the split inside the party continued and came like the liberal one to a great divide. Which came with the First World War. Again in short: the divide between Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists and Communists.

&#x200B;

**Since 1918**

The mentioned split in the workers movement was unable to be repaired up to this day. The essential differences, like between Social Democrats and Liberals, were too great in dogmatic and ideologic matters. But, the interwar period showed the first cooperations with Liberals and Social Democrats. Most known are the Weimar Republic with the Weimar Government (SPD, DDP \[left-liberal\] and Zentrum \[catholics\]). The various United Front governments against fascism (France, Spain). But the deluges too ... liberals siding with radical nationalist elements (Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain).

Liberals were only a small part in the interwar period, which was mostly dominated by the fight nationalism/fascism vs. socialism. Again the divide would stick and both liberal spectrums would side with their ideolgically closer partners in some cases. Others would resist.

World War II brought back Liberalism and its ideas in a modern fashion. Dominated in mind mostly by classic Liberalism most parties would orientate themselves with other parties in coalitions or create party-internal wings. A well known example of different views would be the FDP, the successor party of the German Liberals. While in the beginning mostly right-liberal and in coalition with the CDU/CSU, they shifted in the late 1960s towards a more left-liberal leaning under Walter Scheel. This would lead to the 13 years of SPD-FDP governments under Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. The *Freiburger Thesen* (Theses of Freiburg) became the left-leaning party platform that a lot of FDP members adhered to - until 1982 and their sudden shift to hardcore economic liberalism once again. One example of the left-liberals in the FDP was Gerhart Baum, a champoin for social issues and personal rights.

&#x200B;

**Connections**

Some still argue that Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism can't be liberal because of their radical socialist foundation and goals. Theoretically yes, but they often forget who those goals would benefit. While a lot of liberal parties are known as bourgeois parties (for a good reason, as most interests and members are bourgeois), Social Democracy attracted a greater following from almost all levels of society. Walking a special line: a mix of Socialist and Liberal ideas in mind - thinking themselves and acting as the ""greater"" champions of liberties and rights for all.

The goals of Liberals being in general more personal rights, securing said liberties and preserving democracy. Adding to this came the different wings - either improved social spending/social programs on the left or more economic liberty on the right. The downfall of Kenyesianism and the rise of what is today known as Neoliberalism partially changed this balance. Social liberal parties diminished in part or united with Social Democrats while economic liberals became stronger with the shift in economic thinking. Even the social liberals often embraced neolib ideas as did some Social Democrats (Blair, Schröder, Klima).

Looking at the history and basis of both ideologies it is easy to see that Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism is in some way influenced by Liberalism - but not in the way Liberals would like to see or acknowledge.

While Liberals mostly care for the preservation and extension of personal rights and liberties in general, Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists try to achieve these things for the masses by introducing more egalitarian policies and supports for lower classes.

While Liberals mostly care for Liberalism in a manner of Negative Liberties (freedom from interference by other people/the state), Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists care for Negative as well as Positive Liberties (the possession of the capacity to act upon one's free will, or in Axel Honneths way ""social liberty""), trying to connect those two as best they can.

How Social Democracy/Democractic Socialism achieves these things is seen by Liberals as not liberal, because higher taxes etc. would impede their own view of ""being free from"", putting themselves in a small light. The way of great reform is in their view the wrong way as again it would impede on the Negative Liberties of all.

Theoretically they may be right, but are in truth wrong. One example is Vienna in the interwar period. Hugo Breitner, Social Democractic city councillor for finances, introduced the, by his critics after him named, *Breitnersteuern* (in easy being taxes on luxury products and services) as well as *Wohnbausteuern* (Housing taxes - a progressive tax on housing, mostly targeting the rich and financing the new Social Housing Projects known as *Gemeindebau*). While they impeded the Liberties of a minority through taxes, they accomplished Liberties for a greater group. Even the rich classes in Vienna saw what was done with their taxes and most accepted it.

Of course I ain't the one to say ""Eat the rich"" in a radical manner, but the example shows that Liberals often enough are stuck in their own bubble and agenda, not necessarily connecting with the greater masses or interests. Some seem to achieve this (Canadian Liberals), while others run on campaigns that are strange and partially misleading (FDP in 2021 for instance).

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

While the divides between Liberals and Socialists still exist, I would argue that Social Democracy in itself is a fusion of Liberal basic ideas (meaning Classic Liberal ideas, not necessarily radical Neolib ones) combined with Socialist basics and a greater outlook, with a goal of either achieving a fair and social society with strong positive and negative liberties for all on one side or the reformist way towards Democratic Socialism over a long time (securing said liberties too). In this I would like to break a lance for Austromarxism. While in theory it was radically Socialist/Marxist in its goals (achieving the majority to start a social revolution via the democratic route), it could be considered as one of the most radical liberal ideas ever thought of. Achieving social liberty for all via the democratic route, protecting and enhancing the rights of all.

A strange coincidence? I don't think so. Liberalism is more than the ideology of the Liberal parties (or those calling themselves Liberals), but the basic idea of it (being equal rights and liberties for all) is a foundation for the movement we adhere to - for which we work day and night - for **Liberty**, Justice, Solidarity for all, not the few!

"Thoughts on the green party? I feel like many of you are sorta left libertarian or libertarian socialist. Even those who aren't, I'd be curious to here your opinion.

I posted this in r/GreenParty, but I wanted to hear from you all as well


Hello,

My  politics derive from a fundamental anti-authoritarianism and pro  personal liberty/freedom perspective. However, liberty without equality  is impossible. Equality is a pre-requsite (this is however I differ from  right-libertarians which is what most americans think when they heard  the word).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Economics)

I  am a big support of worker owned firms and would like to see an economy  that consists of many well-established firms that are worker owned and  new startups that initially give extra to the entrepreneur that started  them (I have outlined this in other posts and my rationale, it is to solve an incentive issue with coops in the current market), but  eventually treats them like any other worker. Class distinctions would  shrink and we would have a society of upper-middle class to lower  wealthy, in short everyone would be relatively well off, and no worker  exploitation could occur. As firms are worker owned, automation needn't  be a job killer and we can enjoy the benefits of robots reducing our  work time and increasing efficiency and profits for everyone.

I  am also a georgist, I don't think land ownership really makes sense,  and is fundamentally illegitimate. Big support of a LVT which can be  used to fund things like Universal Health care (though I generally  prefer a public option over MFA), public housing, etc.

So  given all of that, would I fit in here? The green party speaks to many  concerns, particularly about the environment, which is good, but idk if I  belong here. I was orginally thinking about joining the libertarian  socialist caucus in the Libertarian party, but I feel like that party is  too dominated by right-libertarians for my liking (especially after their recent tweet about racism...)

Thoughts?

Thanks!",Liberal

"Free Markets In Social Democracies So this came to mind recently when I pondered on the “hybrid, mix market economies” of Social Democracies:

What is Capitalism like in the Nordic Regions? 

How does income class mobility work in these economies? 

Is it true that the rich in those countries are taxed really high? 

Do they liked being taxed that much? Do they despise it?

"no PLEASE GIVE THIS A THOUGHT NO THIS MIGHT SEEM REALLY OUT THERE , BUT GIVE IT A READ, i DID AND I WAS AMAZED HOW MUCH SENSE THIS GUY MAKES  [https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/03/09/how-capitalist-is-singapore-really/](https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/03/09/how-capitalist-is-singapore-really/)  

In the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, [Singapore](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/singapore) ranks as the second most “economically free” country in the world just behind Hong Kong. Since many use this index as a shorthand for “most capitalist” countries, a lot of prominent people end up saying some really weird things about Singapore. For instance, in his Liberty Con remarks, Bryan Caplan claimed Singapore was one of the closest countries to the capitalist ideal.

It is true of course that Singapore has a market economy. But it’s also true that, in Singapore, the state owns a huge amount of the means of production. In fact, depending on how you count it, the Singaporean government probably owns more capital than any other developed country in the world after Norway.

The Singaporean state [owns](https://books.google.com/books?id=UC2wCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=singapore+state+owns+land&source=bl&ots=iUqL7GyZTd&sig=fmeD-Q-5txks2RNalyglYEMxCl0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE5oydut7ZAhWSVt8KHYtwDhU4ChDoAQhDMAU#v=onepage&q=singapore%20state%20owns%20land&f=false) 90 percent of the country’s land. Remarkably, this level of ownership was not present from the beginning. In 1949, the state owned just 31 percent of the country’s land. It got up to 90 percent land ownership through [decades of forced sales](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6), or what people in the US call eminent domain.

The Singaporean state does not merely own the land. They directly develop it, especially for residential purposes. Over 80 percent of Singapore’s population [lives in](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us) housing constructed by the country’s public housing agency HDB. The Singaporean government claims that around 90 percent of people living in HDB units “own” their home. But the way it really works is that, when a new HDB unit is built, the government [sells](https://www.gov.sg/factually/content/do-hdb-flat-buyers-own-their-flat) a transferable 99-year lease for it. The value of that lease slowly declines as it approaches the 99-year mark, after which point the lease expires and possession of the HDB unit reverts back to the state. Thus, Singapore is a land where almost everyone is a long-term public housing tenant.

Then there are the state-owned enterprises, which they euphemistically call Government-linked Companies (GLCs). Through its sovereign wealth fund Temasek, the Singaporean government [owns](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/Portals/0/docs/FinalReport_SOE_1July2014.pdf) a large share (20% or more) of 20 companies (2012 figure). Together these companies make up 37% of the market capitalization of the Singaporean stock market. The state also owns a large share of 8 real estate investment trust (REIT) companies (2012 figure), which they call GLREITs. The value of the GLREITs make up 54% of the country’s total REIT market.

The sovereign wealth fund Temasek doesn’t just own domestic assets. It also is invested broadly throughout the world, especially in other Asian countries. In March of last year, Temasek [had](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/our-financials/portfolio-performance.html) a net portfolio value of S$275 billion, which is equal to around 62% of the [country’s annual GDP](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/browse-by-theme/national-accounts). To put this figure in more familiar terms, Temasek’s total holdings are equivalent to if the US government built a $12.4 trillion wealth fund.

Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t generally associate state ownership of the means of production with capitalism. One way to see whether libertarians or conservatives actually think Singapore’s system is uber-capitalistic is to imagine how they would respond to someone who ran a campaign in the US aimed at bringing the country up to the Singaporean ideal.

In this campaign, the candidate would say that the state should expropriate nearly all of the land in the country, build virtually all of the housing in the country, move almost everyone into public housing leaseholds, become the largest shareholder of more than a third of the country’s publicly-traded companies (weighted by market capitalization), and build out a sovereign wealth fund that holds tens of trillions of dollars of corporate assets. Would this campaign meet with a warm libertarian embrace or perhaps be derided as a bit socialistic?

The case of Singapore is more than just a funny gotcha to use against right-wingers. It actually raises an interesting question about what it is people care about when it comes to “capitalism” and “socialism.” Is capitalism primarily about markets or private ownership? Relatedly, is socialism primarily about ending markets or promoting collective ownership? Often these things are bundled together, but they are logically and practically separable. Singapore (and Norway, among others) shows that it is quite possible to collectively own the means of production while also using price systems to assist in the allocation of productive factors. This is what market socialists have been saying for a hundred years.

The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.

But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.

We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.

The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.

Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.

These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.

>**Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.**

>1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
>4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.
>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production.

When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.

In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

"Marx's analysis of the laws of capital and the share market crisis - By Nick Beams (Boston Indie) 17 February 2018 Marx's analysis of the laws of capital and the share market crisis By Nick Beams 17 February 2018

Down through the years one of the most persistent attacks on Karl Marx by the high priests of bourgeois economics--the ideological guardians of the profit system--has been his contention that, in the final analysis, capitalism depends on the impoverishment of the working class.

History, they maintain, has proven otherwise and refuted Marx. While there have been periods of crisis, and rapid and even prolonged falls in the living standards of the masses, in the long run the profit system has served to uplift them and will continue to do so into the indefinite future, whatever fluctuations it may undergo.

Moreover, there is no possible alternative because the market system is not a historically developed mode of production, which came into being at one point and is therefore destined to pass away like earlier modes of production before it, slavery and feudalism. Rather, it is rooted in the laws of nature itself and is necessary and therefore eternal. In other words, despite some imperfections, which may give rise to problems at certain points, all is really for the best in the best of all possible worlds.

In feudal times, the high priests of the Church, who played the key role in sustaining and sanctifying the ruling classes of their day, maintained that when crises arose this was not a product of the social system but an ""act of God,"" a punishment for the sins of man deriving from his fall.

While there have been enormous advances in social and political thought since then--a product of the Enlightenment and the vast advances in the scientific understanding--the modus operandi of the present day ""high priests"" of capitalist economy, the bourgeois economists and pundits, is not altogether different from their predecessors.

When confronted with economic crises and their persistence, they maintain that these are not a product of the inexorable workings of the capitalist system itself, but arise from ""market imperfections"" or some external, unforeseen or accidental event. That is, they proceed, as Marx put it, on the basis that so long as capitalism acts according to the textbooks--the modern day scriptures used to justify the present socio-economic order--crises are not endemic to the system.

The events of the past two weeks, with the largest fall in markets since the crisis of 2008, raising the spectre of an even bigger disaster than that of a decade ago, have provided a damning exposure of this entire ideological framework.

Before going into a deeper analysis of the underlying driving forces and the inherent and irresolvable contradictions of which these events are an expression, let us begin with one undeniable economic fact.

In the decade since the eruption of the global financial crisis of 2008, none of the underlying contradictions that exploded to the surface has been resolved. At the same time, the immediate and ongoing consequences of the breakdown have been the reduction of the living standards of billions of people, while creating unprecedented wealth for a capitalist oligarchy occupying the heights of society. Or as Marx put it, the accumulation of wealth at one pole, amid poverty, misery and degradation at the other.

Whatever the immediate outcome, the financial turmoil of the past days has established, as an undeniable reality, the continuing threat of a meltdown of the capitalist economy. It hangs like a sword of Damocles over the working masses of the world, destined to fall, if not in this crisis, then in others to come.

Moreover, one of the most striking features of the latest crisis, is that it was not sparked by the immediate threat of recession but by news that economic growth was enjoying an uptick--the best period of synchronised global growth since 2009, according to the International Monetary Fund. Most significantly, it was triggered by data showing that wages in the US experienced their largest annual rise since 2009.

Most of what passed for analysis in the bourgeois media did little better than the tweet forthcoming from the very limited intelligence of US President Donald Trump. He noted: ""In the 'old days,' when good news was reported the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!""

Trump's ""analysis"" omitted a central feature of the market rise over the past nine years. It has not taken place on the basis of ""good news"" but in a period of the lowest growth in any ""recovery"" in the post-World War II period. It has been sustained only by the continued inflow of ultra-cheap money from the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks.

Lawrence Summers, former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and now Harvard professor of economics, was slightly more insightful. ""This is not yet a major earthquake,"" he wrote. ""Whether it's an early tremor or a random fluctuation remains to be seen. I'm nervous and will stay nervous. [It is] far from clear that good growth and stable finance are compatible.""

Summers is at least vaguely aware that in the present situation there is something deeply troubling for the capitalist class for which he speaks. The very measures undertaken in response to the last crisis, supposedly aimed at restoring economic health and growth, may in fact have created the conditions for another financial disaster as growth begins to rise.

The tendency of the rate of profit to fall

To analyse the present situation, it is necessary to leave the sphere of bourgeois economics--based on the premise that there are no inherent and objective contradictions in the profit system--and probe its historical development on the basis of the laws of motion of the capitalist economy uncovered by Marx.

The ongoing turmoil in financial markets, beginning with the Wall Street crash of October 1987, must be analysed on the basis of one of the most important contradictions of the capitalist economy explained by Marx. That is the long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

This tendency was noted by the foremost representatives of English classical political economy--Adam Smith and David Ricardo--who preceded Marx in the period when the bourgeoisie was a rising and progressive class.

While Smith and Ricardo found the tendency of the rate of profit to fall deeply disturbing, especially the latter because of its implications for the long-term future of the capitalist economy, they were unable to give any scientific explanation for it. That was provided by Marx, beginning with his uncovering of the secret of surplus value.

While Smith and Ricardo had the notion that the origin of surplus value was the labour of the developing working class, its actual source always remained a mystery to Marx's predecessors. How was it possible, they cudgelled their brains, on the basis of the laws of commodity exchange in the market, where equivalents exchange for equivalents, for a surplus to arise and for this surplus to be appropriated by capital?

Marx's solution consisted in his probing of the most important commodity exchange in capitalist economy, that between capital and labour. He showed that the commodity which the worker sold to the capitalist was not, as had been previously maintained, his or her labour, but labour power, the capacity to work.

Like every other commodity in the market, labour power's value was determined by the value of the commodities needed to reproduce it--in this case, the value of the commodities needed to sustain the individual worker and his or her family to ensure the continued supply of wage workers.

Surplus value arose from the difference between the value created by the worker in the course of the working day through the production process, and the value of the commodity, labour power, that the worker sold to capital through the wage contract.

The raw materials and machinery used up in the production process did not add new value, but passed on to the final product the value they already embodied.

Yet the analysis was not yet complete. The rate of profit had to be explained. This rate was not determined at the level of the individual capitalist firm, but at the level of the capitalist economy as a whole. It was given by the ratio of the total surplus value extracted from the working class to the total capital outlaid--the expenditure on labour power plus the expenditure on the means of production, raw materials and machinery.

The tendency of the rate of profit to fall arose not from some external factor, Marx showed, but from a contradiction at the very heart of this process.

The development of capitalist production led to the expansion of the productive forces and the use of ever-larger amounts of raw materials and machinery in the production process. As a result, expenditure on materials and machinery tended to comprise an increasing proportion of the total capital laid out. But this increased expenditure on what Marx called constant capital, as opposed to the expenditure on labour power, or variable capital, did not give rise to additional or surplus value.

Because the rate of profit was determined by the ratio of total surplus value to the total mass of capital--constant and variable--employed, there was an inherent tendency for it to decline.

Now, as Marx clearly identified, there were countervailing factors. These included: the increased exploitation of the working class in order to widen the difference between the value of labour power and the value created by the worker in the course of the working day; the lowering of wages to below the value of labour power, enforced through the creation of unemployment and a surplus working population; the cheapening of the costs of raw materials and machinery, so reducing the total value of capital on which the rate of profit was calculated; and the expansion of foreign trade.

But while these countervailing factors lessened the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, and at times could operate very powerfully--even lifting the profit rate--the basic tendency continually reasserted itself.

Marx characterised the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the most important law of political economy, above all from an historical point of view. This was because, on the one hand, it drove capital to develop the productive forces in an attempt to overcome its effects, while, on the other, it was the source of the continually recurring crises that beset the capitalist mode of production.

Marx's critics and the end of the post-war boom

With the development of the post-war capitalist boom, extending from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, Marx's law, it was claimed, had been refuted by historical events. As had been seen in the case of the German revisionist Eduard Bernstein at the end of the 19th century, the attack on Marx's analysis came from those who claimed to be his followers, but insisted it needed to be revised and updated.

The assault on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall was at the centre of one of the most influential books of the late 1960s, Monopoly Capital, written by the ""independent"" Marxist economist Paul Sweezy in co-authorship with Paul Baran in the midst of the post-war boom.

Sweezy, the founder of the journal Monthly Review, had already cast considerable doubt on the validity of Marx's law in his first book, The Theory of Capitalist Development, published in 1941. He now maintained that Marx had developed the law under conditions of competition in the 19th century and that in 20th century monopoly capitalism it no longer applied, if it ever had.

Sweezy maintained that the key question confronting capital was not the insufficient extraction of surplus value relative to the ever-growing mass of capital--the issue to which Marx's law had pointed--but the reverse. Monopoly capital created an increased mass of surplus value that had to be continually ""absorbed.""

A key aspect of Sweezy's theory, flowing directly from his economic analysis, was that in the advanced capitalist countries, dominated by monopolies, the working class was no longer a revolutionary force. The vehicle for socialist revolution, he claimed, was now the masses in the so-called Third World countries, striving for national liberation.

Monopoly Capital is no longer widely read but it continues to exert an influence. David Harvey, for example, adheres to much of Sweezy's economic analysis, as well as his insistence on the non-revolutionary role of the working class.

However, as so often happens, Sweezy's ""refutation"" of Marx came right at the point when developments in the capitalist economy were confirming Marx's scientific insights. Earlier, Bernstein had maintained that the Marxist analysis of the inevitable breakdown of capitalism was rendered a fiction by the boom beginning in the late 1890s. The collapse of Bernstein's prognosis came just 14 years after its elaboration, with the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

In Sweezy's case, his refutation was almost instantaneous. The publication of Monopoly Capital in 1966 came at a point when profit rates in the advanced capitalist economies were starting to turn down. This led to mounting economic problems and the rise of class tensions that were soon to produce potentially revolutionary struggles by the working class from 1968 to 1975.

Starting with the May-June 1968 general strike in France, the largest and most extended in history, and including the 1969 hot autumn in Italy, the 1974 miners' strike that brought down the Tory government in Britain, the revolutionary situation in Chile (1970-73) and the upheavals in the US, to name just some of the events, world capitalism was shaken to its foundations.

With the direct collaboration of the Stalinist, social democratic and trade union apparatuses, which betrayed these struggles, the capitalist classes were able to bring the situation under control and maintain their rule.

However, the underlying economic problems of the US and other major capitalist economies, rooted in declining profit rates, remained. Having kept themselves in the saddle, the ruling classes undertook a massive offensive against the working class, coupled with restructuring the world economy.

The global counter-offensive was initiated in the US under Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who put in place a high-interest rate regime. Its purpose was two-fold: to wipe out unprofitable sections of industry and force a major industrial restructure, and eliminate the large industrial complexes that were the centres of militant working class struggles in an earlier period. The Volcker purge had vast global ramifications, leading in 1982-83 to the most serious global recession since the Great Depression.

The decade of the 1980s was characterised by major class battles, of which the mass sacking of US air traffic controllers in 1981 by Reagan and the state violence unleashed by the Thatcher Tory government against the British miners' strike in 1984-85 were two of the most prominent. The decade also saw a fundamental transformation in the role of the trade unions. From organisations that had fought for limited gains by the working class, they betrayed all of its struggles as they became the chief enforcers of the program of pro-market, capitalist restructuring.

The attack on the social position of the working class--aimed at increasing the extraction of surplus value to counter the fall in the rate of profit--was accompanied by a reorganisation of production, through downsizing and globalisation to take advantage of cheaper sources of labour.

The growth of financial speculation

Crucial to this restructuring was the freeing of financial capital from the restrictions and regulations that were set in place following the disastrous experiences of the 1930s. The growing operations of finance, through the issuing of so-called junk bonds and other measures, were central to hostile takeovers, downsizing and mergers and acquisitions that transformed the organisation of capitalist production.

At the same time, the pressure on profit rates, as Marx predicted, resulted in a turn by capital to operations in the financial markets and speculative ventures as a means of profit accumulation.

This process led to financial storms by the end of the 1980s, with the eruption of the savings and loans debacle and the October 1987 share market crash, in which the Dow plunged by more than 22 percent in a single day.

The response of the incoming Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, represented a major turning point. He committed the central bank to the provision of liquidity to the financial markets in what became known as the ""Greenspan put."" In effect, the Fed became the guarantor to the financial markets, reversing previous policy.

While the October 1987 crash was the most severe one-day fall in history--a position it retains to this day--it did not lead to a broader crisis in the economy as a whole.

This was because the onslaught against the working class in the US and the first wave of globalisation, marked by the transfer of large areas of industrial production to the cheaper-labour countries of East Asia, the ""Asian Tigers,"" was beginning to lift the rate of profit.

This was reinforced after 1991 with the liquidation of the Soviet Union and the consequent abandonment by countries such as India of their nationally-regulated development programs and the increasing turn to the free market.

China, which became a source of cheap labour production in the 1980s through the establishment of special economic zones, opened up still further. The Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 was the signal by the Chinese Communist Party regime that it stood ready, by whatever means necessary, to ensure the exploitation of the Chinese working class by global capital.

In the first period of the Clinton presidency, beginning in 1993, the US economy enjoyed rising profit rates as a result of the boost provided by the exploitation of cheaper labour, paid as little as one thirtieth of US wages.

However, the basic tendency identified by Marx began to reassert itself from around 1997, when the average US profit rate began to turn down. As a result, the accumulation of profits by financial means, which had grown by leaps and bounds in the 1990s, became increasingly vulnerable.

By 1996, Greenspan pointed to what he called ""irrational exuberance,"" expressed in the tendency of stock prices to become ever-more divorced from the real economy. This warning, however, came to nothing. Greenspan, responding to the dictates and demands of finance capital, turned more openly to the provision of cheap money for speculation.

The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 was a significant turning point. It produced a depression in South-East Asia equivalent in scope to that of the 1930s in the advanced capitalist countries, but Clinton dismissed it as a mere ""glitch"" on the road to globalisation.

That was followed by the 1998 collapse of the US investment fund Long Term Capital Management, which had to be wound up in an operation conducted by the New York Federal Reserve, lest its demise brought down the whole financial system.

The dot.com bubble was then getting under way as the Fed provided ever-cheaper money. And at the behest of the financial markets, the last remnants of the regulatory mechanisms controlling their predatory operations, put in place as a result of the 1930s depression, were scrapped with the Clinton administration's 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.

The 2001 collapse of Enron revealed the dubious practices and outright criminality that increasingly marked the speculative financial bubble. Enron had pioneered new accounting practices in which profit was decided in advance to meet market expectations and then the accounts were manipulated to show the desired result.

Following the collapse of the tech and dot.com bubble, finance capital turned to the development of new methods for speculative profit accumulation, again facilitated with cheap money from the Fed. It developed highly complex and arcane financial derivatives, centred on the sub-prime mortgage market, but extending well beyond it. Goldman Sachs, among others, was a key player. It issued new products that it knew would eventually fail, but made money in the meantime by financing both sides of the deals.

The 2008 global financial crisis

In April 2007, the then chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, dismissed the possibility that the growing signs of problems with sub-prime mortgages could impact the broader market because these products only amounted to a $50 billion operation.

However, when the crisis erupted, it engulfed the entire financial system, threatening to bring down the insurance giant AIG following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This was because the methods employed in the sub-prime market were not ""rogue"" activities but typical of the financial markets as a whole.

The response of the Fed and other central banks to the 2008 crisis marked another decisive turning point. No longer was it a question of stepping in to rescue a failed individual firm. Massive intervention was required to prop up the US and global financial system as a whole.

The lowering of interest rates to historic lows--in some cases to negative levels--and the injection of trillions of dollars into the financial system did not overcome the contradictions manifested in speculation--the expression of the laws of the capitalist mode of production laid bare by Marx--but exacerbated them.

The rise and rise of financial wealth accumulation in the decade following the 2008 crisis is not the outcome of growth in the real economy. In fact, the ""recovery"" since 2009 has been the weakest in the post-war period, and marked by the fall of investment in the real economy to historic lows and a decline in productivity.

After the Lehman crisis, finance capital responded to the blowing up of its previous mechanisms for profit accumulation via speculation by creating new ones. One of these, exchange traded notes based on ""shorting"" the volatility index, or Vix--that is, betting on continued market calm, has now resulted in the most significant turbulence since the 2008 crash.

However, these new forms of speculation are only a trigger. The broader significance of the recent volatility and whatever else eventuates--no one is sure that the storm has passed--is that it was provoked by the prospect of faster growth and a push by the working class for higher wages following decades of the suppression of the class struggle.

Economic events have once again confirmed the essential conclusion of Marx's analysis of the laws of motion of the capitalist economy. Whatever its ups and downs and even periods of long upturn, the accumulation of profit--the essential driving force of capitalism--is, in the final analysis, based on the ongoing suppression of the working class and its impoverishment.

The lie, which forms the basis of all bourgeois economics, that somehow the growth of capitalist economy can, at least in the long run, provide the road to advancement for the mass of humanity, the working class, the producers of all wealth, has been exposed. It has been laid bare by the fact that signs of economic growth and a growing movement of workers against the decline in living standards have raised the prospect of a new financial disaster, even more serious than that of a decade ago.

Marx's analysis of the laws of motion of capital--laws which express themselves, as he put it, in the same way that the law of gravity asserts itself when a house collapses around our ears--far from being refuted or rendered outdated, have been confirmed by living events.

This analysis, and Marx's central conclusion that the working class has to take conscious control of the very wealth it has produced, must become its guiding perspective in the struggles now unfolding.

This historic task does not arise out of an abstract theoretical construct. In opposition to all the nostrums of bourgeois economy, which are self-serving justifications of the capitalist system, Marx's analysis is a scientific elaboration of the objective tendencies and inherent logic of capitalist development.

This logic, which assumes ever-more explosive forms, now poses directly before the international working class the necessity, if humanity is to avert a catastrophe and advance, to fight in every struggle for a perspective based on the overthrow of the reactionary and historically-outmoded profit system. That is the essential meaning of the latest round of turmoil on the financial markets.

"Liberals have no theory of power When I talk with American liberals (both the conservative and progressive stripe), I walk away wondering if they have any clue about how the world works outside of their favorite institutions. They seem to have no theory of power -- or at least, their theory of power is limited to very formal structures of capitalist institutions, which blinds them to seeing maneuvers that occurs outside of those institutions.

One common failure is how both wings of liberalism equate conservatism with 'anti-government'. This leads them to making nonsenical claims, including that the people trying to install the [sitting President as dictator are somehow 'anti-government'](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/ivy-league-apologists-january-6-gop-elitism-populsim/621153/) and anti-elite. Wanting a *different* government, does not make you anti-government. Wanting the government to knock heads for capital does not make you anti-government. The Trumpists who worship the idea of police are the most brazen pro-state force in the country. Contrast them with the [anti-authoritarian activists](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/05/1070471256/amateur-sleuths-help-to-identify-hundreds-of-suspected-jan-6-rioters) who work to identify Jan 6 rioters, but provide that information to reporters and activists rather than police.

Similarly, groups of liberals often minimize Trump's dictatorial power-grab by asserting that he didn't *do* anything -- by which they mean that he did not explicitly order anyone to do anything illegal. They ignore how he constantly expressed support for illegal acts such as extrajudicial punishment and even execution by the police, and how he hinted that he would (legally) use his wealth and power to protect those who broke the law in his service. American liberals seem to be so thoroughly indoctrinated with the ideology of liberal capitalism, that they can't see the complex power-plays that have been the essence of power since the [dawn of civilization](https://art19.com/shows/tides-of-history/episodes/511687bb-0049-47a9-8bb0-6f5ec01a1fee).",Liberal
