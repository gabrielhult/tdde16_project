Fun fact: did you know that if your parents divorce, you’re more likely to get much more financial aid when you eventually go to college? This is what happened to me, and since my Mom only gets her income considered for aid, it’s basically given me a ticket for a full ride to the public university I go to now as a commuter.

I don’t deserve it. I guess I do technically when the “math” is done, but what I mean is that I don’t deserve it EXCLUSIVELY all to myself and anyone else like me in the same place. I hate seeing other people have to financially fuck themselves over for years just so they can have a living wage. It’s stupid.

'Class Struggle Unionism' hosted by The Virginia Worker,Liberal,7,t0ekza,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/t0ekza/class_struggle_unionism_hosted_by_the_virginia/,1,"Join The Virginia Worker for our second event of the year, featuring union organizer and author Joe Burns as he presents on his latest book 'Class Struggle Unionism'

Class struggle unionism is the belief that our union struggle exists within a larger struggle between an exploiting billionaire class and the working class which actually produces the goods and services in society. Class struggle unionism looks at the employment transaction as inherently exploitative. While workers create all wealth in society, the outcome of the wage employment transaction is to separate workers from that wealth and create the billionaire class.

From that simple proposition flows a powerful and radical form of unionism. Historically, class struggle unionists placed their workplace fights squarely within this larger fight between workers and the owning class. Viewing unionism in this way produces a particular type of unionism which both fights for broader class issues but is also rooted in workplace-based militancy.

Future of Social democracy USA,Liberal,10,syrtyd,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/syrtyd/future_of_social_democracy_usa/,19,How long do you think until something resembling social democracy may occur in the us? With recent events I’ve increasingly come to believe that it may take more than 20 years at a minimum for this to occur even basic things like universal healthcare via public option (forget m4a) seem unlikely within this decade. I originally had plenty of optimism for change from Biden but Now it simply looks like the consensus will remain. Now this isn’t entirely his fault (well most of the time at least) but it is disappointing. Additionally I think the increase in inflation and other economic problems (real or imaginary) will push it back at least another 10 years alone. I’m also increasingly worried of the republicans creating a stranglehold on the senate within the near future and they have shown no interest in even negotiating about improvements (despite what they claim). And this is coming from someone who doesn’t even Id as a social democrat. Sorry for the negative tone but I’m quickly believing that only something radical (whether democratic or not) will create necessary change in this country.

Russia has ordered troops into Eastern Ukraine. What should the US do in response?,Liberal,13,syplgm,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/syplgm/russia_has_ordered_troops_into_eastern_ukraine/,17,"Hi,

So it looks like it is happen. Putin has recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics and has ordered troops into the region for *ahem* ""peacekeeping operations"". To anyone with a brain, Russia is now basically invading the separatist regions of Ukraine.

So, what should the US do? To be clear, I personally view what Russia is doing as deeply immoral. It is the invasion of a sovereign state that has the right to self determination should it choose. Hell the whole reason that they want to join NATO is this exact fear, the fear of Russian invasion. Invading smaller states that aren't attacking you nor are a threat to you is wrong. And it's condemning Ukraine to a war and civilians to violence. It's wrong. 

But, it is fairly rare for morality to play a significant role in international politics, as politics is a game of self interest.

We could and should enact sanctions and hurt the Russian elites wallets as much as possible (Germany canceling the pipeline is good), and we should send weapons to Ukraine. I don't think anyone disputes that

However, the question is American troop involvement or more direct aid.

I can understand both sides to this argument and I am not sure which to side with. What are your thoughts.

1) isolation. Ukraine isn't part of NATO, as much as it would like to be. It isn't American territory, and we don't really have a reason to go there. If we did, then we would risk nuclear war with Russia over a country that isn't even a NATO member let alone actual American territory. It would condemn American teenagers to a possible death and further fuel a conflict already in progress. It could even expand into WWIII if we aren't careful. And we could just end up in another forever war. Plus all the weapons companies are lobbying hard for conflict, you think that will change once the conflict gets going?

2) troops on the ground. The US and Russia are not technically at war. If American troops were on the ground and Russia wanted to avoid a war with the Americans then they couldn't really fire at them. Now obviously this could easily escalate and we could end up in a conflict with Russia. But it's a mistake to view any conflict between the US and Russia as a nuclear one. All the US would really have to do is hold back the Russians. They wouldn't even have to enter Russian territory. And that means that Russia wouldn't have the pretext for escalation, and MAD would ensure they don't start a nuclear war. Is it risky? Yeah. I mean that's assuming Putin doesn't think his power rests on the result of Ukraine and that all the Russian oligarchs agree. Furthermore,  we do technically have a treaty obligation to Ukraine. When the ussr collapsed, there were a shit ton of nukes in Ukraine. Ukraine didn't know what to do with them, and so made a treaty with Russia and the west, wherein they would get help decommissioning nukes and in exchange Ukraine's territory wouldn't be violated. What kind of message does it send to other countries when, after getting rid of nukes, they get invaded. It happened to Gadaffi, it happened in Iraq, and now Ukraine. You know who hasn't gotten rid of their nukes and hasn't been invaded? North Korea. Other countries are going to notice that pattern. How many nuclear actors do we want? How many is stable? I wouldn't be surprised if other Eastern European states started working on nukes. That's a problem. Plus this conflict will probably lead to another refugee crisis that will further destabilize the EU and likely lead to a fracturing of one of our most important allies, undermining one of the largest economies in the world, etc. Appeasement doesn't work and Putin probably won't stop at Ukraine. The question is, should we care if they don't stop?",1645541952.0

Instead of focusing on growth, prosperity, and the ""rise of Russia"" that propagandists like to rant about, we are going to spend money on potentially the most pointless conflict in our history.

Sanctions are going to hit any growth we've seen in real wages, and jobs are going to become scarce as businesses in Russia and elsewhere will hesitate to expand or even to start. Poverty in Russia (which mostly affects young families and homes with children) has remained stable despite efforts to lower it, now the money used for those programmes will go straight to war and to Donetsk and Luhansk.

As some Muscovites were saying yesterday, there were no income supports during the COVID lockdown because the money wasn't there. Now it turns out we have the cash for adventurism in Europe. Every Washington hawk just had their insane ramblings confirmed. Every millionaire Russian propagandist (Solovyov/Kiselev) just had their work programme for the next fifty years handed to them. Both of these groups are secure in their jobs but not everyday people with families.

Help and insight needed.,Liberal,0,sxyydr,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sxyydr/help_and_insight_needed/,2,"I have been considering what the Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey said in reply to the question of ‘if the bank was also implicitly asking workers not to demand big pay rises’, to which he replied ‘Broadly, yes’. The article suggests that we’re \[currently\] enjoying a pay rise of just below 5% on average.  

What seems to be suggested here is that any increases in wages are ultimately passed onto the consumer \[us\], so asking for a pay rise is, in effect, creating a vicious cycle of rising costs, negating any pay rises we may achieve. The only way we can combat this is by accepting the status quo, keeping wages like they are and accepting a huge squeezing house hold incomes.

What I’m trying to figure out is how a company can give good pay rises whilst keeping their costs down so they can deliver the same product for the same cost to the consumer and so negating the catch22 the capitalists are trying to force upon us. The best way that I can see is by levelling the playfield when it comes to the disparity of pay between the top and the bottom within the organisation and also reducing dividends to share holders.  

I was wondering if there was anyone who could help to point me in the right direction to contact economists and people with experience of big business that could offer insight and critique to further this idea. 

I realise that saying to your bosses that they should take a pay decrease in order that you can have a pay increase is a hell of a stretch but I think we really need to start thinking outside of the box of traditional capitalistic thought to come up with some radical solutions of our own.",1645464113.0

> We should expect enormous opposition to this socialization of property from the current private owners. To compensate the current owners—including all working people whose savings had been tied up in stocks, bonds, and land—**the government will issue long- term annuities.**

[...]

> This ring will include some entire industries, **such as banking and finance**, telecommunications, public transportation, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, energy, automobile, steel, aluminum, and the defense industrial base.

[...]

> And any external financing of these [smaller private] enterprises will come from banks, which, being now publicly owned, will use our democratically determined strategic criteria to **make credit-allocation decisions**.

[...]

> We will encourage these [publicly-owned] enterprises to compete on quality and service by **setting a common price for their services**. (If we allowed competition on price, we would be creating a powerful incentive to squeeze labor, and that would be contrary to our goals.)

[...]

> Financial incentives are a second tool. **We will offer workers a collective bonus** that rewards them if their enterprise achieves high output but also penalizes them if their output is either below or above the target. This will help ensure that the economic councils are receiving good information from the enterprises about their capabilities.

> I speak here of the wages of labor. What, it will be said, will there be wages in the new society? Shall we not have abolished wage labor and money? How then can one speak of the wages of labor? These objections would be sound if the social revolution proposed to immediately abolish money. I maintain that this would be impossible. Money is the simplest means known up to the present time which makes it possible in as complicated a mechanism as that of the modern productive process, with its tremendous far-reaching division of labor, to secure the circulation of products and their distribution to the individual members of society. It is the means which makes it possible for each one to satisfy his necessities according to his individual inclination (to be sure within the bounds of his economic power). As a means to such circulation money will be found indispensable until something better is discovered.",1645327349.0

Hi guys after reading some books on Marxist theory I’m still confused about this aspect.

1 did Marx believe that the material living standards of the working class will increase or decrease with the development of capitalism 

2 Why did workers living standards in reality in western countries inxrease during the 20th century 

3 With globalisation will we see a decrease of workers standard of living in the west.

What is the difference between Socialism and Democratic Socialism?,Liberal,15,sv60tm,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/sv60tm/what_is_the_difference_between_socialism_and/,13," There are many different definitions of *socialism* and *democratic socialism* out there. Many experts seem to disagree on certain definitions. On the Communist Manifesto, Marx refers to the terms *Communism* and *Socialism* interchangeably.

Some people view *Socialism* as a **diluted Communism**.

Some people view *Socialism* as a **transitionary state** **with** ***Communism*** **as an end goal**.

When we get into the gist of socialism, we of course refer mainly to the *proletariat* taking control of the [means of production and a planned economy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/socialism.asp)**.**

What *communism* and *socialism* have in common would be:

\-The state being in control of the **means of production**

\-A **planned economy**

From some views, the differences between *communism* and *socialism* consists in:

\-There **still being** [**private property in socialism**](https://7esl.com/socialism-vs-communism/)

\-Small businesses could still operate (local stores)

From what I seem to understand, the [differences between socialism and democratic socialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcAQB3oPzt0) are as follows:

\-Democratic socialists **reject** the Marxist-Leninist concept of **planned economy**

\-Democratic socialists have ***some*** aspect of *capitalism* when it comes to *supply and demand*

\-Democratic socialists want to [**nationalize most key industries but not all**](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-socialism-and-democratic-socialism/)

\-Democratic socialists want **company decisions to be made by employees** [(workers' self-management)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management)

\-Democratic socialists **do not want a one party state**, instead wanting a **full democracy with multiple parties**

I remember when Trump was President and he was loudly, and rightfully, criticized over his handling of the pandemic by both Democrats and the public. What Trump did was flout most every scientific guideline on preventing the spread, gave minimal assistance to workers during the pandemic (a $1,200 dorito check, followed by a $600 skittles check) instead of the robust monthly assistance, medical care, and psychiatric care needed for a widely suffering population. There was, rightfully, an outcry over a ""9/11 a day"" when 3,000 people were dying at one of the pandemic's worst points in 2020. And people were rightfully disturbed by conservative rhetoric that we should get used to mass death and that well, grandma has lived a full life is it really so bad if she dies? Or, also conservative, rhetoric that schools should be reopened in the midst of the crisis. That was originally a Trump administration proposal.

It feels like since that time, everyone has lost their collective sense of reason and it's been thanks to an increasingly rightward shift of both Democrats and Republicans. Around 3,000 people are dying a day of Covid-19, right now, and you barely hear a word about it. In fact, what you do hear is treatises from the New York Times about how ""Covid is in retreat"" (apparently so, for the 19th time). Mass death has been completely normalized. Schools have been reopened in many locations with many kids and parents and teachers becoming ill with some dying entirely preventable deaths from Covid-19. Federal assistance has largely ceased with most people being herded back to work. It seems like many people are either too mentally exhausted to be outraged or care about what's going on and any outrage that still exists is focused on a minority of antivaxxers, or is focused on what public health measures remain in the name of ""freedom"".

If it wasn't for the vaccine, deaths in the US would almost certainly be far, far higher than they are. And those deaths have only happened to sociopathic government policy prioritizing the economy over human lives, both under Trump and Biden. Government policy that is still killing people over 2 years later.

Super bubble and the need for global rationality...,Liberal,4,srzs53,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/srzs53/super_bubble_and_the_need_for_global_rationality/,0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlEGU2ypr1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlEGU2ypr1Q)

Capitalism as we know it might collapse completely. And no better to hear it than from someone who is deeply embedded inside that system...

Socialism had baby steps, like a child it stumbled and the technique to manage rationally resources in common for the benefit of all is an inexact science... but I believe the collapse in the stock markets and all the bubbles... crypto, housing, and basically the Las Vegas mentality of something for nothing will have to come to realistic expectations.

Climate change means we need to live within what the ecosystem can afford to provide for us, and the margin is thin with 9 billion people soon on that fragile and precarious world. And the limits of a finite world means no more endless growth and plundering of wealth from weaker nations and the end of economic colonialism.

Oligarchic nepotism, the late stage of Catabolitic Capitalism, is also bound to be destroyed.

The key is believe in a simple boolean operator: AND.

Cooperation over Competition, or at least restrict Competition to one of ideas and let conflicts play out in the war of optimizing a solution to all problems, not do it with real people and real resources as capitalism proposes it in the framework of an obsolete way of thinking.",1644806526.0
How my perception of the wealth gap has changed,Liberal,54,srutqu,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/srutqu/how_my_perception_of_the_wealth_gap_has_changed/,4,"I recently came across an interesting [chart](https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1275123151614115840/photo/1) that changed my perspective on the growing wealth gap. The S&P500 tracks the combined value of the 500 largest US publicly traded companies, expressed in USD ($). With the exception of brief recessions, it has shown persistent, steep growth since Standard and Poor's founded the index in the late 1950s. However if the S&P500 was priced in gold, (a non-inflationary form of money), the growth flattens with more pronounced corrective cycles. This is symptomatic of the federal reserve's quantitative easing (printing money out of thin air) and economic stimulus packages in full swing. So in other words, the S&P500 is not an indicator of economic activity by the biggest companies but a barometer of debasement of the dollar.

The S&P500 is an index that almost every institutional and serious retail investor has in their portfolio. Sovereign wealth funds and pension funds inflation proof the pension money of millions of ageing citizens by investing it in public companies like Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet etc, or in indexes like the S&P500. All private equity funds or hedge funds have their performance benchmarked according to the S&P500 as shareholders can just withdraw their money from the fund and invest it in the S&P500 instead. Most regular people who invest a portion of their paycheck, who don't have the time or confidence to follow specific companies, invest their disposable income in the S&P500. The whole reason why all entities, big and small, invest in indexes like the S&P500 is a hedge against inflation. 

Inflation is inescapable, given that we live in a world where central banks or national governments dictate monetary policy. Everything from interest rates to inflation is parameterised by them, which makes them responsible for incentivising behavior in the market. In 1971, the US got rid of the gold standard which had given the dollar ""world reserve currency"" status. It sought to maintain this status by coupling the value of dollars to oil sales on the global markets. Together with Saudi Arabia and OPEC, it created the petro-dollar which meant oil producing nations only accepted dollars for the purchase of their oil in exchange for military protection. So every country needed huge stockpiles of dollars to feed their glut for oil, globally distributing inflation caused by the fed, as opposed to locally in the US, giving the US supreme economic power. Wars were waged to impose oil for dollar trading on oil rich nations that suddenly stopped dancing to the US's tune. A big weapons complex industry grew bigger, the mainstream media became a propaganda arm of the US government, delegitimising the issue of climate change became a strategic objective by politicians and the rest is history. 

It is impossible to pin down motives and dependencies but what is clear is that there is a global super structure of governments, central banks, massive militaries, fossil fuel entities, and the mainstream media that direct ""the world order"". The actions of this cartel affects common people by recklessly creating market bubbles with serious implications on pension funds, job loss, and destruction of citizen investments. It affects people by locking them into permanent debt repayment for the reckless spending by the governments. It affects people by forcing them to subsidise the bad habits of certain crooked companies such as the bank bailouts of 2008. It immiserates working class citizens with little to no disposable income or financial literacy by reducing the buying power of their income.

This cartel is what you should be fighting. All concerns about unaffordable housing, unaffordable university, health care, tax evasion, regulatory capture pale in comparison. I used to think that things were not working correctly because of these issues, but it turns out that they are consequences of a deeper problem. Until we realise that both political parties in America are two faces of the same coin, and that everything wrong with capitalism is due to mis-parameterisation by this cartel, we will just be swatting shadows and radicalizing ourselves.",1644791226.0

Did Merkel's choice to let in hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany help the German economy and Germans?

How? imo it was a bad economic choice , but great moral one.

[On page 27 and 28, it shows that germany/ deutschland(DEU) is one of the few countries where **Immigrants have a net negative fiscal impact.**](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1602.pdf)

[This is unlike the US where refugees are net positive fiscal impact.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23498)

If immigrants to Germany are bad for the German economy, doesn't that mean that refugees to Germany are also bad for the Germany economy? I am assuming that the average refugee is less productive and educated than the average immigrant.

I guess it would have been great if Merkel let in high skilled refugees. Is the IMF spreading outdated info?",1644335340.0

Singaporean healthcare,Liberal,24,smizrq,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/smizrq/singaporean_healthcare/,5,"Singapore, being an eastern capitalist society, is known for having an efficiency and mastery of technology that is able to rival Japan, China, and Hong Kong. But to some, Singapore’s best economic reform comes from her healthcare system. It uses a system of mixed financing complementing a system with 3 main institutions. Medisave, a mandatory savings account in which the employee and the employer, must deposit part of their paycheck in. It is used to pay for insurance and medical bills, but deliberately designed to not cover any one medical expense. The second institution is Medishield, which is a health insurance program. But because of medisave, medishield is very affordable. Finally there is medifund, a last ditch endowment for anybody who cannot afford their medical expenses. This system alongside large government subsidies in to healthcare, allow for Singapore to provide some of the best healthcare in the world at just 4% gdp spent on medical expenses.(The UK is 9% and the USA 18%). This is a system that is proposed as a replacement to traditional universal healthcare, because it gets better results at lower costs. Others claim the system as infeasible to use in most western countries, due to Singapore’s unique economic system. What do you think? Can this system be used everywhere else?

Capitalistic Contradictions & Their Consequences,Liberal,7,skq9k6,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/skq9k6/capitalistic_contradictions_their_consequences/,0,"(Narrated version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3Sgnt1Gsc))

The system of capitalism creates environments and goals that are contradictory to each other, and these core contradictions become amplified overtime until capitalist society collapses. For the benefit of the system, its participants and its media are dependent on ignoring and even distracting us from these very problems.

Initially, we are put on the treadmill of consumerism, quantity of products being prioritized over quality to keep this treadmill going. Another trend to follow, the newest version of a thing to buy, our living costs -- a bill that follows us until we die. Now, what is interesting about this constant-going treadmill of consumerism is that we are simultaneously expected to run on it and also bear the ball and chain of debt. We are expected to still continuously consume and purchase while suffering long-term debts from college and vehicles, and for the lucky few these days, mortgages. If it isn’t already nonsensical enough that you are expected to run on this treadmill of consumerism while bearing the ball and chain of debt, capitalism has devised a system in which that debt drives your further consumerism. 

Holding off a bigger ball and chain so you can run faster on the treadmill; credit card debt overtime became a necessity in modern capitalism. Not only to develop a credit score, but to push off the costs of your basic needs onto credit cards with the expectation that there will be some kind of magical “future money” later, I’ll elaborate more on this in a bit. 

See, this is a contradictory system. We cannot be expected to purchase and bear financial burdens at the same time, and the nonsensical solution of trying to turn those debts into something that will drive consumerism is even more absurd. Supremely absurd, however, is the capitalist response to the slowing of the treadmill of consumerism when these contradictions begin to halt it. 

Instead of finding these obvious contradictions at fault, they instead blame the consumers for the “wrong” type of consumerism. Don’t buy coffee, stop eating avocado toast, stop doing “this” and “that” kind of consumerism. Companies now treat consumer value as a zero-sum game that they must fight amongst themselves to divvy in their favor, when in reality, the increasingly extreme contradictions of consumerism create not a zero sum, but an actively shrinking sum game, where there is even less to divvy as anything non-essential is cut. 

A corporation will still blame the consumer instead of acknowledging the contradiction. “The millennials killed the suit industry” they’ll say, “people are buying less jewelry, less diamond rings, less luxuries” and we the consumers are still blamed for the contradictions of the system, for if the capitalists acknowledged these contradictions, they would be conceding to its critics. 

This consumer and debt culture -- it makes us dependent on the wishy-washy capitalist concept of “future money”. The “buy now pay later” kind of lifestyle. The racking up of credit card debts, and predatory loans with high interest rates that make them impossible to pay off. The funny thing about capitalism is that all that wealth will eventually be concentrated to the top. The funny thing about capitalism is that you will eventually run out of other people’s money. And then what? We run out and then we create future money. It’s all gone now, but there will be more later, surely! This system has to work! 

Here the world plays about with future money not even just on the consumer scale, but even on the scale of an entire nation. Drafting hundreds of billions of dollars for a military that isn’t in any major wars, finding the most wasteful and complex ways to bomb people in countries Americans can’t even point out on a map. People who had absolutely no chance of fighting back, but people just scary enough to convince the brain dead that we need even MORE imaginary future money to eradicate them. The plutocrats get to participate in their thievery now, but the tab for the cost of this future money is on the income taxes of every working class American. We all could’ve spent this on ourselves, for our general welfare, for the people who had to beg for their lives on GoFundMe, but we spent it on plutocrats who bombed foreigners.

Then we get to the other damning contradiction of the capitalist system, the way in which we slave away for all of these nickels and dimes and so-called “future money”. Here’s a system in which two different groups of people are trying to make all the money: you and your boss. If one makes more, the other makes less. The “profits” so to speak of a business can only go in the hands of one group of people, those who produce it, or those who thieve it. The eternal “tug of rope” between the worker and their capitalist boss. Just as the plutocrats have control over how we spend the nation’s “future money”, so too do they try to have a grip on the “profit” produced by their workers; and just like the “future money” of a nation, it’s not just theft, it’s wasted!

Give a capitalist fifty dollars and they’ll put it in an off-shore, tax-exempt bank account and then ask for more. Give a worker fifty dollars and it’s instantly recirculated into the economy. We cannot trust that a capitalist making more of the profits will make products cheaper or the capitalist more generous, they are hoarders by the nature of their role in this kind of society. A worker cannot afford to hoard in such a way, it’s spent on needs, it’s spread out, it’s recirculated. They have no reason for the nonsensical idea of keeping money they never intend to use. 

The consumer contradictions hurt the consumer, and the workplace contradictions hurt the worker. It is those who are not plutocrats that lose every time when the contradictions of capitalism are allowed to continue. A capitalist will not starve if their bottom line isn’t sky-high, but a worker will surely suffer if they miss even one paycheck. A capitalist will not sweat it if one less person buys their product, but a consumer will be left without their basic needs if not to be able to purchase it. 

For as long as the contradiction between the interests of centralized and decentralized wealth exists, the gains will always be upon the capitalists, and the losses upon the workers; the people. There is no amount of “regulation” or “competition” that makes these core contradictions any different. As long as they are allowed to exist, there is economic injustice in the world.",1644013594.0

How I found optimism amongst this broken system,Liberal,28,siho94,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/siho94/how_i_found_optimism_amongst_this_broken_system/,17,"I only really started to find optimism in this broken world when I started to talk to my community, to my neighbors. When I started to talk to them about my problems with the system, that’s when they started to open up to sharing their problems with the system. 

For example, the run down apartments that we live in, where maintenance/management avoids fixing the actual problem and puts a bandaid solution over the resulting problem caused by the other problem (lol). By sharing my problems with the system, in a super casual way, I learned that others are having problems with the astronomical rises in rent. And other maintenance bandaid over the bullet hole (proverbially) “solutions”. 

Once I started talking to my neighbors, and sharing my issues, like an olive branch of peace (but also calm discontent with the system), I started to learn about their issues and pains, and really relate to them on a personal level. It starts a casual conversation of discontent with things as they are. By having these conversations, and finding out essentially who my allies are, who will have each other’s back if we were to try to make a change for the better, you then find yourself working together to really find solutions. 

We can’t fix this alone. This has to be a combined effort. There are ways to reach out to others peacefully, and to work towards overcoming the problems at the root. But you have to start small. For some it may be starting a union at work. For others it could be creating a tenants union. Maybe for someone else it’s making an organization to offer food to the hungry, drafting legislation to fix parts of the system at the top (rent control, rights for tenant unions, outreach programs, workers unionization rights), or maybe a petition on something else entirely. 

The way to get people to open up to you is to mingle with them and find out what they are passionate about. But first you have to reflect on yourself and see what YOU are passionate about. Find your niche and then start thinking of things that you can do within that niche to really make a difference. You can’t do it alone. None of us can. We have to work together, and find a community feeling, to be able to evolve together. 

Another point, Use tact and grace to really start to understand people. Why do the people do what they do? Is what they are doing because they are a bad person, or because they were forced to do what they had to within a broken system? Once you find compassion for others, and can understand why they do what they do, then you can really relate to them and slowly help them change for the better!

It will have to start within the guidelines of the systems as they are now. Follow the rules, and no one will get hurt, so to speak. People are scared. Of the world, of what is happening in the world. They feel helpless. Hopeless. I know I have, often. But by reaching out and starting a casual conversation you than can start to relate, have each other’s backs, and start to brainstorm solutions. 

I am careful to avoid any talk of socialism, or anything like that. I talk about the basic principles of it though. About the inequality and prejudice of the world. People can relate to that. The basic principles. The basic human needs of housing, food, water, community, clothing, and livable wages. It has to start somewhere. And we have to start small, from many different angles. 

Don’t give up hope. Together, we can do anything.",1643783452.0

Question About Trade and Exploitation of the 3rd world,Liberal,6,sgtuuy,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sgtuuy/question_about_trade_and_exploitation_of_the_3rd/,13,"I am a college socialist with a rather technical question about international trade. I often hear that wealthy capitalist 'first world' nations exploit the third world by extracting resources and taking advantage of cheap labor to provide consumer goods to the imperial core. 

However when I looked up [international balance of trade by country](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/trade_balance/Asia/) I was suprised to see that the countries with a positive balance of trade (export more goods and services) are generally wealthy and countries with a negative balance of trade (import more goods and services) are generally poor. There are outliers of course (like the US), but the general trend is unmistakable, and the richer a country is, the more likely it is to have a positive trade balance, and vice-versa.

All of this is to say that while I don't have enough knowledge to understand the implications of this data, at face value it makes it seem like goods and services are moving more from the core to the periphery and not the other way around. But again, I don't know how this is calculated exactly, or what I could be missing in this equation. Can anybody provide some clarity on this?

Also just to be clear this is NOT western imperialist apologia. I'm just trying to understand this issue more thoroughly",1643608458.0

A champion for womens rights and feminism - Johanna Dohnal,Liberal,22,sfruyd,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sfruyd/a_champion_for_womens_rights_and_feminism_johanna/,1,"Hello fellow comrades, colleagues and friends

&#x200B;

as I was recently browsing my film inventory over at Apple+, I found a movie called *Dohnal* about the first Minister for Womens Affairs in Austria, Johanna Dohnal. A person to which I, as a man, can say with pride that I look up to. The respect she deserves for her work can not be described in words - showing a different view of the world in terms of equality and justice. A woman with the mental strength of several people - with humour and great politics, a figure loved and despised at the same time. And a woman that is for me the personified incanation of womens rights as well as feminism.

For that reason and to show that this sub cares about women and their rights too, I'd like to introduce to you: **Johanna Dohnal**.

&#x200B;

**Birth and early upbringing**

Johanna Dohnal was born on February 14th 1939 in Vienna with the maiden name Diez. She was an illegitimate child, a thing that would shape her very much. Johanna grew up at her grandmothers place in Viennas 14th District (also known as Wien-Penzing) while her mother either worked or suffered from tuberculosis most of the time. Another dimension was the war - she was six years old when the Second World War came to an end. Alongside this, the Nazi regime and the fight for survival of her granmother shaped her very much. In school, she was unique - she didn't know her father alongside her being illegitimate while the other children either had fathers still alive or dead due to the war.

Her grandmother was poor (dressmaker by trade) and got a small pension in her old days - a regular tale Johanna often told was the following: her grandmother would take a wet cloth and beat it on a Sunday morning  - so the neighbours would believe she'd prepare *Wiener Schnitzel* (which they couldn't afford). Her grandmother was ashamed of being poor, which was made worse by the war shortages and rationing after the war. Johannas seat in school was a wooden crate she couldn't afford to loose, as it too was used as the coal crate.

She went to *Volksschule* and *Hauptschule* (primary school) and began a traineeship as an industrial clerk (for her time a rare occupation for women) in a plastics factory, she later became *Betriebsrätin* (workers council member) in said factory. Although she was good at school and was keen on learning more, the poor living conditions denied her access to better education - another trigger that would shape her future way.

&#x200B;

**Politics and marriage**

Johanna Diez joined the then named *Sozialistische Partei Österreichs* (Socialist Party of Austria, the SPÖ) in 1956 at age 16. At first she was engaged with the local Kinderfreunde (a youth organisation of the party) as well as secretary for her local party section in Wien-Penzing.

In 1957 she married her first and only husband, Franz Dohnal - a tramway driver. Johanna brought two children into the world - Robert (1959) and Ingrid (1961). From 1960 onwards they lived in a *Gemeindebauwohnung* with 48 square meters. As they needed the money (her husband would shovel snow in the winter alongside his job) she returned to work very fast after her first birth, after her second birth she was fired. As there were no cheap child care facilities in her area, she stayed at home and did *Heimarbeiten* (home work) until she found another job in 1969 as a secretary for a locksmiths shop.

Her husband Franz was a classic man of his time - conservative in family matters. On a walk through the park with his family he lamented that his shirt wasn't ironed and missed a button, Johanna didn't care much about that. She never accepted her role a house wife - and showed her determination in matters of emancipation. She would divorce from Franz in 1976, the new divorce laws of Bruno Kreisky and his SPÖ government allowed that process.

&#x200B;

**Entering office**

Again in 1969, Johanna was appointed as Bezirksrätin (district council member) for her district as an SPÖ member leading to her being appointed as chairwoman of the *SPÖ-Frauen* (SPÖ Womens Section) for her district. One year later she would be elected as federal state secretary for women in Vienna with her office in the SPÖ Headquarters in the famous *Löwelstraße -* being added to the *Bundesparteivorstand* (Federal party heads).

From 1973 to 1979 she was a member of Viennas Municipal Council/State Council (Vienna is a federal state of Austria, so Municipal and State council are the same with the Mayor being Prime Minister of the state too).

Already in 1978 she showed her determination on a local level by founding the *Verein Soziale Hilfen für gefährdete Frauen und Kinder* (Association of Social Assistance for vulnerable Women and Children) which founded the first *Frauenhaus* (a protective institution for Women and their childred in fear of physical or mental abuse). That was the most known action of hers, she launched a lot of ideas and initiatives in her time in local Viennese politics that were often seen as radical. Like her campaign for better sexual education in Viennese school as well as improving social services, espeically for working women. Special recognition earned her campaign for legal abortion in Austria in 1974, a year later the law was passed after a hotly contested debate about it.

But said radicalism would open her a big door.

&#x200B;

**Frauenstaatssekretärin**

In 1979, at the party conference in Villach, she and three other women were appointed as new *Staatssekretärinnen* (Female State Secretaries). Johanna Dohnal was one of them, becoming *Staatssekretär für allgemeine Frauenfragen* (State secretary for general womens questions) attached to the *Bundeskanzleramt* (Federal Chancellory) under Bruno Kreisky. Kreisky valued the input of women very much - an opinion that surprised a lot of party members as well as Austria in general. One thing that surprised her was that the letter paper coming with her new office said *Staatssekretär* \- the male version - and not *Staatssekretärin* \- the female version of the word (a thing she soon tried to correct). Already in 1979 she produced some discrepancies with some men in the SPÖ as she was more radical than most women in the party. That was the reason she was put into the Federal Chancellory as the Interior Minister didn't want her.

In late 1979 she started work on a program for women in federal employment - to improve their conditions and gaining them more rights. At the second Worlds Women Congress in Copenhagen i 1980 she not only led the Austrian delegation but was Vice President of the Congress. This gained her international reputation as a very active womens rights fighter.

Her programs in her early time in office included improved birth protection laws for working women of all branches as well as improvements in family law, sexual crime law and social law in favour of women. Some particular achievements were the legal equation of rape outside and inside of a marriage, building a network of *Frauenhäusern* all over Austria as well as birth protection laws for female farmers (adding financial benefits).

In 1983, with the inclusion of the FPÖ into government and the change from Kreisky to Fred Sinowatz as chancellor, her job got a bit tougher. While Kreisky as quite open with women and their ideas of emancipation, Sinowatz and most of the FPÖ were more moderate on the topic. Still she achieved a lot as *Staatssekretär*. Said title was a point of deabte for her - she argued that it was necessary to introduce correct titles for women and not use the male term.

Besides her work on Womens questions she engaged herself in the peace movement of the early 1980s as well as in development (she was a fond supporter of the EZA - *Entwicklungszusammenarbeit* \[Developmental Cooperation - a program of cooperation between the First and Third World\]) and educational questions.

&#x200B;

***Frauenministerin*** **at last**

With 1986 came another change - Sinowatz left politics and Franz Vranitzky entered as Chancellor in coalition with the christian-conservative ÖVP in a *Große Koalition* (Grand Coalition), the first after 20 years - this time under SPÖ leadership. Vranitzky was sympathetic with the fight for Womens Rights and attended several press conferences, where most reporters were women. But some of his colleagues in the SPÖ weren't as sympathetic to this question as Vranitzky was. For example - after the introduction of the *Reißverschlusssstem* (zipper system also knwon as the *50:50 Forderung* \- meaning that men and women would be put equally on the voting lists like #1 a man, #2 a woman etc.) which she heavily promoted, some said to Vranktzky that its realisation won't happen anyway (jokes on them, it did).

1987 would be another great milestone for Johanna Dohnal - becoming *Bundesfrauenvorsitzende* (Federal Womens Chair) of the party, the highest office for Womens Rights and Questions in the party itself. Alongside this, she too was appointed to the post of *stellvertretende Bundesparteivorsitzende* (Deputy Party Chair Woman) for the SPÖ.

After the election of 1990 and some pressure on Vranitzky, the position of *Bundesministerin für Frauenangelegenheiten* (Federal Minister for Womens Affairs) was established with Johanna Dohnal as first *Minister* \- again the male term on the official letter paper. This proved as a great achievement for women in Austria. Her focus as Minster was on the question of compatibility of family work and job, working towards equality between men and women as well as protection against physical/mental abuse and violence against women. Introducing laws against sexual harassment, ending the *Amtsvormundschaft* (agengy guardianship) for unmarried women, stronger protection against abuse and violence were introduced in the early 1990s under her term. Adding to these came equal treatment laws for public service, a *Frauenquote* (womens quota) in Universities and Minstries.

In her time as *Staatssekretärin* as well as *Ministerin* she was a loved figure not only by most party members, but by a lot of people in general. But she attracted hate as well - she had passionate debates on television with lawyers and mostly stubborn men. Surprisingly, she handled this all with a cool and rational mind, always seeking to enhance the role of feminism. She had a great international following, a good friend of hers was Alice Schwarzer, the famous editor of the German female magazine *Emma*.

Johanna Dohnal enjoyed the party a lot, especially the sense of solidarity and cooperation. As some traditions died in the late 1980s/early 1990s like using the greeting *Freundschaft* (meaning friendship), this hurt her quite a bit. Her sense for Socialism was very strong.

In the early 1990s she worked quite well with the Family Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat (ÖVP), cooperating on a grand scale against the beliefs of Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek (ÖVP). Both showed that their mutual interests were stronger than their party divides.

&#x200B;

**Forced out**

With the rise of Jörg Haiders radical right FPÖ in the early 1990s, the winds changed towards a more conservative view. Johanna Dohnal and her programs faced more headwinds in society with the rise of neoliberalism making her work even harder to do, she couldn't stem against the tide much longer.

In late 1994, after another election, Vranitzky and Dohnal talked about her possible resignation. She said that she wanted to resign in late 1995 after the *Zehnjahresbericht* (Ten Year Report) of the SPÖ Frauen and the World Womens Congress in Beijing.

But she was denied to choose the time of her own resignation. On April 6th 1995, as part of a Government Reshuffle, she was forced out of office by Vranitzky. Until the autumn of 1995 she resigned from all political posts and went into private life with her fiance Annemarie Aufreiter, with which she entered a Lebensgemeinschaft (weaker form of Civil Union) in 1981.

&#x200B;

**Later life and death**

Even after politics, she still heavily engaged with feminist topics as well as questions of social and human rights issues. For instance, she was part of the *Frauenvolksbegehren* (Womens Popular Petition) of 1997 \[my year of birth\], launched by the group Unabhängiges Frauenforum (Independent Womens Forum). The petition was signed by 645.000 people (from a population of close to 8 million), a resounding success. From the 18 points of improvement, drafted after the Petition was discussed in the *Nationalrat* (Austrian Parliament), only two of which were realised until 2018.

Although she never attended higher education, she made several lectures on feminism at Innsbruck University as well as the University of Vienna. One of her greatest honours was the title of *Professor*, awarded by the Federal President Heinz Fischer, in 2009.

In January 2010 she entered a *Eingetragene Partnerschaft* (Civil Union) with Annemarie Aufreiter, soom after the *Eingetragene Partnerschaft-Gesetz* (Civil Union Law) went into effect on January 1st 2010. Johanna Dohnal never really spoke much about her lesbian relationship in public, most learned of it when she married Annemarie. She thought that she couldn't bare that on her women as they wouldn't understand it in the 1980s.

The Civil Union was her last honour that she was able to see alive. On February 20th 2010 Johanna Dohnal died aged 71 after long heart complications (she was well known for her chain smoking) in Mittergrabern, Lower Austria. She was cremated and her urn buried at Viennas Zentralfriedhof, close to her female party colleagues and legends Rosa Jochmann and Hertha Firnberg. At the farewell ceremony, a lot of people praised her - in the public the sadness was great. Even her enemies in life showed her a ton of gratitute after her passing.

Annemarie, who still lives, tried to get a widows pension - but was denied as she was united only for a few weeks with Johanna.

&#x200B;

**Honors**

In September 2011, a *Gemeindebau* (Municipality Building) in Penzing was named after her as *Johanna-Dohnal-Hof*.

In 2012, after a decision of the city council from 2011, a park in Wien-Mariahilf (6. *Bezirk* \- 6th Disctrict) was named Johanna-Dohnal-Platz.

In her lifetime, the SPÖ founded the *Johanna-Dohnal-Stipendien* for students and the *Johanna-Dohnal-Förderpreis* (Funding Prize) for scientific works on Feminism. Adding to that, in 2005 she was awarded as *Bürgerin der Stadt Wien* (Citizen of the City of Vienna, an honorary award).

&#x200B;

**Famous Quotes**

*""Aus taktischen Gründen leise zu treten, hat sich noch immer als Fehler erwiesen.""* (Stepping quiet for tactial reasons always proved to be a mistake)

*„Ich denke, es ist Zeit, daran zu erinnern: Die Vision des Feminismus ist nicht eine ‚weibliche Zukunft‘. Es ist eine menschliche Zukunft. Ohne Rollenzwänge, ohne Macht- und Gewaltverhältnisse, ohne Männerbündelei und Weiblichkeitswahn.“* (I think it is time to remind people: the vision of feminism ain't a ""female future"". It is a human future. Without role coercion, without power or vioelnt measures, without male bundeling and femininity delusions)

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

Johanna Dohnal constituted and still constitutes a great role in Feminism and Womens Rights in Austria even today. Her tireless work for a more emancipated society still bears fruits and she is part of a great line of female Social Democratic legends like Hertha Firnberg, Marie Jahoda, Rosa Jochmann and our current party leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner. Her unshaking belief in Democratic Socialism/Social Democracy makes her so special, even now and something I admire much about her.

Personally I have the highest respect for the work and life of Johanna Dohnal and see her not only as a role model for me as a man, but as an idol. Her endless work and idealism, the oppositon she often enough faced, the cool and calmness she retained against all odds is not only admirable, but borders the region of legend for me. Feminism for me has a great role in Social Democracy - as it is not only the emancipation of women in society, but shows one of our foundations, justice and equality. Women can do a lot, therefore we need to strengthen the emancipation until we reach full equality. It is our solemn duty to work for this goal, so we can say one day: no matter the gender, we are all equal in every societal aspect.

And although believe, that I haven't hugely benefitted from her work personally, I am of the conviction that Johanna Dohnal still lives with us and a lot of women in society - as a role model, as an ardent force, as a legend. We, men and women alike, will carry her ideas like a torch into the darkness to brighten it - and her ideals like a flag into a bright future for all! And knowing her successor as *Bundesfrauenvorsitzende*, Eva-Maria Holzleitner, personally, I have the firm belief that the ideas and ideals of Johanna Dohnal will live on with her and generations of men and women forever.

> This focus on the [Professional–managerial class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional–managerial_class), it's very relevant for shows like this because many of us watching, listening and participating are part of it in one way or another. And it's important because it reflects a certain type of politics that, even at it's most well-meaning, negates the fundamental project of solidarity and unity, which is driven by a real bottom-up class politics. Which is essential for the actual work of graduating from capitalism, moving to a post-capitalist world, which is the only way to fundamentally deal with the collapse of all Earth living systems that we are experiencing today as well as reconciling the contradictions between the limits of markets — overproduction, global debt cycles. How many more commons are there really left out there to move into the private market? Well, the ones we have left are extremely dangerous and disturbing. We have human genetic materials and we also have the Internet and the technologies of the future, which have already turned into tools of militarization and mass surveillance. So we need a politics that centers democracy and the commons and is built on true broad-based social bonds.

> And in order to understand some of the different sentiments in place, we need to talk about the difference between sympathy and solidarity. Having sympathy with working people is important, but it's not the same as people having solidarity with one another.

> In fact, the theorist, the father of capitalism himself, Adam Smith claimed that the tendency to admire rich people and despise the poor is the great and universal cause of corruption of our moral sentiments. He understood the moral difference here. He was actually quite persuasive in his moral condemnations of certain types of obscene wealth, even as he obviously was a promoter with massive blind spots around capitalism. In our society we often demonize poor & working class people, and then confuse a sympathy which might run counter to that demonization with actual solidarity. Our politics need to be built on solidarity.

> It's not about pity. In Buddhism, there's actually a brilliant teaching on what's called the ""near enemies"". And these are desirable states that are confused with undesirable states. So as an example, one is equanimity with indifference. Dealing with crisis and seeing things in life and in the world, and dealing with it with some measure of equanimity is great. Having indifference to it is not. Some people confuse that. And they also talk specifically about confusing compassion with pity. Pity is separating yourself from the action, it's fundamentally condescending, it's fundamental distinction making. It is not we're actually in this together in, as an example, a shared class struggle against the capital class.

> Solidarity means empowering people to win power and write their own rules. Fundamentally, a politics of solidarity is about a belief in people in your community and outside of your community. It's a belief in the possibility that we can come together and build a genuinely democratic world in all spheres including the economic one. Building solidarity is not just a question of sympathy, it's something the Left has struggled to do. Too many in the Left aren't willing to do that work. The working class is diverse and dynamic; they aren't going to come prepackaged sharing all of your beliefs, cultural prejudices, and social practices. Solidarity is sharing community with people who by definition are not the same as you in every category.

> Lula was able to build a politics of solidarity and a diverse working class movement in Brazil, which he is reassembling today. And I want to just play some of this clip because it's relevant tonally, and it's also inspiring. Lula is in fact out of prison. And even as Bolsonaro continues to run through wrecking Brazil, destroying the Amazon, pushing through a militant neoliberal and neo-fascistic agenda; the social movements, the leadership, the bottom-up, and a leader that leads from solidarity is out there. And remember this is President Lula before he voluntarily turned himself in for an unjust, corrupt political imprisonment rallying his supporters...

> ... People need to understand Gramsci's concept of the [organic intellectual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci#Intellectuals_and_education), which is really, in some ways, just a reaffirmation of the notion that — which, again, is all too often totally missing from liberal circles in America, and, of course, always under onslaught and con-artistry and war from the right-wing. Which is that working-class people can understand and contextualize their own circumstances. It is not just wrong for people to not understand that, it's fundamentally condescending, and it does not create the necessary politics of solidarity. Gramsci rejected this, and also, crucially, the idea that the working class was incapable of producing their own intellectuals. The job of the Left is to promote and empower members of different groups to produce their own intellectuals and leaders capable of organizing their class against capital hegemony. This is a project that only a politics of solidarity can create, and a politics of PMC sympathy outright rejects. Gramsci wrote ""I'm a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of will."" We need to build a movement that can handle the contradictions and confusions of the modern world steeped in the intellectual traditions that can bring us the necessary clarity. But to also build a world and base our politics on an unshakeable optimism of will. This will only come from a community of solidarity and the interconnected movement that it can build. Sympathy can be a great starting point, but solidarity is the goal.",1642440410.0

EU gave Croatia 5,1 billion HRK(aproximately 678 million euros) to help us deal with the earthquakes.
But, due to the ruling party being the right wing HDZ, which has had multiple corruption scandals and failures throughout its pillaging of Croatia(it ruled for the majority of time since our first democratic election in 1990/1991), we will be losing that amount. EU rules give countries 18 months to spend that money, our government barely contracted anything and spent a miserable 2%.
Meanwhile, people in the areas hit by earthquakes have to await this cold winter without houses. 
The devestating part is that private individuals and companies donated more than the government.
This is one of the many examples as to why the HDZ is a bad party. It will also hopefully finally make the people see that the HDZ does not care for the people, only their own private interests.

# Was Sweden Headed Toward Socialism in the 1970s?

BY[KJELL ÖSTBERG](https://www.jacobinmag.com/author/kjell-ostberg)

Sweden’s extraordinary wave of reforms in the 1970s, an era of explosive radicalism, reveal the achievements — and the limits — of social democracy.

Some see  it as a step to far, a straw that turned the Swedish populace against the sOCIAL DEMOCRATS reformist policies , others see it as that missing link that almost transformed capitalism into a bonifide form of Democratic Socialism

WHAT SAY YOU?

Sweden in the 1970s was the most advanced welfare society that had ever existed. The social reforms implemented during that decade were perhaps the most extensive ever seen. Over a period of ten years, the public sector’s share of GNP grew by 50 percent and a series of reforms vastly strengthened the position of wage earners in the labor market. Most of the reforms now associated with the Swedish welfare state — ranging from the health insurance system and parents’ allowances to daycare for all and free abortion — were initiated or implemented during a few years in the early and mid-1970s, an era symbolized by the radical social-democratic prime minister Olof Palme.

It is impossible to overstate social democracy’s importance to Sweden’s evolution during the 1970s. The social-democratic party had more than one million members, in a country with eight million inhabitants. In the early 1970s, the party had been in power for forty years and held control of most of Sweden’s large cities. It had strong youth and women’s organizations. The trade union movement, in particular the blue-collar workers’ union LO, organized close to 90 percent of the workforce.

Rising dissatisfaction in the workplace among social democracy’s key voters was a growing problem for the party and the LO. One aspect of this was the debate on excessive corporate profits that raged in Sweden in the early 1970s. Another was the demand for economic democracy.

In response, LO decided to appoint a committee led by its chief economist, Rudolf Meidner. Few Swedish books have influenced the social debate more than the modest 120-page document that the committee published in the autumn of 1975. The basic thrust of the text was that every year, a portion of the profits of Sweden’s large and medium-sized companies — in the form of shares — was to be transferred to funds controlled by the unions. It was apparent from a table included in the document that Meidner expected the system to give employees control of a majority of the shares in most companies in somewhere between twenty and seventy-five years. In delivering this proposal, Meidner had three objectives in mind: to give employees a stake in company profits; to attack the growing concentration of power and ownership by creating a new ownership group; and to find a workable form of employee influence through ownership.

The proposal was greeted with great enthusiasm by LO’s members. “Now we will take over,” the metalworkers union chairman declared.",1642199210.0

For me I think a classless society is the logical conclusion for those who support democracy and as democracy requires equality amongst the people.

""I desire a classless society and the substitution of the motive of service for that of competition... Socialists do not propose to substitute the domination of society by one privileged class for that of another. They seek to abolish class distinctions altogether. The abolition of classes is fundamental to the Socialist conception of society.“ - Clement Atlee

Is ethical passive income possible?,Liberal,11,s02oix,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/s02oix/is_ethical_passive_income_possible/,4,"My father is a successful self-made real estate entrepreneur. At this point in his life, he makes loads of money whether or not he works. He uses his extra time to be with his family, exercise, and travel. He donates a considerable percentage of his income to charity. I have a great deal of respect for him.

The other day we were having a discussion about my new wedding DJ business. I shared that I was happy and proud that I'd gotten my first gig using a website and marketing campaign I'd created for myself.

My father responded immediately by reminding me of ""the cash flow quadrant"" and how I need to get away from exchanging my time for money as an employee/worker as fast as possible and become an owner/investor who can earn passive income by managing people or capital.

I do find my father's lifestyle to be very appealing and I would love to get to a point someday where I don't have to work anymore and the money just rolls in on its own (who wouldn't) but even if I could find 100% ethical investments to put my money in that don't exploit people or the environment (that's it's own huge dilemma), a part of me would still feel guilty about getting to kick back and relax while other people still have to work.

I don't take issue with the principle of ""usery"", so theoretically I could work hard, save my money, lend it out at fair rates to worthwhile projects, and eventually make enough money from my investments to stop working. Is this an ethical life path to aspire to and can it be congruent with my social democratic values?

Although the franchise has been expanded, so that now the working class is allowed to vote, there are still many assumptions embedded in the system that makes success difficult for progressive organizations. Basic ideas about taxation, and definitions of property, have not changed much from the 1700s. Because of this, progressive movements are forever forced to fight on terrain that is best adapted for the concerns of property owners. 

I've been thinking about forms of government that would still be democratic but would start with different premises. I'm not interested in yet another re-hashing of ""What was Man really like when living in a State Of Nature?"" We now know that humans are descended from apes, a fact they did not know back in the 1700s. We now know there was no State Of Nature as conceived of by John Locke. That whole conversation should be regarded as not just irrelevant to modern concerns, but completely absurd even in its basic assumptions. 

In our modern system, the working class can vote, but the wealthiest powers can spend millions and millions of dollars on television advertising, brain-washing the working class into voting against their own interests. 

So is there a method of voting that automatically protects against attempts at manipulation? Is there a way to aggregate votes in a way that protects against the risk of a voter being brainwashed in some way? Is there a way to find the true signal, despite a great deal of noise? 

On a modern note, I've been thinking of a system of voting that borrows ideas from Machine Learning, so as to gather up the votes of voters and aggregate them in ways that protect those votes from manipulation. In computer programming, we often need to pull a weak signal out of a great deal of noise. There are techniques that can do this. Likewise, there are systems of voting that can discover voters true needs, even when the voters have been brainwashed to vote against their own interests. 

This is long, but I fleshed out the details of such a system here:

Little is definitivly known about Ho Chi Minh's early years, but he was born in modern Nghe An Province around the year 1890, in French Indo-China. He was the son of a local Magistrate. During the 1910-20s Ho traveld aroud Europe, to France Britain and various other countries, usually under various psydonyms and worked a varity of Jobs on Ships, in Hotels and eslwhere as a cleaner, cook etc. During this time Ho met various Socialists and may have read the Works of Marx and Engels. By the mid 1920s Ho was a Dedicated Communist and Member of the 3rd International, during this time he visited the Soviet Union and China (Hed had to leave China in 1927, following Anti-Communist Purges by Chiang Kai Shek) During the 1930s he retured to China to help advise the CPC. during 1940/41 Ho returned to Vietnam, deturmind to help the country frow off the shackles of Imperialism and expell the French colonialists. The French regime change to a Nazi-Puppet in 1941 (Vichy) and Indo-China was occupied by the Japanese who were just as, if not more Brutal than the Former French controlers of the region. Ho launched a guerrilla campaign against the Fascist Invaders and recieved information and Material support from the Allies (inc. ironically the Americans) this campaign was successful and by 1945 the Fascist Japanese had been driven out of Indo-China.Following this Ho declared the Independence of Vietnam As the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Hoever this declaration was not recognised by the Western Powers who soon supported the return of the French Imperialists. In respounce to this Ho, and the Vietnamese Communist Party called for A general strike. During this time the Communist under Ho also fought against Trotskyist rivals in the south. The French respounce to Vietnamese Resistance to Re-colonialisation was Brutal, Socialists Of All stripes (Marxists, Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists and Anarchists Were Arrested By the French as they tried to regain control) the French also Bombared the city of HaiPhong. these Events led to a Indo-Chinese war of Liberation from the French (the First Indo-China War) after commiting numerous Atrocites, the French were finally defeated by Ho Chi Minh and The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, notably at the Famous battle of Dein Bein Phu, and were Driven from the region, Following peace agrements that ended the war, Vietnam was Partitioned in the Democratic North, And the Pro-Western Capitalist Dictatorship in the South. Cambodia and Laos were also Given independence.

Following the partition, the south Supported by the CIA attempted to Boost it's popularity and discredit the North, but most of the Country still suported Ho Chi Minh and saw him as a Liberator who had led the country to Victory over both the Japanese and the French. During this time Ho's party began a land reform campaign and supported Communist Guerillas of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong) Ho Chi Minh would lead his country during the Vietnam war, But sadly Died before he could see a Communist Victory and the re-unification of the country. Ho Chi Minh died on September 2 1969 at the age of 79. Ho Chi Minh was given a state Funeral, and despite what he stated in his will (He wanted to be cremated) his body was embalmed and placed in a larged mausoleum in Hanoi, where it remains to this day.

Honecker was arrested by the Fascists in 1935 after secretly traveling to Berlin to organise with the underground KPD and distribute anti-Nazi propaganda in the city. He would remain in prison for most of the 30s and forties despite attempting to escape several times. He was liberated by the Red Army in 1945.  Following the end of the war he became a memeber of the newly formed SED party and the head of it's Youth wing. Honecher soon became closely alinged with the party leader (Walter Ulbricht) and a prominent menber of the party. in 1958 he became a member of the Politbureu and was one of the overseers of the construction of the Birlin wall. Honecker would become the Leader of the SED in 1971 and would lead the party and the German Democratic Republic as it's head of state, until the disateous year of 1989, during the 80s friction grew in the SED and beteen the USSR and GDR as Honecker was critical of Peristroika and Glastnose and refused to implement similar actions in the GDR.

Following the collapse of the GDR, honecker, who was in poor health was put on trial by the West for alleged crimes during his tenure as head of the GDR - primarly about the shooting of defectors who had tried to cross the Birlin wall. as the trials dragged on Honecker attemted to claim Assilum in the USSR (which Gorbachov refused) and later Chile (The GDR had taken many refugees following the coup of 1973) Honecker's health continued to decline durng the trial and he was eventually released in 1992, after this he traveled into exile in Chile (his wife had areadly been granted assilum there) where he died in 1994.

In 1963 Bishop left Grenada to go and study Law in England at London Univercity. during this time he also traveled to Warsaw pact countries (Czechoslovakia & DDR) he also read the Works of Marx, Lenin,Mao and the theories of Julius Nyerere. During his time in the UK Bishop was active in the Campaign against Racism (CARD). Following the completion of his studies Bishop returned to Grenada in 1970.

Once back in Grenada Bishop became active in Leftist politics, helping with a nurses strike in 1970. in 1972 The movement Asssociation of People (MAP) was established by Bishop and others, it would unite with the Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education and Liberation to form the New Jewel Movement in 1973. In November of 1973 Bishop was injured in an event called 'Bloody Sunday' where police brutally beat Bishop and other Socialists. Bishop was closely monitored by the Grenadan government during the latter half of the 70s, who attemted to stamp out the New Jewel Movement. In 1979 Bishop and the New Jewel movement statged a Succesful revolution and began to implement Socialist polices as well as establish Diplomatic relations with Cuba. During the Period of New Jewel control illiteracy dropped from 35% - to - 5%, Healthcare was made free and universal and unemployment was massively reduced. 

In 1983 Infighting emerged within the New Jewel movement and Bishop found himslef opposed to his deputy PM Bernard Coard. Coard's Faction, with the support of the Army Placed Bishop under house arrest, this was met with mass protests by the people of the Island. Bishop attempted an escape on October 19th 1983 but was captured by several soldiers of the People's Revolutionary Army, who acting on their own accord, without orders executed Bishop and several other Prisoners before hastely burying them in an unmarked grave. Coard became the New leader of the New Jewel movement, but his time in power would be short lived as the USA used the politcal situation in grenada to Launch an imperialist invasion latter that month in 1983, which overthrow Socialism in Grenada.

Béla Kun (1886-1938)

Bio:

Kun was born jaunary 20th 1886 in the village of Lile, (today part of [Hodod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodod), Romania) to a Proletarian family. in 1904 kun went to Univercity at Franz Joseph Univercity, and during his time there Magyarised his name from its original form (kohn) to Kun. Prior to the First World War Kun had worked as a Journalist, In 1913 he married  Irén Gál a music teacher from Aiud. During WW1 Kun served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was captured by the Russians. during his time as a POW he was exposed to Communist ideas. He was released during the October Revolution, following his release he activly met with and campaigned/fought for the Bolsheviks. in 1918 Kun returned to Hungary and began organising stikes, and promting the Communist Party, which he had been a founding member of, for these actions he was soon arrested by the Social Democrats who now contolled Hungary, following the collapse of the Empire. Once the new borders for Hungary had been annonced by the allies, the poularity of the SocDems Plumited, and the resorted to asking the Communists to ally with them in a last ditch attempt to cling to power, Kun Used this to His advantage and force the Social Democrats to merge with the Communists and accept actual Socialist Reforms. following the Merge of the two parties the Hungarian Soviet Republic was formed (the Second Socialist state in Europe after Russia) Kun began to implement collectivization of farms and unleashed a Red Terror to purge Bougoise and reactionary threats to the revolution. the Hugarian Soviet Republic was short lived, internal discontent due to the Red terror weakend Kun's government's ability to effectivly govern, but what effectivly ended the republic was it's border distputes with neibouring states being used as a justification by the Capitalist Powers to invade - In 1919 Czech and Romanian Troops with the Support of France and Britain Invaded from all sides and overwhelmed the young Socialist state, and Kun was force to flee into exile in Russia. following the fall of the Socialist government Socialist were purged in a White Terror by reactionary forces. 

During his exile in Russia Kun Joined the Bolshevik party and was given an administertive job as governor of part of Crimea, during the Russian Civil war. Once the civil war in Russia was was over, Kun was sent to various parts of Europe to help local communist parties there. In 1921 he was sent to Germany to help organise the KPD and was involved in the '[March Action'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_Action).  Kun would continue to advise Communist Parties in Eastern Europe on behalf of the Comintern throughout the 1920s and 30s. Kun was accuesd of being a ''Trotskyist'' during the Great Purge and was arrested and Shot by the NKVD in 1938.

A Plea For A European Federation,Liberal,48,ruirt3,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/ruirt3/a_plea_for_a_european_federation/,20,"Todays EU has many deep and underlying issues. In this post I‘ll go a but over the history of the EU how it bacame what it is, what its issues are.

*A bit of History*  
The process of european integration started with the ECSC (European Coal and Steel Community).   
It was first proposed in May of 1950 by the french foreign minister Robert Schumann. It was his aim to “make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible”  by creating a common market which would make war impossible. It is important to see that the wounds torn open by the second world war where still wide open, after all the most devestating war this continent has ever seen only ended 5 years ago at that point. To make sure such a catastrophy would never happen again he wanted a common market to sell coal and steel in a free market between the member nations, without any taxes duties or other restrictive practices.    
The ECSC was overseen by a High Authority, a common assembly a special council and a Court of Justice. These institutions would later evolve into the European Commision, The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Court of Justice.   
The ECSC was a model for the European Economic Community (ECC) which was established in 1957 with the treaty of Rome (took effect in 1958). This was another crucial step for European integration alingside the later establishment of other institutions such as EAEC led eventually to the formation of the EU.

*Problems of the European Union*  
The EU has many issues and I will come back to those later but I think it is also important to highlight some of its achievements first:  
\-No war between France and Germany since 1945 (and a long lasting peace in Europe in general)   
\-free movement of people  
\-the Euro (I know there are many sceptics, but the convinince for the individual can’t be denied)  
\-free roaming   
\-Erasmus+   
\-good customer right  
\-good food safety regulations   
and much much more, this is just a small selection for now.   
Now to the problems.   
The EU seems out of touch to many people. A good example of this would be the infamous bill which wich the EC tried to regulate how curved a cucumber can be. This seems out of thouch when you are poor and live of the absolute existence minimum or some other bad situation. (To be fair to the EC, the law actully makes sense as it makes trate easier and such, but it is a *very* easy target for reationaries to point at and say “look how out of touch they are, *die da oben*”.) (most people in the EU still view it positiv)   
Another huge problem is internal division.   
There is no denying that there are massive internal divides in the EU and not only economic divisions but also social once. The economic differences will shink over time. We can already see that the quality of live is impoving across the EU and also in the eastern member states (and now imagen how far Hungary would have come without the massive corruption by Orban and his friends),  
The social divides however are massive, while things such as gay marriage, LGBTQ+ rights etc are lived reality in most if not all western states, the goverments of Hungary ans Poland in specifily are craking down on these rights as much as they can.  
And they are also reducing the rule of law with the massive control of the judichary by the polish government.   
And there are more probles which I wont elaborate on but I‘ll list some of them here:  
\-different foreign polices across the member states  
\-a asylum system that fails everyone how seeks asylum  
\-massive inequlity in living standarts between nations   
\-a rise in nationalism  
\-linguistic divisions  
\-(perceived) cultural differences 

Now to the main part: Why I think that a European Federation would solve many of the problems listed above.   
But first a little more history

*The idea of a European superstate is not a new one!*  
The idea of some kinda of European federal state is not a new one and throughout history there have been many people and times when some form of European federation was proposed.  
In 1814 the essay “De la réorganisation de la société de européenne“ (eng.: The reorganization of the European society).  
Another example of early Eurofederalism would be “Paneuropa“ by Coudenhove-Kalergi but that one was founded on ideas of racism, and other crude ideas.   
In 1925 the SPD released the Heidelberger Programm (you can download it here: [https://www.spd.de/programm/grundsatzprogramm/](https://www.spd.de/programm/grundsatzprogramm/) ) in which they advocated for the creation of a United States of Europe

How a federation could solve issues that the EU is facing  

As eluded to before, the EU has many issues and I belive that a Federation could solve many of those problems. In the following part of this text I will show how a European Federation could solve the problems of the EU.

*-The Eu seems out of touch*  
This issue could be resolved by a EF (European Federation) having a good public broadcast which does a good job of creating transparency on a European level. Furthermore a EF would naturally lead to a greater focus on European politics which would lead to one not only hearing about how the EC wants to ban to curved cucumbers but also the more “down to earth” politics of the EU   
*-Internal division*   
This is a problem could be solved by a fed. government that can actually do something about member states doing things they are not to  
\-*differnt foreign policies*  
This would not be a problem with a common European foreign ministry   
\-*messy asylum system*  
This would be fixed because member states could not anymore ignore their moral and legal duties  
\-*Differences in standards of living*   
A federal government could take proper care of the poor across Europe. It would also have the means to ensure the money ends up where it belongs and not in the pockets of some rich oligarchs.   
*-a rise in nationalism*  
A creation of a EF would certianly help to foster a European identity but it would also lead to the voices of nationalist that want to go back to Europe of nations. I honestly don’t think there is really a solution to that but to wait until these voices become quiter and less. Programms like Erasmus are already helping to foster a European identity and more and more people are feeling European.  
\-*linguistic differnces and barriers*   
I don’t think this is too much of an issue most young people speak English these days. A EF could make an effort to ensure that older people also learn english with free courses and such. And ofc everthing could be translated into all the official languages as it is already being done in the EU.  
\-*perceived cultural differences*  
this is a big one, I think. Once cultre and traditions are an intement part of once personality. I think a EF should try to preserve the unique cultures of the Union.

In addition to those problems being either not that bad or solved by a EF, we must also consider that an EF would give Europe strategic independence from the US. And that is quite important since the us have become an unreliable parter which was most recently shown by the American troop withdrawl from Afghanistan. We should also consider that Donald Trump could very well be reelected US president in 2024 and that would be devastating to the EU and democracies around the world. And not to forget that the US democracy is slowly erroding away (which is something we social democrats should do our best to stop) and that fascism is on the rise. 

So that are some of the points why I think that a European federation is a good idea, even inevitable  in the light of Russia and China becoming stronger and the US no longer being a reliable ally on the world stage. To be able to live how we want to, have a self determent future, to hold up our democracy- To do that we need to be one strong voice, one federation. The fight for a truly united Europe isnt a new one, but it now is more than ever a fight worth fithing. For Europe. For us.

How to convince my boomer parents of global communism?,Liberal,4,rt52sc,alltheleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/rt52sc/how_to_convince_my_boomer_parents_of_global/,3,"Hi, I am trying to be more open with my parents as a result of my therapy. Part of my frustrations lately have been with arguments I seem to get in daily with my parents over communism. They are boomers, born in 59, not very political, but they occasionally watch Fox sometimes which is....anyway they have threatened to kick me out and cut me off from their credit cards because of my beliefs. I read theory, and am heavily involved in community organizing, but they keep saying that I should have grown out of this already and that a ""real world job"" would make me think differently. But they can't get it through their heads that they are so enveloped in white consumerist proto-colonialism and cis-patriarchy that they are blinded to the plight of workers globally. I tried to calmly explain to them the basics and they always shut me down and resort to personal attacks, and lately the threats of kicking me out for living with them at 36 is making me contemplate another suicide attempt. 

TLDR, my boomer liberal parents don't want to listen, is there a simple book that would be ok for them to read to at least START to understand communism?",1640990208.0
"Socialism exists only when people receive profits/money. When charging, everyone is a capitalist.",Liberal,0,rryn7o,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/rryn7o/socialism_exists_only_when_people_receive/,3," 

So maybe some people have already thought about what I am about to say. But I have never personally heard anyone use my argument against socialism.

Workers/socialists these days keep saying how the profits belong to them and they hate capitalism. And I have seen people like Ben Shapiro defend capitalism and offer counter points like the business owners deserve the profit because they invest money and take all the risks etc.

But what I realized is that in reality, there is no such thing as a socialist. Everybody is actually a capitalist. Here's why: Lets say a company makes phones that cost them $50 to make. Then they sell it for 500$ to make $450 profit on each phone. **Now the 'socialists' claim this profit belongs to them. But the irony is, such a big profit exists only because you charged customers like a capitalist!**

I mean, why would a socialist charge 500$ for something that costs 50$ to make? That's capitalist pricing technique. A socialist would have to sell it for 55$, which means there won't be any profits to share in the first place.

Thus friends, it brings me to the realization that **there is no such thing as a socialist. People are only socialists when receiving money; when charging, everyone is a capitalist.**",1640859935.0

So I know that this sub is mainly soc dems and dem socs, but I honestly think you guys can get on board with this too. Will post in other subs as well.

So, the whole idea of a market socialism is that the workers own the companies they work at. I like that idea for a lot of reasons, but one very common criticism is that these coops may have trouble with funding. I have spent a great deal of time thinking about this issue and I have come up with several solutions. I have discussed three of them elsewhere (bond market, credit unions, and crowdfunding) but now I have an idea that I think even a capitalist would agree would work on a large scale.

Here it is:

So the issue that a lot of coops are trying to solve is the same that I have with capitalism: the right to absentee ownership. Basically, the idea is this: If a capitalist buys some machine and hires a worker to work on it, the capitalist can take some of the money generate by the worker so long as they own the machine (the worker doesn't get full value of labor). It would be fair for the capitalist to be compensate for the cost of buying the machine, but not have profits from it forever. If the worker ever says ""hey, screw this, I don't want to send excess money to the guy sitting around doing nothing"" then the capitalist can use police or the state to reclaim their property. Essentially the worker is forced to work at a lower rate than what they provide.

This is the key problem with capitalism (for me at least). We could argue about that issue, but that's not the point of this post. The point is my solution. So if the issue is permanent private absentee ownership, wouldn't it be ok if the coop sold a futures contract based on some preferred stock (non-voting stock representing some ownership of the firm and entitlement to profits). Basically the idea is this: A futures contract is a legal entity wherein an asset is agreed to be bought or sold at a particular price at a particular time. So what if the futures contract was tied to preferred stock (meaning the coop would buy back the stock at a given price and time). This would allow temporarily allow trading of stock in the coop. It would not be permanent, as it is time limited, and, because the workers are the ones writing the deal, they would set it up so that the value coming from trading the stock at that time is greater than any cost, thus ensuring no worker exploitation (they're not gonna try and exploit themselves or undersell themselves, they want the highest price possible).

In short, you basically have a stock market that's actually based on futures contracts based on preferred stock. Right now, many coops have investor members and owners of stock, and others sell preferred stock, so this could be built on already existing systems.

Though some extended family and many doing their own research in their news trough (feed) would assume I've joined a terrorist organization, as starting fires, looting, damaging property, and doing all the illegal parts of the insurrection on 1/6 is what is reported. Have also heard BLM called a cult, protests all described as riots and looting. When standing with an elderly group of people from the church next to me for a flash stance on sundays holding signs saying BLM, no justice no peace, white silence=violence, say their names, reform the police, the church supports BLM and some just saying love with a <3, we'd get flipped off, many yell all lives matter, a few obscenities and white lives matter.

Maybe I'm just hopeful and naive but there has got to be a way to break the hateful stereotypes and childish tantric rhetoric. It's so difficult to have a rational conversation when both parties think the other is getting false or misleading news, being controlled by fear and can't agree on facts.

They have worked behind the scenes funding think tanks, corporate media, and likeminded politicians, quietly and subtilty undermining democratic institutions, unions, and politicians NOT likeminded, such as Henry Wallace, JFK, Paul Wellstone, JFK Jr., Bernie Sanders, et. al.

The past 20 years have seen increasing acceleration of their activities. Their minions, after all, were the ones to remind us not to let crises go to waste. The chaos following 9/11, the financial collapse of 2008, and now Covid, all under the watch of increasingly incompetent administrations and petulant legislators. But even before this, we can go back 50 years to the Opec Oil Crisis of the '70s, Vietnam in the '60s or the Red Scare of the '50s. Every crisis resulted in the silencing of alternative voices and cries for stronger leadership.

The media was deployed to actively steer thought and debate away from real solutions towards pragmatic analysis. The '70s became a turning point. The opening provided by the American ""failures"" of the Iran Hostage crisis, Three Mile Island, the Vietnamese boatlift, the Oil Crisis begat a media howl for 'strong' leadership that led the election of Ronald Reagan. (Note that I put failures in quotes, because while each of the incidents mentioned were bad, they weren't earth shattering, and in following years worse event would take place that would receive far less attention by the media.)

Since Reagan, the American people have been squeezed and pushed and bled and are about to succumb to the machinations of the rich. The rich, the elites, the economic royalist, the corporatist all had focus and determination and unity of purpose. They knew the game was afoot while we were distracted by the corporate media and reality TV and YouTube influencers. It sucks, but they have played 3-dimensional chess while everyone else was just living their lives.

Now, some 90 years later, the plot that was thwarted in 1933 is about to succeed at the ballot box. Nobody, well, too few anyways, is awake to the game. And the ballot box certainly won't provide a remedy.",1640030084.0
A theory regarding social democrats and why some radicalize and some don't.,Liberal,15,rjrjry,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rjrjry/a_theory_regarding_social_democrats_and_why_some/,32,"**This theory was probably once already discussed and thought of, I just interpret it this way.**

With the now very exposed wrongdoings of the top percent of class, such as tax evasion, exploited workers, underfunded government programs, and how it effects the working class and economic policy shown, many feel that the current system in which it allows the private ownership of the means of production and the privatization of essential goods and services, has instead of being the bastion of freedom and democracy, become the system where greed and want is the perfect breeding ground to  thrive. This has pulled some previous moderate social democrats to realize that the current capitalist system even reformed in some ways isn't enough and that we need to make sure it withers away. Now on the other hand, people have entrusted themselves into the system of private ownership for basically forever as we have been taught by the failures of previous ""socialist"" revolutionary nations and the stability and freedom it guarantees. This is why many are skeptical of ""socialist"" movements in the US for instance. The very system that we had built up is now hated by many and ready to be abolished, which scares the mainstream. I mean cant we just have our hand in the market and have welfare programs and everything will be fine? Well, I have another take. No system is perfect in any way, every single one is flawed in some ways. As technology and societal norms progress, a systems drive, like a machine, slowly breaks beyond repair. Just like how feudalism was replaced by a newer device, mercantile capitalism, and how mercantile capitalism was replaced with modern capitalism, some including myself now believe we need to replace the current device. The current device is beyond repair now.

Edit: After re reading this, I feel as if I presented social democrats as mostly third way neoliberals. I still feel the argument applies to most people but I may be wrong.",1639898457.0

I see social democracy as a good way to transition to my ultimate goal of libertarian market socialism coupled with a strong welfare system (like a state). Basically I want swedish welfare, Rojava style politics (i.e more power delegated to communities) and market socialist economics. I see social democracy as a very very good system, but one that can be improved on by removing the capitalism and ultimately transitioning to market socialism (I know a lot of us support worker coops). I guess that makes me more of a classical soc dem.

I don't consider myself a Marxist, but it's always important to keep an open mind so I have been reading a lot of marxist stuff and talking to a lot of proper marxists recently. One thing that has consistently come up as a criticism of capitalism is this: the crisis of over accumulation as laid out here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2h7NWpyfkE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2h7NWpyfkE)

from 5:20 to 7:02.  


So, I personally think market socialism has an answer to this (mainly because higher profits means more pay to workers, so the wage issue can't happen thus preventing the crisis in the first place), but I am curious as to how social democracy would solve this issue.

Marx argued it was inevitable in capitalism, but clearly something was off there because the Nordic states handled what was effectively a crisis of over accumulation a lot better than more capitalistic states like the US or UK in 2008 (though I could be wrong). Is there a way of preventing this from occurring at all?",1639355894.0
How does universal childcare work in a Social Democracy?,Liberal,41,rf1szl,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rf1szl/how_does_universal_childcare_work_in_a_social/,6,"Hello all, I know that the general consensus here is that The Jacobin is not the greatest paper for opinions, but they did a great analysis showing the failures of the USA democratic push for universal childcare.

In short, the democratic plan calls for free childcare for those who make below a certain wage and a deductible for people that make slightly more and then full price for those making over a certain salary. 

The problem is this is expected to lead to an increase in childcare cost and certain people will be tasked with paying for the entirety of the cost.

Don't understand the hate towards scabs,Liberal,0,recpci,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/recpci/dont_understand_the_hate_towards_scabs/,16,"A scab, also known as a strikebreaker, is an individual worker who is hired by a company during an ongoing strike. The ability of a company to hire scabs gives the striking workers less bargaining power, as the organization may not have to cede to the strikers' demands due to the operation being at risk of falling apart.

As you can imagine, unions don't like scabs. Socialists and social democrats alike hate scabs, since they are viewed as betraying their fellow workers. 

Our social democratic party in Canada, Jagmeet Singh's New Democratic Party, even proposed banning the use of replacement workers in their 2021 election platform. So does the Communist Party of Canada, a ""communist"" party with an aggressively socdem election platform. 

I don't understand all the hate for strikebreakers, and I don't understand why some socdems want to ban them outright. 

If the scab worker voluntarily enters into an employment contract with the company and wants to render their services, why does the government get to stop them from doing that? It seems like a gross overreach by the state and a violation of basic economic freedoms. If Jimmy the forklift driver wants to accept a job at a Kellog's plant, why should the strikers picketing outside get to coerce him into not taking the job because it undermines their interests? After all, if the pay and working conditions were that awful, Jimmy would probably end up joining the union or not working at Kellog's at all. 

I wholeheartedly support all workers' right to organize and strike. I also support the right of all workers to seek jobs wherever they feel like working, and of private entities to hire anyone willing to work for them. If the workers have the right not to work, the scabs should have the right to work and employers should have the right not to hire.",1639268869.0

The CCP, is a highly centralized powerful institution within China, and I think it's pretty hard to deny it is very authoritarian and not even close to communist (not that I'm a communist, just saying that the CCP is very much not). As such I am very opposed to many of the policies and actions of the CCP, such as the genocide of the Uyghurs, the occupation of Tibet, the crackdown in Hong Kong, restrictions of civil liberties at home and support for dictatorships abroad (see North Korea). It's authoritarianism is spreading, whether we like that or not and we need to have a coherent policy around the CCP.

I don’t know if I‘m a social democrat or a democratic socialist,Liberal,5,rayf5c,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rayf5c/i_dont_know_if_im_a_social_democrat_or_a/,15,"Hi there, so I was told in one discussion that I‘m a social democrat. I did a political spectrum test and I landed in a still liberal but comparably conservative and definitely socialist corner. Looking at the stances of the parties here in Germany I‘m overlapping with the left (die Linke). I personally think that the SPD is too lax.

I personally see no desire or moral good in capitalism - but I do acknowledge that it’s pretty effective in generating goods and services and especially wealth. But the individual freedoms of economic freedoms and owning property are - despite their general importance - not as important as the well-being of society as a whole. I personally don’t care for real-estate property rights if people are sleeping on the streets and market approaches failed so far.
For me with capitalism is like with a nuclear power plant: you want to get as much energy from it as possible while keeping the fuel rods cold and prevent a meltdown under all circumstances.
I think that redistribution of wealth is a legitimate thing to do in order to ensure real democracy and basically follow the approach of the government being in the position to make as much „profit“ of individual wealth as economical feasible to offer as best services for the common good as possible, and rigorously stepping in the market when the market fails the common good - this may include seizing land and means of production. So I’m for high taxes that are within the sweet spot of the laffer curve and for as much institutionalised democratic participation in companies as possible.
If there was a practical feasible different economic system that would ensure wealth for all better than the current system I‘m happy to introduce it, but as long as the world sticks to capitalism, I think we should work with what we have.
This sounds to me like classical social democracy, but the social democratic parties here (SPD) really don’t seem to work in this direction. Just the left offers policies like 70% rich tax, wealth tax, expropriation of messed up markets. But on the other hand they want a hybrid system of private capital to a certain degree and state socialism on a more macro level, what’s in the generalization not what I think is the best way (although I think much more tasks should be fulfilled by the government or non-profit agencies than it’s the case today).

The GOP has a new ideology and what is terrifying is that it is bottom up and not top down. I have perianal seen many GOP voters itching to be able to attack/kill liberals and leftists as part of this ideology (not saying they all are, but I have seen increasing calls for violence, lethal violence, in the right with my own eyes). This new ideology has been fully embraced by Tucker and other Fox News hosts and others. It's called illiberal democracy and tucker flat out endorsed the leading proponent of it: Viktor Orban. It is authoritarianism with the veneer of democracy. You still have elections, but they aren't usually representative of popular will.

Living wage & exploitation of work force,Liberal,173,r0rqsd,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/r0rqsd/living_wage_exploitation_of_work_force/,18,"Bit of a rant...but I'm just tired of it all. 
I'm mid 30's and my husband is late 20's. My husband and I both have bachelor's degree, we have 2 kids (15 & 13 yr old), and live in Ohio. We both work full time. 

Back story: My degree doesn't help at all (political science), and my husband graduated end of 2019 (mechanical engineering). I had a good paying job, but I refuse to go back to that career field (sales/management). And yes, we have tried to find better paying jobs, but most wouldn't even contact us back (even after interviews)...so we are still looking, but we've HAD to find jobs to live.

 I make $16.30/hr and he makes $17/hr. It's insane how anyone can live on min wage. Min wage in Ohio is $8 something/hr I believe. Living wage for family of 4 in Ohio (with both parents working) is a little over $20/hr (each). 

We are struggling with having anything more than necessities & bills...examples: car pymt, car & health insurance, chiropractor (my last job wrecked my back), gas, rent, electric, food, utilities, credit card, medical bills, and saving a little for Christmas...oh and student loans start up again in Jan...fun... 

It's to the point that my 15 yr old is considering quitting sports to get a job to help the family. He doesn't have his permit yet... mainly because I doubt we can afford the extra car insurance. I'm too scared to even know how much the cost of car insurance will jump up. 

In the end: I know I'm not alone...but when will this exploitation of the work force end? We need living wages in order to keep the economy going.",1637714075.0

Addressing Housing Affordability in Bangladesh,Liberal,19,qzrcwd,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qzrcwd/addressing_housing_affordability_in_bangladesh/,3,"I recently read an \[article by the Daily Star about affordable housing in Bangladesh\]([https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/affordable-homes-all-1813060](https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/affordable-homes-all-1813060)).

&#x200B;

Although I support the Daily Star's mission to provide more housing to our fellow countrymen, I disagree with some of their proposed policies. Some of the policies I AGREE with include -

&#x200B;

 \\- Developing cities and towns outside of Dhaka

&#x200B;

 \\- Decentralising the housing market via better public transport and rail network.

&#x200B;

 \\- Reducing registration and construction costs

&#x200B;

 \\- Digitisation of land rights

&#x200B;

 \\- Financial support for the homeless

&#x200B;

However,   I disagree with providing tax incentives/subsidies and cheaper mortgages to homeowners. I have lived in Australia for more than 5 years and this is the strategy that was employed by the governments of the last few decades. Although this temporarily increases the homeownership rate, it makes housing increasingly unaffordable since you're increasing the demand without addressing the supply issue. The strategy has cost the government a lot of money and has actively resulted in a housing crisis across the country. This \[video \]([https://youtu.be/zBQkYlMOiAc](https://youtu.be/zBQkYlMOiAc))by Australia's public broadcaster illustrates this problem very well.

&#x200B;

The video also mentions a policy that was enacted by Robert Menzies,   Australia's Prime Minister in the 50s, which was actually more successful. This wasn't focused on providing cheaper loans to first-time homeowners, but instead, the government building a lot of housing and then selling them at a low cost. This resulted in the highest ownership rate (i.e. 70%) in Australia, which has never been replicated by the succeeding administrations.

&#x200B;

Here are some of my proposals for addressing the housing problem in Bangladesh -

&#x200B;

 \\-   Tax incentives/subsidies and cheaper loans to property developers to   incentivise them to increase the housing stock in the country

&#x200B;

 \\- Land value taxes, in order to prevent land hoarding and incentivise the efficient use of land

&#x200B;

 \\- Vacancy taxes, to punish people who hoard housing and don't rent it out to people.

Israel must pull out and end their occupation of the west bank. To do that however, they will need assurances that the west bank wont become another Gaza strip. For Palestine, they need to know Israel is negotiating in good faith and will return East Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital before evacuating settlements. Of course, steps such as leveraging certain supplies to Israel in order to force them to the table will have to be made, but by showing that the US progressive movement, or at least a part of it, recognises and supports Israel's right to exist as well as the Palestinian right to exist, the left can actively help bring peace while still not in power.

As a part of unemployment insurance, the proposal is for Unemployment Insurance to pay overtime pay to any worker who works more than forty hours is any given week if they do not collect that pay from any employer.

These workers, that regularly work part-time for several employers, loose a protection that full-time employees enjoy: overtime pay. 

Many regularly work more than 40 hours, but never earn a cent of overtime pay, because they work for several different employers. Under this proposal, that missed income would be compensated by unemployment insurance at their average pay rate for the week.

Want to help end the two-party system? Make elections actually fair to third parties?,Liberal,96,qnyfc8,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/qnyfc8/want_to_help_end_the_twoparty_system_make/,12,"Would you like to end the two-party system? So would I.

Most  Democratic Socialists want to vote for a Democratic Socialist, but  often times we need to align ourselves with the Democratic party in  order to get our interests heard and have any say in an election. The  reason for that is due to how we vote. Most elections in the U.S. only  allow voters to choose one candidate at a time. A large number of  elections also only require the winner to have the most amount of votes  at the end of the race (a plurality), not even requiring over 50%. This  is how we end up with the two-party system.

One way forward to ending the two-party system is with STAR Voting:

[How Does STAR Voting Work? (3 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-mOeUXAkV0)

With  STAR Voting, you can support multiple candidates! This means being able  to support a Democratic Socialist and even a ""safe"" candidate that you  think is more likely to win. So long as you express yourself to the  fullest, STAR Voting will let you have a say in the final automatic  runoff. If more progressive ideas are going to advance in the future we  will **NEED** to change how  we vote. And anyone can support this. You can talk about this to the  most conservative people you know, because at the end of the day, *a more expressive ballot and more democratic election process helps everyone*.

&#x200B;

FAQ and Additional info:

Why not Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) ?

Ranked  Choice Voting, also known as Instant Runoff Voting, has some flaws that  make it a bad choice for a very polarized society such as the U.S. is  now.

* RCV fails the Monotonicity Criterion:
   * A fancy way of saying that if enough people change their vote to rank a candidate they like higher, *they can actually hurt that candidates chances of winning.*
   * Here is a 3 and a half minute video that briefly goes over this: [How RCV betrays your favorite candidate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtKAScORevQ&list=PL9SZtOdm2FYTmVVOcRKu885muJ-viHT3f&index=4&t=1s)
   * And here is a 9 minute long video that goes into a little more detail: [Voting Paradoxes | Exploratorium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJag3vuG834&list=PL9SZtOdm2FYTmVVOcRKu885muJ-viHT3f&index=5&t=1s)
* RCV exhibits the Center Squeeze effect:
   * Candidates  that would normally be compromise candidates are eliminated first, and  more extreme and polarizing candidates are allowed to win.

   * &#x200B;

Do I need to score everybody on the ballot?

No!  You can vote for as many or as  little people as you like! Your ballot also won't become exhausted and get thrown out if you give someone the same score.

&#x200B;

How do I know I can trust this method?

For that I would suggest reading this article [https://www.starvoting.us/accuracy](https://www.starvoting.us/accuracy) on the STAR Voting website, and take a look into Voter Satisfaction Efficiency (VSE), which compares the quality of election methods: [http://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic/](http://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic/)

&#x200B;

Is it possible to actually pass this? 

YES! Chapters exist around the country: [https://www.starvoting.us/chapters](https://www.starvoting.us/chapters) and you can read more on the STAR Voting website on what makes it constitutional and nationally viable.

&#x200B;

You think proportional representation (PR) is the only thing that can help combat the two-party system?

Well, lucky for you, a PR version exists for STAR Voting, named STAR-PR! You can read more about it here: [https://www.starvoting.us/star-pr](https://www.starvoting.us/star-pr)

Question for Norwegian social-democrats,Liberal,63,qjoqcd,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qjoqcd/question_for_norwegian_socialdemocrats/,13,I am writing an article about recent victories of social-democratic parties in Europe and I was wondering what caused the victory of the Norwegian social-democrats.

Question for market socialists here (but others are welcome to jump in too!) What do you think of my model of worker ownership?,Liberal,11,qha9t9,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qha9t9/question_for_market_socialists_here_but_others/,2,"Hello,

So I was having a discussion over on r/cooperatives where I raised the issue of founder incentives.

Basically the issue is this:

A common criticism of market socialism from capitalists is that ""You're free to start a coop in the free market, if they are so great why aren't there more""

There are two reasons: 1) Lack of investment incentives and 2) lack of founder incentives.

The first is easier to solve: Crowdfunding, bonds, credit unions, etc.

The second is harder. Because starting a firm take a lot of time, labor and energy. Oftentimes firms are not profitable for years. But in a standard worker coop, the founder doesn't get any additional kickback for that work. So why would they bother to found it? That's where my idea comes in:

You could do a multi-stakeholder cooperative like this: [https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/](https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/)

But i understand that is unpopular (every time I mention this idea on r/cooperatives i get downvoted to hell).

So I have another idea (and it would prob be ok for software I think, which is the industry I plan to work in). 

Use an EOT and have it own like 90% of the firm, and then the founder owns the 10% of the rest, with it written in the bylaws of the company that this 10% may not be sold to anyone outside the firm/other than the workers and that it cannot be passed onto to anyone else. When the founder stops working at the firm, they will lose ownership of the 10% and it is given to the workers. To leave the firm, the entrepreneur sells the 10% to the workers, transferring all ownership to the workers. The founder can still get paid quite well, and is compensated for their initial work, their idea, and risk. The founder must keep working in order to keep the stock, and if the entrepreneur wants to sell to the workers at an earlier point, they can. The ownership will end up 100% in the hands of the workers, however the founder gets a nice kickback and an extra share of the profit for the risk, initial work, and the idea, and thus are fairly compensated.

What do you think of this idea?

My only concern is that by retaining that 10% the founder may be able to exploit workers by taking more value than they produced, but if that is the case I guess the workers could buy the stock or vote to kick the founder out of the company, at which point they'd be forced to sell anyways. So I don't think that is likely.

Thoughts? Thanks!",1635379780.0

"Swiss healthcare system vs the USA, is it worth attempting to implement and additional questions",Liberal,7,qcp1g1,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qcp1g1/swiss_healthcare_system_vs_the_usa_is_it_worth/,7,"I should start this by saying I think a single payer system is far better, and cheaper, but nonetheless, the Swiss system is still superior to the US system. (EHCI in 2018 reported it was the number 1 healthcare system in Europe, although I know there are flaws with their methodology, but this does point to the system being good), and based on the current healthcare apparatus in the USA, the Swiss system would be most feasible to achieve universal coverage while hopefully one day pushing towards a Nordic or NHS type system. 

I believe the ACA (aka Obamacare) was attempting to implement a Swiss like system, and I’m aware of some large holes, I.E, insurance companies in the US being FOR profit, whereas in Switzerland they cannot be for profit, and the US, under the ACA, allowing insurance companies to spend up to 20% of  premiums on administrative costs and advertisements (whereas I believe if I remember correctly, about 92% of premiums in Switzerland go to cover medical expenses.). Side note, this is one of the largest criticisms of ACA because it affects how much insurance companies can earn, so they find a way around this impediment by finding more expensive healthcare because 20% of say 1000 USD is greater than 20% of 500 USD, and the difference is made up by increasing premiums. 

About 11.5% of GDP is spent on healthcare in Switzerland whereas it’s about 17.6% in the USA, almost 53% more, and the care is comparable. Additionally, the care is universal, which I know the ACA attempted to do with the mandate, but nonetheless, medical coverage would still be way to expensive for some in the USA. 

So I guess my overall question is what can we in the US learn from the Swiss system? What’re it’s major faults? Is it a system worth implementing? 

Additionally, because I could not find it elsewhere on the internet, are private insurance companies in Switzerland required to cover all emergency services and hospital expenses (besides of course some copay & requiring a deductible): as in, in the US, if one goes to a hospital that is “out of system” an insurance company can refuse to cover any of the expenses (this can lead to an otherwise insured person to become financially destitute if they say have a medical emergency while on vacation or are unconscious and an ambulance takes them to an “out of system” hospital.",1634813338.0
Politician and CEO pay,Liberal,7,qc6s66,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qc6s66/politician_and_ceo_pay/,11,"I think the Covid pandemic has brought an issue back up to the foreground, pay for the economic and political elite versus the pay of the poorest classes.

Even during a pandemic, while the lowest classes tend to suffer the most, pay for CEOs tends to go up, and I barely ever hear pay for politicians going down to compensate for the crisis.

To combat this I had a set of ideas for pay for work that places people in the position to decide over other people's lives as much as politicians and CEOs do. I think for politicians it's pretty clear, they should earn the average income that leads to similar buying power as the lower and middle economic classes in their country. This should incentivise them to improve the situation for these classes.

As for CEOs, I think the bare minimum when it comes to pay should be that CEO wages may only increase as much, percentage wise, as the average rise of wages of the rest of their workforce. This doesn't fix how much more they make already, but it should help better divide the profits of the company across the workers and management. This policy should also try to deal with the obvious holes like the worth of shares and bonuses, otherwise it's pretty pointless.

(I don't think these policies should ever be implemented just on their own, since they don't address all the major issues, just specific ones.)

A page summarising polling of the last 90 days: https://www.dkriesel.com/_media/sonntagsfrage_90tage.png

Three weeks after the federal election, all signs indicate the future government to be a social liberal ""Traffic Lights-Coalition"", led by the SPD, with the Greens to their left and the FDP to their right.

According to Forschungsgruppe Wahlen [ https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/politbarometer-ampel-scholz-kanzler-corona-schnelltests-100.html?slide=1631192701216 ], one of the most prestigious survey institutes in Germany, over 60% of germany favour this kind of coalition, while only about 20% are against it. The Union is weaker than it has ever been, dropping below 20% in most polls due to internal fights and scramble for power.

The three parties have been talking to each other for a while, and recently released a first paper about their goals for the upcoming legislation. It does seem a bit FDP-dominated in some areas, but overall, i'm pretty happy with it and hope most of it gets realised.

-

*What you can expect:*

The main focuses of this coalition would be:
-protection of the climate
-modernisation in all areas
-securing of pensions 
-reform of the welfare state and improved social security 
-development of the infrastructure, especially public transport
-digitalisation
-lowering of high rent prices and building more housing
-increasing equality for women, minorities and citizens of the states of the former GDR
-education
-debureacratisation and incrased cooperation between states and federal government
(+an election reform will happen in the upcoming legislation period, mostly to limit the size of the evergrowing parliament)

-

*On foreign policy:*
Not much would change.
Slightly more hawkishness, slightly more europeanism, potentially slightly decreased transatlanticism. Moreso if the Greens get to lead the ministry of foreign affairs, they really don't like Russia and China. 
They also want to protect refugees, not only in germany but also on their way to europe. The number of people dying on their way too europe and in the Mediterranean shall decrease.
(If Cem Özdemir [ https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cem_%C3%96zdemir ] somehow got to lead the ministry things might get chaotic for our relations especially to turkey. That will not happen though.)

-

*The paper, results from the first talks between the three parties:*

One interesting thing about the paper is, that instead of a ""Social Market Economy"", they called the economic system they want to make laws for a ""Social-Ecological Market Economy"".

Another notable thing was Germany being called a ""modern immigration hub"". Things will be made easier for immigrants and especially refugees. 

-

*MAJOR POINTS OF THE PAPER:*

-quicker exit from coal, possibly already in 2030

-immediate minimum wage raise to 12 euros

-lowering of energy prices, mostly by removing a form of taxes on energy

-lowering of minimum age for national and european elections to 16 years

-replacement of Hartz IV [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartz_concept ] with so called ""Bürgergeld"" (""Citizens' Money""), giving more money to poor people and making it easier for unemployed people to get back into work

-pensions are not to be lowered, the age of entering pension planned to stay the same

-no general speed limit on Autobahns will be implemented

-private healthcare insurance will not be removed, the current mixed system of private and public insurance will be kept

-the care-sector will be strengthened 

-taxes are not supposed to be raised

-tax benefits for innovation, especially in climate protection and digitalisation

-national debt brake will remain intact

-400k flats per year to be built, a quarter of it state-aided/state-funded

-solar panels on new commercial buildings MANDATORY, solar panels on most new private buildings

-2% of Germany's area to be designated for wind-turbines

-

*Other interesting points:*

-investment in digitalisation, especially in public organisations and institutions, digitalisation to reduce bureaucracy 

-investment in fast internet to improve Germany's horrendous situation in that area

-improvements to be made in the law for protection of the climate

-bureaucratic hurdles in the building of renewable energy sources to be smallered, increased possibilities for communes to benefit from renewables in the area


-invest more in structurally weak areas, especially the former GDR

-more and better ways to fund private retirement planning, including a state run investment fund


-bureaucratic hurdles for all kinds of start-ups and innovations to be smallered, increased support and funding by the state

-cutting of economically or environmentally unnecessary or detrimental spending

-increased funding for childcare and education

-debureaucratisation to build more housing

-making it easier for desperately-needed skilled labourers to immigrate to germany


-combat left- and right-wing extremism, antisemitism, radical islamism, racism, and anti-queer-action, as well as every other form of human-rights-violation

-increase equality of women, people with disabilities and minorities

-add a ban on discrimination based on sexual identity to the constitution, remove the word ""race"" from the constitution 

-changes to the law for transsexuals and the law for families


-encourage innovation

-fight tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering (as well as corruption)


-call for European countries to engage in fewer wars and focus less on military, decrease weapon exports

-support Israel

-

*What wasn't mentioned in the Paper:*

-The legalisation of marijuana was not mentioned in the paper, but is likely (pretty much guaranteed) to happen, as both Greens and FDP want it, while SPD aren't explicitly against it. Most likely, it wasn't mentioned because it will be rather easy to meet a consensus on this topic.

-Before anyone asks: nuclear energy was not mentioned in the paper, because there are no debates about it in Germany anymore - and please, do not spam comments about how you hate Germany for this or whatever, there have been enough threads about this topic for now, and not every post about Germany has too devolve into a fight about nuclear energy.

There is much more content to the paper, but i will not go over the rest of it since most of it is not that relevant and also because the exact agreements are not yet finished. I might give an update on this once the coalition contract is finished - if it gets finished. I am highly confident it will happen though.

Do note that of course not all of this will be realised. For some of these things, the constitution would have to be changed, requiring a two-thirds majority. 
I am also a bit disappointed that ways for the government to fund their spending were not mentioned much, other than cutting some spending, immigration, and making it easier for start-ups and innovation to have success and boost the economy.
For the rest however, i am hopeful that at least the vast majority can be realised without too many fights, finally ushering in a new era of a social-liberally ruled Germany, almost 40 years after the last such coalition ended.

Man here asking a question.,Liberal,7,q8ezmg,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/q8ezmg/man_here_asking_a_question/,16," So I recently read about toxic masculinity and I'm a little confused about what qualifies as necessarily having toxic masculinity. From what I've gathered  these behaviors center around the ideals of violence and being brave as well as competition. My question is, to what extent does that apply? Do I have toxic masculinity simply because I enjoy violent content like video games and movies? Or because I like characters like Duke Nukem and the like? If I were to say something like ""Damn, man, you got some balls."" After he does something crazy, does that play into it? Or if I strive to compete with others in a game?

Or, is it more something to do with how we lock those traits behind ""This is something only men can do""? Does liking these things necessarily mean you have toxic masculinity, or is toxic masculinity more centered around saying that you HAVE to like these things or you're not a man?",1634266181.0

I started watching the first vid (from like 8min in because the link automatically goes there, lmk if that was a mistake) and it's clear that they are conflating their criticisms of the new pride flag from a visual standpoint (thinking it looks ugly or a unnecessarily complex is ofc a valid opinion) with the legitimacy of the pride movement itself

They think that the pride flag isn't needed, and therefore anyone who uses it is self centered and arrogant. The premise that they state directly is that lgbt people are doing just as well as non lgbt people and don't have any major discrimination

Anyone who looks at data would know that lgbt people still face increased rates of discrimination, violence, and social stigma and rejection. Literally the fact that most lgbt people still have to worry about how to ""come out"" to their family and friends, fearing anything from rejection to outright violence, is enough to justify people using whatever pride flag they like

They're trying to convince their audience that homophobia doesn't exist anymore and thus pride is useless or bad. But they don't bring up any data or reasoning behind their personal opinions of it being fine in the UK

Then they talk about the rapper, while doing so they imply that children who are too young to do xyz, can just cut off their genitals and change their gender

In reality, rarely does any trans child under 18 go through any kind of surgery. And if they do, it would only be after a medical doctor extensively observes the child and their records and finds it medically necessary for their mental health

And that only happens if the doctor is sure the child understands their decision completely. But that happens very rarely

But people like Sargon Akkad or whatever his name is want you to think that a 7 year old can just walk into a doctors office and demand a same day sex realignment surgery

In reality, it's more like a 16 year old talking to multiple doctors for years and everyone coming to the conclusion that the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks

The rest of that video is honestly just bad comedy ""haha trans people can't have kids but they'll try to get half the world"" or something like that.

Last thing about that one: straight pride isn't necessary neither is a straight rights campaign because no one is going after the rights of straight people. Is there any political group trying to reduce the rights of straight people? No, but there are many who try to make discrimination against gay people legal.

They outright reject that people rn are campaigning for lgbt rights because they think, for whatever reason, that lgbt rights aren't being threatened and lgbt people don't feel uncomfortable. Both are wrong ofc

2nd video

Okay they're hyperfocusing on one argument they disagree with so far

So people were saying that the shooter was racist because he chose to target a place where mainly Asian people were. Their argument is that since the shooter didn't say he had racist motivations that it's crazy to believe the shooting had anything to do with race. If someone shoots an Asian restaurant and then claims ""I just wanted to shoot a restaurant"" you couldn't blame people for thinking that there are more motivations given the location he chose. Or if someone shoots a black church only to claim ""I just wanted to shoot a church"" then you wouldn't blame people for assuming he still had other motivations.

Even if you disagree with people who say that we have to assume race was a motivation given the context of everything but the shooter's words, you can't just blame people for disagreeing with you or think they're crazy.

Wait the murderer first targeted an Asian spar and then drove 27 miles to shoot another Asian spar?

C'mon, they can't possibly think it's crazy for people to think he is racially motivated

They really think that unless the shooter explicitly says it's about race then it's unjustified to say race was part of it?

Subconscious bias exists for one, oh and he could have been lying. Racial terrorists tend to be treated harsher in court and prison than a random shooter.

Literally if they just thought for longer than a minute they'd figure this out.

It fits their narrative that people pay too much attention to race. That's the only reason why they are criticising people who say it definitely was racially motivated so much. They want their audience to think ""oh so people claim racism when there isn't any"" when it comes to other problems too.

Then they talk about the model minority myth. They mention how Asians on average are performing better than black people on average despite also having had systematic racism. They claim Asians are doing better because of cultural values and then dismiss the idea that slavery is still affecting black people

The systemic racism that black people had to deal with was and is completely different than Asians. And yes, centuries of slavery is actually a good example. They must think that all discrimination is the same, no matter the type or duration.

Third video:

So kids show is basically saying ""families with two dads, two mums, or two non-binary people and any sexuality can be happy"" and that's a bad thing? The show seems kinda boring to me but like I'm not gonna make a video and complain about it being bad lmao

Also, asexual people are accepted in the lgbt community because many asexual people think that there must something wrong with them or their lack of sexual desires may affect their mental health by affecting relationships or whatever, so ofc the lgbt community should be accepting. The lgbt community is about being happy with your sexuality, and asexuality counts.

""agenda"" lol I love it when they use that word cause the agenda is just accepting people for who they are. If I had a nickle for everytime they use that retoric, I'd be a billionnare by now.

Okay now he's saying that pride is forcing labels onto children and making them ""pick a box"". No.... It's about letting everyone know that if you are gay/lesbian/trans/whatever that it's okay and you should feel happy.

If some gay child thinks that something is wrong with them, they might be helped by their cartoons saying ""it's okay to be gay""

People like him think that if we wouldn't mention lgbt stuff at all then no one would feel bad. But our society is heteronormative (the norm is to be straight) so children might be confused if they don't feel heterosexual and we know as a fact that children who are lgbt face more difficulty accepting themselves.

And LMAO, he just said that it's a undeniable fact that the ""cultural forces"" want kids to be gay. That's just so ridiculous. Pride is about accepting people who are lgbt \*because\* many people want them to just be straight.

He says young people don't have a sexual identity yet, well what if someone gets bullied at school because they have two dads? Or because they like to dress differently or whatever. Why does this guy have such a problem with messaging that is literally just ""be proud if you're lgbt or have lgbt people in your family""

I'd love it if this guy pointed out where and when the videos said or even implied that you shouldn't be straight. Notice how these people never talk about anti-lgbt violence or discrimination? It's because they want their audience to think that all this pride stuff is for nothing

Also why would there be such a massive effort to turn kids gay? Like who is doing this and why? There is no monetary or strategic advantage gained from that. His conspiracy theory doesn't make any sense because even the simple question of ""what would anyone have to gain from that"" can't be answered.

"Trump, Russian trolls, and the Arizona “fraudit”",Liberal,28,oigao1,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/oigao1/trump_russian_trolls_and_the_arizona_fraudit/,1,"All over Reddit, paid Russian government disinformation trolls are defending the fraudulent Arizona recount. Often, their defense is subtle — “let it play out”, “Trump lost and can’t be reinstated, so what’s the harm?”, “if you didn’t commit fraud, why are you afraid of the recount?”, “how is it fraudulent?” And we know that Putin’s piglet (what the Russian media calls Trump) sees this “fraudit” as his last hope. The fact that Russian trolls are so ardently defending it shows that Putin, too, sees it as his last chance to get Trump back in or, at the very least, to cause widespread violent unrest in the country.

Please write to your Congressman and Senators expressing your concern and urging them to press the DOJ to take action. If the Trumpist/QAnon firm conducting the bogus Arizona “audit” succeeds in altering enough ballots to falsely claim Trump won Maricopa County, Republicans all over the country will force the same procedure in every state Biden flipped and very well might take to the streets with even more violence than on January 6. This farce needs to be stopped now!

Just to recap about the “recount”:

1. ⁠AZ elections officials, including Republicans, conducted several recounts and found no discrepancies. They certified the vote as accurate. So, this is just grandstanding and a political power-play. 

2. ⁠The company Cyber Ninjas doing this farcical recount has no experience in such a thing, were hired by partisan Republicans, and are headed by a man who is a declared Trumpist and a Q anon adherent.

3. ⁠There is no oversight

4. ⁠It is illegal for non elections officials to handle sealed ballots

When this first started, those doing the recount had blue pens with them, which are totally illegal to have near a ballot as they can be used to alter a ballot. A judge had to stop that, but it was not until time had elapsed.",1626050093.0

"All cultures of anti-intellectualism such as the Dixie South and Most Recently ISIS terrorists are all written up by Intellectuals (or at least people who received some education). So despite what leftists argue, education will not fix ignorance because the very same brainy freethinkers create them.",Liberal,2,ohhgzd,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/ohhgzd/all_cultures_of_antiintellectualism_such_as_the/,7,"One of the things that is so circlejerked on the internet that it makes me nauseous is how backwards cultures such as hardcore American Republicans and Arab Muslims and esp the various ideologies and doctrines that are often so full of racism and other hateful bigotry like the Lost Cause narrative, traditionalist Catholicism, radical Wahhabi Islam, and Brexit........... Were all drafted up by intellectuals or at least people who received varying degrees of education.

It was German scientists that created the Nazi racial science and in turn they took these bigoted beliefs from stuff that was being taught in universities across Britain and America. The Lost Cause revival was basically formulated by Southern historians and other scholars (who were often direct descendants of Confederate soldiers). The hate towards education by American rightwingers? Go see the sources that indoctrinate this propaganda....... Major journalists and various rich educated people often controlling various publishing companies. Hell Trump perfectly embodies this as he graduated from Ivy League and look at all the hateful ideologies he spreaded. For almost 1000 years it was priests of the Catholic Church who were the most revered people of Medieval Europe and coincidentally they were also the most educated strata of people during that era. Look how long Europe was backwards and how stupidly superstitious peasants and other commoners were.

But the best example in recent times? Go see ISIS. Practically everybody at the top of the organization were all people who had masters or PhDs (hell some even taught in universities not just in the Middle East bu even in the West years before). Below the top oligarchy, many folks who occupy the upper tiers and mid upper tiers were scientists, doctors, and other people who worked very complex white collar jobs requiring years of education.

Simply put it was college graduates who organized ISIS in the first place.

So its very naive of leftists esp SJWs and libertarians to believe education is the key to brush off anti-intellectualism because it was freethinkers who created stuff such as the Nazi Party and feudalism in the first place. American Exceptionalism didn't just pop out of thin air and neither did a bunch of illiterate blue collar morons workers in Germany suddenly just start hating Jews because they lack logic and had low IQs. Its often brainy people who start pioneering ideas such as ""white people are superior to all blacks and any white man who has a drop of POC blood is not white and thus should be hated"" or British Imperialism and Queen Victoria's right to rule all over the world.

If anything educated institutions are responsible for creating ideas such as women being forced in the kitchen because the Bible says so (which priests at universities were teaching in the Middle Ages under authority of the Vatican) and French nationalism schools in Paris were emphasizing how France was the most glorious country during the 19th century).

So if Americans suddenly became intellectual readers, it won't end stuff like racism nor will Brits be convinced that the UK should rejoin the EU if every person in the UK got educated enough for a B.S. degree despite how SJWs, libertarians, and other leftists love to shoutout in their echo chambers as they do anti-conservative circlejerking.",1625918642.0

Like, yesterday, I was in a debate with a capitalist, and I was highlighting that we, including me, are in a privileged position and can never hope to fully understand the daily struggles of the laborours, workers and the lower classes. We gradually went on to the topic of underpayment. The capitalist guy had the audacity to say, that it was the fault of the lower classes which had led to their own downfall. He literally made a totally insensitive statement that the lower classes were incapable of handling money, and that the struggles they are facing are caused due to the ""fact"" that they were spending their money on phones and TVs while not using that money to buy food or other ""necessities"". First of all, poor people dont do that. They aren't idiots to buy phones when they dont have enough money for other necessities. Second of all, u cant expect the lower classes to live with the bare necessities and live like primate humans while all others move on to an age of tech and development. Thirdly, in this era, tech is, or should be a necessity. Look at this pandemic. In a lockdown, schools move to an online mode of schooling, and the few children of the lower classes who had been managing to go to school will be forced to stop, just because of the fact that they dont have the phone, laptop, etc to attend the online classes. So, we cant stick to the bare necessities we formed a thousand years ago. As times change, so do the necessities. The same necessities remaining the same though times have changed, is like relying on a horse solely for transport, in an era where there are trains, cars, etc. Fourthly, what do we understand about the physical and psychological struggles that the lower classes have to go through each and every day? We cant be ignorant of that fact, and look at everything from a privileged point of view, and say that we have truly understood, or can feel what the lower classes have to go through on a daily basis.",1623924018.0

Along with another nice girl who will be secretary (she’ll be logging our hours and taking attendance in meetings). Me and my friend have big hopes for the club. Though I enjoy the discussions we have. Me and my Vice President are really hoping to find new ways to make feminist club fun and interesting and actually have more than a few members. 

This year the average meetings consisted of making group PowerPoint slides about a discussion topic (some type of social justice issue, which often never included womens rights/issues, but still important social justice issues) and just talk about it in the meeting. Sometimes people didn’t really have much to say or maybe didn’t feel very comfortable to turn on their mics. There’s weren’t a whole lot of attendees in the meetings, I’ll admit I skipped some myself, because they could get pretty boring and it starting feeling like homework having to make slides on the group PowerPoint. Just wasn’t the best atmosphere, I mostly blame it being online.

I’d like to focus a bit more on feminism and women’s issues, while still including discussions on other social justice issues. And I have ideas for fundraisers with some of my favorite charity’s. Maybe feminine hygiene or food drives. And also maybe team up with our schools GSA for some meetings/events. But also how can we make it fun and enjoyable for members? And draw members in and keep them engaged in the club? It’s difficult for us to think of ways to make a club that focuses on such serious issues fun. Next year we can do in person meetings so hopefully we can get more participation. 

Overall, I would really love some feedback on ways we could make the meetings more fun and interesting. And some fun event ideas. Really any advice on how we could improve the club and keep a good amount of members engaged would be so appreciated. Thank you!",1623901306.0

I've been calling elected officials, but it's hard to keep track and to know what, to say, but I found something that helps.

We, as citizens of this country,y have an obligation to let our elected officials know what we want them thinks We even need to call Joe Manchen outright and let him know that if he thinks that Republicans (who have outright said that their purpose is to make sure no Biden agendas get passed) are going to suddenly will back 20 years and 'work as bipartisan players' he needs to get with reality.

With Trump now going around the country making speeches as THE LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT, and former generals talking about a Miyamar style take over,  things in this country have taken a further turn down madness we can't just complain to each other.  Things can get really, really ugly in a way tgatmakese Jan 6th looks like a lovely picnic.  The human psyche shuts down when bad things start happening. It's how the Nazis got into power.

HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN EASILY DO.

2-5 min a day M-F to keep our democracy.

(Or pick one day a week to spend 10 min calling about a few issues important to you)

Go to www.5calls.org 

Choose 5 topics (or more if you want)

There are a list of issues and a script if you want to use it.

It gives you who to call and the number to dial on the issues you choose.

Installing the app 5 calls makes it even easier

A few issues from this week?

Break the filibuster

Enact voter protection 

•Support George Floyd Policjng reform

•Raise the Minimum wage

Etc


Make it part of your daily routine, one of those five things you do every morning without even thinking about it:
1. Wake up.
2. Brush teeth.
3. Walk dog (or stare at the cat).
4. Make coffee.
5. Call Congress.

It is impossible to overstate just how much power you have by making this simple, quick DAILY CALL. Politicians freak out if they get just 10 calls on an issue. Imagine them getting 10,000! Holy crap – the dome will pop off that building!

NOTE: if you’re saying to yourself, “I don’t need to call because my rep is a Democrat!” — that is NOT true. 
They need to hear from you. 
They need to know they have your support. Don’t believe it? 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren voted in favor of Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development! I’m sure no one in Massachusetts thought they had to call.

To make it easy go to www.5calls.org every morning (or just do it all on one day of the week)

"Dark and Light Beauty- Female Archetypes, Meanings/Realities (and the portrayal of how their roles need to be changed)",Liberal,13,kcm3ks,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/kcm3ks/dark_and_light_beauty_female_archetypes/,3,"Throughout fiction and history, there's been a major contrast between two 'types of women'. (Granted there are obviously more, but this is focused on the two mentioned. There's a conflict not just between the two personally (usually) but also a conflict between their deeper meanings and how a woman could/'should' be. And these archetypes don't refer to skin tone (though it's ironic some characters from either type may have at least one physical trait associated with the title (ex. hair color).)

Light Beauty- A character who presents that form of 'innocence' or 'purity', deriving the position as the 'good girl/woman'. She is dependent on others whether or not she likes it or realizes it or not. Being 'submissive' and 'obedient' are also part of what makes this character the way she is. Stories of her trying to shed or keep her 'purity' are one of the major conflicts in the plot. This entwines within how girls will sometimes try to remain 'pure', with this usually if not always meaning sex. From having this emplored by those who raise her to be this way so she can be 'moral' and 'pure'. Also dressing modestly or being sure not to question/oppose authority or to make herself being the authoritative figure. People will often 'speak for her', trying to keep her the way they want her to (usually by men, but sadly other women do this as well). She is pushed to be meek by those in her environment as she can remain pure and to make sure she doesn't become an 'undesirable', 'heathen', or any/all of the degrading terms used to describe women who are liberated (especially sexually), etc. She is 'respected' but not desired.

Dark Beauty- A character who is the opposite of the Light Beauty (obviously). She is independent, worldly, a woman with perhaps some semblance of power, and not under the command of any man. For this she is portrayed as 'wicked', that she doesn't conform to society's rules (specifically a patriarchy's) and that everything that makes her what she is immoral and/or unholy. She gets what she wants/tries to get what she wants through different means: sexual, manipulation, will, or violence. Stories portray her as a woman who defies the 'will of the people' (usually sexist/misogynistic men and women who are indoctrinated/forced into that way of thinking) and must be stopped from getting what she seeks (and is often 'stopped' most of the time/all the time, with it ending up with her imprisonment or death). Women who enjoy and seek sex, wish to have some kind of power/authority in the world, and/or want to be free of controlling rules (about any or all of these things) set by their parents, husband, family, etc. are linked to this trope. She is desired, but not respected. They are called all the degrading and horrible terms women have been and are stilled called to this day. (Sub archetypes of the Dark Beauty are the Femme Fatale, the Witch, the Vampiress, and the She-Wolf/Werewolf which I discussed in another post.) They are also examples of women who the worst of men use to 'justify' their belief in not trusting women and to control women. 

Relationship between the two: The Dark and Light Beauty are very much opposites. One is sexual and free, while the other is conservative and obedient. One is usually depicted as older than the other and presents the more worldly and experienced energy. This does not mean the other will see her as such. The Light Beauty is said to envy or emulate the Dark Beauty, but so many stories present it as her despising her. The Light Beauty perceives the Dark Beauty as what her upbringing has warned her not to be: rebellious, sexual, self-interested, immoral, etc. And with how these stories go, the Dark Beauty may envy the Light Beauty's innocence or will have disdain for her (which is portrayed as villainous). She may try to 'save' the Light Beauty from becoming like her, that she may stay 'pure' or try to rescue her from her innocence (though this usually is very rare and often goes with the way of her being wrong about what the Light Beauty should be). 

For Change: Given for how long the 'role' of the woman has been depicted to be/should be that of the Light Beauty and that the Dark Beauty is an abomination to be weeded out is just another example of the attempts/means to keep women 'under control'. The Light Beauty isn't necessarily bad in herself for not having knowledge of the world, not having acted on ones' desires, etc. isn't bad. Yet it doesn't mean it should be put on a pedestal or something that be used as an example to hate those who don't follow that path. The Dark Beauty has been the victim and unfortunate scapegoat of patriarchal/woman-hating individuals to try to manipulate women into being that of the stereotypical Light BEauty: obedient, submissive, and under control. For a woman to be liberated (sexually and intellectually), to seek and obtain her own power/authority, to rebel against those who would seek to control her and other women, etc. is aspirational. Desire is something we all have, in any and all forms. With these two archetypes, it tells tales both fictional and nonfictional of what some believe women 'should be and not be'. But to portray the Dark Beauty as someone women could/should be and for the Light Beauty as women once were/a warning of what to not always be. (For the Dark Beauty is liberated and the Light Beauty isn't...and women should be free.)

(I hope this was a thought-provoking and meaningful analysis/suggestion of two defining female archetypes and personalities. That and how the nature of women's desires isn't evil and that to act on them/embrace what you all want is something freeing and empowering. Let me know what y'all think and stay safe.)",1607904194.0

Anyways, I'm having ( as well as lots of other people) this issue that is mentioned in the title. This is gonna be a long post so excuse me. 

Since I was a kid my father would drive near bars that had ""attractive"" women outside to attract customers. He would tell me to check them out and sometimes rate them. 
Along with pornography and other similar incidents/habits these things have made it really hard for me to stop objectifying women. The first thing that comes to my mind when I'm seeing a girl on the street or wherever is to tell if she's beautiful or not. If I'd like to have sex with her or not. And other disgusting things about her body. 

When I went to college, some friends that I made were feminists so that's when I actually came in contact with feminism as well. The girl I'm with has helped me immensely with this issue but still. Deep down I just can't seem to be able to get these things out of my head. Thanks to her I have stopped watching porn but I'm still having issues with ads appearing on my feed and with the women I come across on the street. This is causing terrible issues to our relationship. Her trust has plummeted and her self esteem as well. And it's all my fault. 

But I just can't seem to be able to help it. I am not using this as an excuse but merely as a way to show you how I feel. It's like being an addict. It's a cheap thrill. Small doses every time. It's literally the first thing that comes to my mind and although we have been to the brink of ending our relationship a few times due to this  shit Im still having trouble. 

Reading articles and personal experiences about patriarchy and all that comes with it has done little to nothing. I'm really desperate cause I feel sick everytime I have such a behavior.

*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

Workers Vanguard No. 971 7 January 2011

In Defense of Marxism and Science

When the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace went to present a copy of his treatise on celestial mechanics to Napoleon, the latter is said to have stated: “M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.” Laplace replied, “I had no need for that hypothesis.”

Two centuries later, any American politician caught on tape saying something like that would never be able to run for dogcatcher, let alone the Senate or presidency. The U.S. is peculiar among the advanced industrial countries in its level of religiosity—over three-fourths of respondents in an AP poll said they believed in angels. Worse still is an increase in the rejection of scientific thinking, from the millions seeking miracle cures from a panoply of snake-oil vendors to a politically cohesive and dangerous sector of religious fundamentalists out to turn the U.S. into a theocracy. I am not referring to the demented followers of Osama bin Laden. I am speaking of the Christian right, which has abortion and evolution as focus points of attack.

In the Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels state: “The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.” Well, we have a ruling class that could be described as drunk with power. The collapse of Stalinism in East Europe and the Soviet Union in 1989-92 was a world-historic defeat for the working class of the world. The American bourgeoisie declared the “death of Communism,” and even the “end of history.” With military power far greater than any of their imperialist rivals in Europe or Japan, the U.S. rulers have acted with little restraint on their predatory desires, as in Iraq and Afghanistan and recently in Haiti.

At the same time, the consciousness of the proletariat has been thrown back so far that even advanced workers and others involved in social struggle no longer identify their goal as building a socialist society. In the U.S. in particular, there is the question of race: black oppression is the bedrock of American capitalism; the notion of black people as being inferior, which survives to this day, was the ideological counterpart to black chattel slavery. America is if anything more segregated than 25 years ago.

Especially since the September 11 attacks, the “war on terror” has been used to beat the working class into submission and squelch opposition to the predations of U.S. imperialism across the globe. It is not just the linguistically challenged George W. Bush—Obama was made Commander-in-Chief in part to give the image of U.S. imperialism a needed facelift. But smoother words have not changed American military rampaging in Iraq and Afghanistan, nor the extension of police-state measures at home. The American ruling class sees no reason why it cannot continue to literally get away with murder.

In these circumstances it is no wonder that religious reaction is ascendant and even the rationalism of the Enlightenment of the 18th century is under attack. You don’t have to be a Marxist to oppose things like creationism, but without a Marxist program you have no way out of the impasse in which society finds itself. Society is rent by class struggle, legal and extralegal, as the bourgeoisie seeks ever greater profit from the exploitation of labor and workers resist. As Marx showed, there is a fundamental contradiction between the private ownership of the means of production and the further advance of productive forces. The rule of capital must be smashed by the working class, organized and led by a revolutionary Trotskyist party.

Part of the process of building that party is to educate the proletariat as to its historic role and responsibility for the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. That means a Marxist understanding of society, and that in turn means an understanding of the work of science and its defense against the purveyors of mystical and medieval rubbish. So first we have to review a bit of history.

The Middle Ages and Renaissance

The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 to the birth of Leonardo da Vinci in 1452 (or the victorious siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks a year later) marked about a thousand years. That’s about one-fifth of the entire history of human civilization since the first example of writing (the cuneiform tablets of southern Mesopotamia from about 3000 BC). In West Europe this period is called the Middle or Dark Ages. Not coincidentally, the dominant political and economic institution in this period was the Roman Catholic church. Along with the nobility, the church was a major landowner. The vast majority of the population was made up of serfs tied to the land of their lord, to whom they owed service as a feudal obligation. Illiterate, disease-ridden, all but slaves to their temporal and spiritual masters, the peasant masses faced, to quote Thomas Hobbes, “continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short” (Leviathan [1651]).

The Renaissance, which began in the city-states of northern Italy and was spurred by the growth of trade with the East, helped engender a new class of merchants, later to become the bourgeoisie of modern capitalism. As these merchants’ ships went further out into the world, they needed better knowledge on the workings of the natural world and the cosmos. In his 1883 Introduction to Dialectics of Nature, Engels succinctly notes:

“The main work in the first period of natural science that now opened lay in mastering the material immediately at hand. In most fields a start had to be made from the very beginning. Antiquity had bequeathed Euclid and the Ptolemaic solar system; the Arabs had left behind the decimal notation, the beginnings of algebra, the modern numerals, and alchemy; the Christian Middle Ages nothing at all.”

The church dogma on what we would call astronomy was what Ptolemy wrote in the second century AD. In his system, the Earth formed the center of motion, around which the Sun and planets rotated. The stars were fixed on a celestial sphere further out from the Sun and planets. What was on Earth was corrupt; what was in Heaven was perfect.

What passed for medicine also came from the Greeks, in particular, Hippocrates, in the 5th century BC. Human health was determined by the interplay of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile). Ill health meant an imbalance of the humors, which could require purging or bloodletting. These and other often fatal remedies continued to be used in the 18th and 19th centuries: George Washington himself died most likely as a result of bloodletting by his doctors when he fell ill in 1799.

In the 1500s, things started to crack for the feudal order and especially for the church. The Protestant Reformation is normally tagged to 1517, when Martin Luther posted his 95 theses on the cathedral door in Wittenberg. This doctrinal split would lead to no small amount of bloodletting not intended for medical purposes—for example, the Thirty Years War (1618-1648). Rather more unnerving to the feudal structure was the Peasant War in Germany, beginning about 1525. The same Martin Luther wrote a pamphlet on this occasion titled “Against the Murderous and Thieving Hordes of Peasants.”

Galileo was born in 1564 to a noble—but not rich—family. Like many children before and after, he was taken to church by his parents, and evidently the sermons were as boring then as now. Unlike other kids, he made some good use of the time. He observed the great chandelier in the church, which would swing when disturbed by a breeze. He timed the swings using his pulse and found that the period was independent of the amplitude of the oscillation. That’s now Physics 101, and laid the basis for the first accurate clocks based on pendulums.

Galileo was above all a keen observer and experimentalist. When he heard that spectacle lenses were being used in Holland to view distant objects, he immediately constructed a crude telescope. Spurred by the results, he worked out his own procedures for grinding lenses to the exquisite tolerances needed for higher magnification, and produced a relatively small 20X to 30X telescope. He viewed the Moon, and saw not a perfect luminous disk but a place with geologic features just like the Earth—mountains, valleys, plains. When he looked at Jupiter, he saw little stars nearby seeming to move across the planetary disk. He immediately realized these were moons. Subsequently he observed Venus and saw it go through phases like the Earth’s moon.

These observations shattered the Ptolemaic model of an Earth-centered system and convinced Galileo that Copernicus’ idea that the Sun was the center of motion was in fact correct. For publishing this belief, Galileo was tried by the church in 1633 and, not surprisingly, convicted of heresy. Threatened with torture by the Inquisition, he recanted and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. From there he wrote his Mathematical Discourses Concerning Two New Sciences and had it smuggled out of reach of the Vatican to Holland, where it was published in 1638. His observations on the motions of falling bodies anticipated Isaac Newton’s synthesis 48 years later.

Why did Galileo recant? One answer is that he was scared by what happened to Giordano Bruno, the itinerant ex-priest who supported Copernicus’ idea about the Sun at the center, and much else. He was accused of heresy, imprisoned and tortured for seven years during his trial and finally burned at the stake in 1600. And the man who had ordered Galileo to abandon Copernican ideas in 1616 was the same Cardinal Bellarmine who sent Bruno to the stake. From what I have read, it is unfair to say that Galileo was a coward. First, Galileo’s book, giving very thinly veiled support to Copernicus’ theory, had been published in 1632 and already had circulated throughout Europe. Second, he had no substantial religious differences with the church on matters of theology, so a refusal to recant would mean torture and death for no real purpose.

Giordano Bruno was another matter, and it is very doubtful whether his recantation would have saved his life—he actually offered to partially recant in an appeal to the Pope. Just to give you an idea, here are a few of the things with which he was charged: 1) erroneous opinions on the Trinity and the divinity of Christ; 2) belief in the reincarnation of souls in new bodies, human or animal; and (the kicker) 3) denial of the virginity of Mary. There are not a few Christians who would roast poor Bruno today for that! You can imagine how well it went down with the Pope in 1600.

Science and the Industrial Revolution

Following Galileo, Newton produced his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Along with Gottfried Leibniz, he also invented differential calculus—the mathematics needed to solve the problems of moving bodies with forces such as gravity acting upon them. In biology, Carl Linnaeus introduced the systematic classification of animals and plants, based on form and structure. And in 1785, the Scot James Hutton laid the basis for modern geology and showed that the Earth had to be much, much older than the 6,000 years deduced by Bishop James Ussher (1581-1656) from a study of the biblical sources.

The middle to late 1700s was a period of tremendous advances in science and technology, driven by (and pushing forward) the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. Science was held in high esteem by the rising entrepreneurs, and in the growing manufacturing city of Birmingham there arose an informal grouping called the Lunar Society, which coalesced around 1765 and lasted about 30 years.

The name came from their routine of evening dinner meetings on the Monday closest to the full moon, a practical idea since many had a trip of several miles on horseback to their homes, and there were no streetlights. That would change—one of the Lunatics (as the Society members jocularly called themselves) was William Murdoch, who was developing the production of gas from coal to use for illumination. Other notable members included James Watt, inventor of the condensing steam engine (which made steam power practical and efficient enough for its later use in locomotives); Joseph Priestley, the preacher and chemist credited with the discovery of oxygen; Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles and an evolutionist; and Josiah Wedgewood, chemist and mineralogist who made a fortune by making fine ceramics and pottery. Benjamin Franklin was a corresponding member—he was celebrated throughout Europe as an eminent scientist for his work on electricity.

Politically the Lunatics were pretty progressive for their day. Many had favored the colonists during the American War of Independence and also supported the revolutionaries in France. In fact, on 14 July 1791 they were having a dinner in Birmingham to celebrate the second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille when the inn was threatened by a mob howling “Church and King!” The mob’s main target was Joseph Priestley, whose support for the National Assembly won him an offer of French citizenship. Priestley’s house was set on fire by the mob, but fortunately he and his family escaped. They later emigrated to the U.S.

It is literally inconceivable to envisage something like the Lunar Society today. An approximation would be for the heads of U.S. Steel and General Motors to have joined with the leading professors of MIT and Harvard to sign a petition supporting Fidel Castro in his struggle against the U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship in Cuba in 1958!

The Lunatics mirrored capitalism in its youth, breaking down the barriers of feudalism as part of the practical struggle of the marketplace. Capitalism did bring a large increase in the productivity of labor and a corresponding vast increase in the amount of goods produced. Some of this trickled down even to the working class, whose labor created the surplus value pocketed by the capitalist as profit. However, exploitation of the most brutal fashion remained the lot of the masses, and the next economic dislocation causing a reduction or cessation of industrial production would (and did) throw the workers on to the street with no means of support. The scientific unraveling of the basis of capitalist production and profit was presented in detail by Karl Marx in his work Capital in 1867. But the core of Marxism—dialectical materialism—had been enunciated 20 years earlier in the Communist Manifesto.

The Science of Marxism

In his 1883 preface to the Communist Manifesto, Engels wrote:

“The basic thought running through the Manifesto—that economic production and the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently (ever since the dissolution of the primeval communal ownership of land) all history has been a history of class struggles, struggles between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social development; that this struggle, however, has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class (the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the class which exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without at the same time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation, oppression and class struggles—the basic thought belongs solely and exclusively to Marx.”

For the first time, the study of human society and its development had been given a firm scientific and materialist foundation. It is not surprising that Marx and Engels immediately appreciated the significance of Darwin’s Origin of Species, first published in 1859. The astounding variety of animals and plants in their myriad shapes and forms were not static sculptures made by a divine Creator, but had evolved from a common ancestor and differentiated over the expanse of geologic time. As Engels said in his 1883 speech at Marx’s grave:

“Just as Darwin discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means of subsistence, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.”

The philosophical scaffold of Marxism is called dialectical materialism. Materialism, meaning that the world exists in reality; it was not created within the realm of the human mind. Dialectical in the fact that the essence of our world (indeed our universe) is matter in motion. All things exist not in stasis but in a process of development. An analogy is the difference between a still photograph and a motion picture. We know this almost by instinct when we look at plants and animals—consider the bud of a cherry tree, from emerging green speck in spring to flower to tasty fruit. But from birth in a class-divided society, we are made to accept the idea that the social structures and norms of human relations are essentially static—there are rulers and ruled, usually with God blessing the whole arrangement.

The genius of Marx was to apply the dialectical materialist method to the study of society and economy. In a 1914 piece titled “Karl Marx,” V.I. Lenin quotes Engels, adding his own interpolations:

“‘Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern natural science that it has furnished extremely rich [this was written before the discovery of radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements, etc.!] and daily increasing materials for this test, and has thus proved that in the last analysis Nature’s process is dialectical and not metaphysical.

“‘The great basic thought,’ Engels writes, ‘that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made things, but as a complex of processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away…this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things…. For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendency from the lower to the higher. And dialectical philosophy itself is nothing more than the mere reflection of this process in the thinking brain.’ Thus, according to Marx, dialectics is ‘the science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and of human thought’.”

The Dialectic of Science

Scientists seek to be as objective as possible, to eliminate systematic errors and to require that facts be established by experiments which can be repeated by others to confirm the results. Theories are built upon testable hypotheses, which lead to more experiments and further refinements of existing theory or creation of a new and better one. Science has its own dialectic—it is not static, but ever-changing. It is also materialist. Nature and her workings are to be explained using natural causes. Things happen for physical reasons, not the whim of a Zeus, Yahweh, tree spirit or water nymph. On one side science, on the other superstition, and ne’er the twain shall meet.

Any human activity such as science is subject to error, sometimes conscious, sometimes not. The human brain is very good at finding patterns. This was selected for by evolution. Our ancestors did not have the luxury of extended observation time to determine whether that shadowy figure in the grass was a grazing gazelle or a Smilodon with 7-inch fangs. But that pattern-seeking neural circuitry can also fool us. When I look at the sky I don’t immediately see bulls and crabs and hunters with studded belts. But given enough boredom, or perhaps eating the right mushrooms, one could certainly explain the constellations seen by Greek shepherds 2,500 years ago.

Another common fallacy is that correlation implies causality, which actually is an offshoot of seeking patterns where none really exist. An amusing example of correlation not being cause comes from an open letter to the Kansas School Board written by Bobby Henderson on behalf of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which was set up as a satirical protest against creationism:

“You may be interested to know that global warming, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of Pirates since the 1800s. For your interest, I have included a graph of the approximate number of pirates versus the average global temperature over the last 200 years. As you can see, there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between pirates and global temperature.”

Above all, one must remember that scientists are human and work in the midst of a class-divided society. Even a religious physicist can be objective when measuring the distance between the Earth and Moon, but as one approaches social questions and research, ingrained bias emanating from the dominant social mores can sometimes overwhelm the best of objective intentions.

Ideologues of Decaying Capitalism The Bankruptcy of Liberal Economists

By Joseph Seymour and Bruce André

(Part One)

“This expropriation [of capitalist property] will make it possible for the productive forces to develop to a tremendous extent. And when we see how incredibly capitalism is already retarding this development, when we see how much progress could be achieved on the basis of the level of technique already attained, we are entitled to say with the fullest confidence that the expropriation of the capitalists will inevitably result in an enormous development of the productive forces of human society.” [emphasis in original]

—V.I. Lenin, The State and Revolution (1917)

Lenin thus summarized Karl Marx’s fundamental critique of the capitalist system as well as the ultimate goal of socialism. Marxists gauge human progress by the development of mankind’s productive forces, from the stone tools of primitive society to present-day science, technology and the modern factory. With the advent and development of industrial capitalism beginning in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, one could envisage for the first time a future end to scarcity and class divisions. However, the private ownership of the means of production increasingly acted as a brake on the further development of the productive forces, not least through periodic economic crises. The emergence of modern imperialism at the end of the 19th century marked the onset of an epoch of global capitalist decay. The major capitalist powers, having divided the world through imperial conquest, embarked on a series of wars for its redivision, seeking to expand their colonial holdings and spheres of domination at the expense of their rivals.

The goal of proletarian revolution is to resolve the contradiction at the heart of capitalism, in which production for private profit stifles overall productive growth. Collectivizing the means of production and making the bounty of society available to all, a workers state will organize all of industry in the way that an individual assembly line is today conceived: according to a rational plan. An international socialist economy, by applying scientific planning to the entire economic system, will unleash a qualitative development of the productive forces and of labor productivity. This will liberate the productive capacities of mankind, ultimately eliminating economic scarcity and, with that, laying the material basis for the disappearance of classes and the withering away of the state.

In contrast to that Marxist view, the equation of capitalism with unlimited economic growth was an article of faith for bourgeois economists of the post-World War II generation. Today, that faith has largely faded. In the eyes of liberal economists, the meager rate of economic growth experienced in the U.S. in the past few decades has become the “new normal.” Lawrence Summers, a key economic operator in the Bill Clinton administration in the 1990s, sees the advanced capitalist countries as having entered a prolonged period of “secular stagnation,” reviving a notion that originated among liberal Keynesians like Alvin Hansen during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

That view was reflected in the 2016 presidential election as Hillary Clinton offered nothing except more of the same—“America is great”—with maybe some minor tinkering. Even her left-liberal (“progressive”) Democratic Party challenger Bernie Sanders did not claim that his policies would lead to a substantial boost in economic output but only that they would bring about a somewhat more equitable redistribution of income. Right-wing demagogue Donald Trump promoted the patent lie that he would double the current annual rate of economic growth from 2 percent to 4 percent, or even triple it.

Now, Trump and the Republican-dominated Congress, resurrecting Ronald Reagan’s supply-side economics, have pushed through a massive tax cut for corporations and the ultrarich. The idea that the benefits resulting from tax breaks for the wealthy will “trickle down” to the rest of the population in the form of increased investment, more jobs and higher wages is even more ludicrous today than it was in the 1980s, when it was the centerpiece of Reaganomics. American businesses are already sitting on an unprecedented stockpile of more than $2.4 trillion in cash. Apple and General Motors are hoarding almost 30 percent of their total value in cash. Why are companies not investing those staggering sums in new plants, machinery and additional workers? The obvious answer is that they lack confidence that such investment would generate an acceptable rate of return.

Meanwhile, the Democrats do not even pretend to offer a policy alternative that might significantly increase the rate of growth. Paul Krugman, probably the country’s best-known “progressive” economist because of his regular column in the New York Times, defended Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign on the grounds that government policy has little effect on economic growth, a supposedly mysterious process beyond the ken of his profession to understand, much less change:

“What do we know about accelerating long-run growth? According to the [Congressional] budget office, potential growth was pretty stable from 1970 to 2000, with nothing either Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton did making much obvious difference. The subsequent slide began under George W. Bush and continued under Mr. Obama. This history suggests no easy way to change the trend.”

—New York Times, 15 August 2016

The Falling Rate of Profit

A recent, book-length version of the “there’s not much we can do about economic growth” school of thought is Marc Levinson’s An Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy (2016). A former economics and finance editor of the Economist, house organ of Anglo-American bankers, Levinson strikes a contrarian pose, gleefully debunking the economic policy doctrines of both wings of the bourgeois political spectrum: Keynesianism on the left and monetarism and supply-side economics on the right. He contends that the relatively high rates of growth experienced by the advanced capitalist countries in the three decades after World War II amounted to a fortuitous historical accident that cannot be replicated by any kind of government policy.

A much weightier expression (in every respect) of historical pessimism with regard to the American economy is a recent book by a prominent liberal academic economist, Robert J. Gordon, The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War (2016). Unlike An Extraordinary Time, which has a slapdash, journalistic quality, Gordon’s book (a 700-plus-page tome) is a work of serious scholarship. While Gordon’s argumentation differs somewhat from that of Levinson, as does the historical scope of his study, his conclusion is basically the same:

“This is a book about the drama of a revolutionary century when, through a set of miracles, economic growth accelerated, the modern world was created, and then after that creation the potential for future inventions having a similar impact on everyday life of necessity was inevitably diminished. The implications for the future of U.S. and world economic growth could not be more profound....

“The economic revolution of 1870 to 1970 was unique in human history, unrepeatable because so many of its achievements could happen only once.”

Gordon’s use of the term “miracles” underscores his belief that mere mortals cannot consciously control the quantity and content of the material wealth created by their labor.

In the introductory section of An Extraordinary Time, Levinson defends Obama against a charge leveled by right-wing scribe George F. Will, who stated: “Making slow growth normal serves the progressive program of defining economic failure down.” To this Levinson replies, “as if the rate of economic growth were a matter of presidential discretion.” It is, of course, true that in capitalist America the policies of a given administration usually have a marginal effect on economic growth.

The expansion (or contraction) of the production of marketable goods and services under capitalism is mainly determined by the extent to which the executives of large corporations and Wall Street financiers invest profits in new productive facilities, especially those embodying more advanced (labor-saving) technologies. What drives capitalist investment is not the impulse to maximize output or labor productivity but rather to maximize the rate of profit (i.e., the ratio of profit to the market value of the means of production).

However, Marx, in one of his key insights, demonstrated that there is an inherent tendency for the rate of profit, the driving force of the capitalist system, to decline over time. By prompting capitalists to cut back their investments, a falling rate of profit generates periodic crises, usually triggered in financial markets. The result is a contraction of output and increased unemployment.

Marx’s explanation for the falling tendency of the rate of profit flowed from his understanding that surplus value—the unpaid portion of workers’ labor—is the source of profit, not the capitalists’ expenditures on the means of production (e.g., machinery and raw materials). Marx observed that especially in periods of economic boom, when workers can feel emboldened to demand higher wages, individual capitalists invest an increased amount of capital in plant upgrades and such in order to cut labor costs. By doing so, the capitalist gains a competitive advantage. However, as all capitalists follow suit, the total amount of surplus value generated per amount of capital invested—i.e., the average profit rate—declines.

Capitalists invest in expanding productive capacity on the assumption that they will be able to sell the goods produced at a particular rate of profit. However, as the profit rate drops, they find themselves unable to sell their products at the expected profit rate. They cut back investments and slash production, resulting in an economic downturn. Workers are thrown out onto the street; entire factories become rusted relics.

Bourgeois economic ideologues, from Keynesians to monetarists and supply-siders, identify the laws governing the capitalist mode of production with the laws governing production as such. In the absence of a revolutionary working-class alternative, the appeal of Trump’s right-wing populist demagogy is enhanced by the fact that both liberals, like Krugman and Gordon, as well as centrists on the bourgeois political spectrum, like Summers and Levinson, insist that it is not possible to overcome the decades-long stagnation in the living standards of American working people.

From Kennedy’s “New Economics” to Obama’s “New Normal”

In the past, Democratic politicians, especially those on the more liberal wing of the party, promised to deliver a new era of economic prosperity. John F. Kennedy’s successful 1960 presidential campaign against Richard Nixon, who had been vice president in the Republican Eisenhower administration (1953-61), was dominated by Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union and fears among the ruling class that the U.S. was falling behind in science and technology. In its economic message, Kennedy’s campaign resembled Trump’s. His platform called for boosting economic growth and dynamism under the slogan “Let’s get this country moving again.” He pointed to the sluggish economic performance, punctuated by two recessions, during Eisenhower’s second term. In this respect, the campaign tactics used by Kennedy against Nixon and Eisenhower were similar to those used by Trump against Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

In An Extraordinary Time, Levinson retrospectively criticizes liberal Keynesians like Walter Heller, chief economic adviser to both the Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations. Heller claimed that fiscal policy (taxation and government expenditure) could be fine-tuned so as to maintain full employment and maximize economic growth. By the late 1970s, Democratic politicians and their intellectual apologists were singing a different, more downbeat, tune.

Capitalizing on the downfall of Nixon resulting from the Watergate scandal, in 1977 Jimmy Carter, a centrist Southern Democrat (like Bill Clinton), entered the White House. A few years later, the hapless Carter administration confronted an unusual condition termed “stagflation”: rapidly rising prices combined with a recession. Levinson describes the widespread economic insecurity that propelled the right-wing Republican Reagan to the presidency in 1981: “The conservative ascendance came only as mortgage interest rates above 11 percent made young people despair of ever buying a home and as layoff notices went out to ironworkers on construction sites and toolmakers in auto plants.”

Surveying those dismal times, a mainstream liberal academic economist, Lester C. Thurow, published a book in 1980 on the state of the U.S. economy titled The Zero-Sum Society: Distribution and the Possibilities for Economic Change. As indicated by the title, Thurow argued that it was no longer possible to substantially increase the size of the economic pie so that everyone would get a somewhat bigger piece. Economic policy now involved recutting the existing pie such that some people would get a larger slice and others a smaller one:

“For most of our problems there are several solutions. But all these solutions have the characteristic that someone must suffer large economic losses. No one wants to volunteer for this role, and we have a political process that is incapable of forcing anyone to shoulder this burden. Everyone wants someone else to suffer the necessary economic losses, and as a consequence none of the possible solutions can be adopted.”

In fact, the almost four decades since Thurow wrote those lines have seen an unremitting war by the bourgeoisie to force workers, minorities and the poor to “suffer the necessary economic losses” to bolster capitalist profits. That one-sided war on workers has been facilitated by the trade-union bureaucracy, which maneuvers for crumbs while peddling a mythical “partnership” of labor with the bosses and their parties, particularly Democrats who falsely pose as “friends of labor.”

Technological Innovation and Capitalist Investment

The main theme of Levinson’s An Extraordinary Time is that economic growth, based on increasing labor productivity through technological innovation, is impervious to government policy. After listing several explanations offered by academic economists for the slower growth of labor productivity in the advanced capitalist countries since the 1970s, Levinson concludes:

“None of these explanations sufficed to explain the productivity bust afflicting countries with vastly different economies and divergent approaches to economic policy. The more deeply the scholars mined the data, the more confused they became. What the data could not yet show was that the world had moved to a new stage of economic growth, one that would develop in a far different way....

“Future advances in well-being would depend heavily on developing innovations and putting them to effective use.”

The last statement is manifestly true. Increases in labor productivity under capitalism are determined by two main factors: the extent to which capitalists invest their profits in new productive facilities (plant and equipment) embodying more advanced technology and the degree to which the new technology increases output per unit of labor input.

Levinson does recognize a causal link between the slowdown in the growth of labor productivity and a decline in the rate of capital investment:

“Across the wealthy economies, business investment, which had increased an average of 5.6 percent per year between 1960 and 1973, grew at a far slower rate, barely 4 percent per year, for the next two decades. Sluggish investment left steel mills operating antiquated blast furnaces and insurance offices using high-speed computer printers to spit out form upon form for clerks to organize in file cabinets. Technological innovations usually arrive in the business world incorporated in new equipment and facilities. With firms deferring such investments at every turn, their workers’ productivity improved at less than half the rate in the decades after 1973 as in the decades before.”

However, Levinson makes no effort to explain why the rate of investment has declined to such an extent. In particular, he does not consider the interrelationship between capital investment, technological innovation and the rate of profit.

As Marx underlined, capitalists will invest in new facilities incorporating more advanced technology if, and only if, they believe the increase in profit per worker will be greater than the increased market value of capital per worker. If capitalists discover that their investments are not generating a competitive rate of profit, they will halt or cut back their investments, often triggering an economic downturn.

Marx thus proved that capitalist production increasingly puts the brakes on historical development, at the same time that it creates capitalism’s own gravedigger, the proletariat. He and Friedrich Engels explained that the only way to end the boom-bust cycles inherent to capitalism is for the working class to take control of the means of production through socialist revolution and institute a planned, collectivized economy.

When was the last time the media threw 100% of its support behind one party’s presidential candidate? - by Mike Whitney,Liberal,3,58eaz6,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/58eaz6/when_was_the_last_time_the_media_threw_100_of_its/,0,"The ruling class unanimously backs Hillary Clinton, that much is obvious.

“For any minimally conscious American citizen, it is absolutely evident that Donald Trump is not only facing the mammoth Clinton political machine, but, also the combined forces of the viciously dishonest Mainstream Media.” -Boyd D. Cathey, “The Tape, the Conspiracy, and the Death of the Old Politics”, Unz Review

“The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary.” -Donald Trump, Twitter

When was the last time the media threw 100% of its support behind one party’s presidential candidate? What does that say about the media?

Do you feel comfortable with the idea that a handful of TV and print-news executives are inserting themselves into the process and choosing our leaders for us? Is that the way democracy is supposed to work?

Check out this blurb from The Hill:

“The broadcast evening news programs ABC, NBC and CBS covered allegations against Trump by several women who claim he sexually assaulted them for more than 23 minutes on Thursday night. But revelations in the WikiLeaks dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta which included…sympathy for Wall Street, advocation for open borders and blatant examples of media collusion ….got a whole 1 minute and 7 seconds combined.” Ratio of negative coverage of Trump to Clinton: 23:1

In print on Thursday, it was no better. The New York Times had 11 negative stories on Trump…But zero on Clinton/WikiLeaks. Ratio: 11:0.” (Media and Trump bias; Not even trying to hide it anymore, The Hill)

The article in The Hill also refers to a survey by the Washington Post and ABC News that asks participants six questions about allegations of sexual misconduct by Trump, but zero questions about Podesta’s incriminating emails.

Is that what you call “balance”?

I should state out-front, that I don’t plan to vote for either candidate, Trump or Clinton, so my claims of “bias” are not grounded in support for one candidate or the other. I am simply ticked-off by the fact that the media honchos have pulled out all the stops and are inserting themselves in the process to produce the outcome they want.

That’s what you call “rigging” an election. When you turn on Washington Week (Gwen Ifil) on public TV and see an assembled panel of six pundits–three conservatives and three liberals–and all six turn out to love Hillary and hate Trump; you can be reasonably certain that the election is rigged, because that’s what rigging is. Rather than providing background information about the candidate’s position on the issues so voters can make an informed decision, the media uses opinionmakers to heap praise on one candidate while savagely denigrating the other. The obvious goal is to shape public opinion in the way that best suits the interests of the people who own the media and who belong to the establishment of rich and powerful elites who run the country, the 1 percent. In this case, the ruling class unanimously backs Hillary Clinton, that much is obvious.

Fortunately, the tide is turning on the mainstream media as people look to other, more reliable sources for their information. It should come as no surprise that people are more distrustful of media than ever before and that that a great many feel that the media is conducting a brutal class war against ordinary working people. Surely, anyone who has followed economic developments at all in the last seven years, knows that the policies of the Fed have created a yawning chasm between rich and poor that is only getting worse as long as the levers of power stay in the hands of establishment politicians. Hillary Clinton is certainly the worst of these establishment politicos. Aside from being the most widely-reviled candidate the Democrats have ever nominated, she is the embodiment of political corruption and cronyism. How is it, you may ask, that someone like Clinton was able to nab “upwards of $225,000 per speech” from Goldman Sachs if she wasn’t influence peddling?

Does it really matter what she said in these speeches?

Not to me. The huge sums of money prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Clinton is selling access, tacitly agreeing to “go easy” on the big Wall Street investment banks provided they keep her foundation’s coffers overflowing. What other possible explanation could there be?

Do as many Americans know about Hillary’s sordid dealings with Wall Street as know about Trump’s “alleged” sexual dalliances?

Of course not. It’s not even close.

Do they know that Clinton was the driving force behind the intervention in Libya and Syria, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have died and seven million have been internally displaced? Do they know she was involved in the toppling of a democratically-elected government in Honduras or that a number of prominent neocons, who dragged the US into war in Iraq based on WMD lies, now support her?

Nope.

Do people know that Hillary had proof that ISIS –America’s arch enemy– was being funded and supported by our allies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar and, yet, she never reported the news to the American people??

Here’s a damning clip from one of the Podesta emails:

“We need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isis and other radical groups in the region.”

Remember when George W. Bush said that ‘We will treat the terrorists and the people who support the terrorists the same”?

Hillary must not have gotten that memo or we would have bombed Riyadh by now.

Do people know that there has never been a war that Hillary didn’t support, a job-killing “free trade” bill she didn’t back, or a civil liberties-eviscerating piece of legislation (Clinton voted for the original USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, as well as the revised version in 2006.) she wasn’t eager to sign?

Oh, but she does support “women’s reproductive rights” which makes her a big champion of personal freedom among her narrow demographic of successful, educated, white women. Excuse me, for not doing handstands.

Here’s another short clip from the WSWS:

“Hillary and Bill Clinton have accumulated a total of $153 million in speaking fees since Bill Clinton left the White House. Only the very naïve could believe that these vast sums were paid for the speeches themselves. They were payment for services rendered to the American financial aristocracy over a protracted period.” (In secret Goldman Sachs speeches, Clinton explains why the rich should rule, World socialist Web Site)

Get the picture? Hillary Clinton isn’t a candidate, she’s a franchise, a walking ATM machine. And her shady Foundation is nothing more than a vast recycling bin for illicit funds that pour into the political sausage-making machine in the form of contributions and magically transform themselves into special favors for the billionaire class.

Is the system rigged?

You’re damn right it is! Check this out from Zero Hedge under the heading of “73% Of Republicans Say Election Could Be “Stolen” As Trump Slams “Rigged Elections”:

“A Politico/Morning Consult Poll found that 41% of registered voters say that the election cold be stolen from Trump while 73% of Republicans fear the same.

The American electorate has turned deeply skeptical about the integrity of the nation’s election apparatus, with 41 percent of voters saying November’s election could be “stolen” from Donald Trump due to widespread voter fraud.

The new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll — conducted among 1,999 registered voters Oct. 13 through Oct. 15 — shows that Trump’s repeated warnings about a “rigged” election are having effect: 73 percent of Republicans think the election could be swiped from him. Just 17 percent of Democrats agree with the prospect of massive fraud at the ballot box.” (Zero Hedge)

Should we be worried about the election being rigged? Should we be concerned that a significant number of Americans no longer trust the “integrity of the electoral process”?

And how are these allegations (that the election was stolen) going to impact Hillary’s ability to govern?

It’s going to impact it dramatically, in fact, it could stop her dead in her tracks. It could even precipitate a Constitutional crisis. And that’s where all this is headed, isn’t it?

Consider this: Maybe Trump isn’t really trying to win any more. Maybe he knows he can’t overcome a 12 point deficit this late in the game, so he’s going to pull a Samson. He’s going to shake the pillars and bring the whole rotten temple crashing down around him. He’s going use all his influence to discredit this fake democratic system the elites have painstakingly put together to control the public, he’s going to grow his throng of angry supporters into a small army, and he’s going to spearhead a (mainly) right wing populist movement that is going impose gridlock on Washington, deepen the political divisions, acrimony and polarization across the country, and make Clinton’s tenure as president a living hell.

That’s the gameplan. He’s going to marshal enough grassroots support that Clinton will spend her entire four years bogged down in endless investigations, fending off charges of criminal misconduct, and leap-frogging from one seedy scandal to the next.

No, Trump isn’t planning on winning. He doesn’t want to be president. He wants to be a modern-day Braveheart leading the peasants into battle against a thoroughly-corrupt and heinous ruling class establishment. That’s what he wants, and that’s why political has-beens like Gingrich and Giuliani have attached themselves to him like the plague. They see an opening for resurrecting their own dismal careers.

In any event, Hillary’s going to win the election, that’s for sure. But don’t count Trump out just yet. He’s just getting warmed up.

Imperialist Hysteria After Nuclear Test - Defend North Korea! (/r/WorkersVanguard),Liberal,2,551a70,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/551a70/imperialist_hysteria_after_nuclear_test_defend/,0,"https://archive.is/8xPFv

Imperialist Hysteria After Nuclear Test

Defend North Korea!

On September 9, 2016, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test with an explosive yield of approximately 15 to 20 kilotons. Nuclear testing was initiated by North Korea in 2006. However, this was the second such test this year with a yield about twice the magnitude of any of the previous four documented detonations. During the past year North Korea has conducted several missile tests that have demonstrated its capacity to fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile as well as a solid-fuel, two-stage medium-range missile, covering northeast Asia, including Japan. Nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker pointed to the importance of these events: “At a minimum, the current state of the North’s nuclear arsenal is an effective deterrent to potential hostile external intervention” (38north.org, 12 September).

This achievement deserves the acclaim of the world’s working and oppressed masses. It enhances the defense of the social revolution that survived U.S. imperialism’s efforts to drown it in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War. General Douglas MacArthur and others in U.S. ruling circles were intent on using the peninsula as a launching pad from which to overturn the 1949 Chinese Revolution. Simultaneously, North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and effective delivery systems serves to impede the U.S.’s current campaign—coyly dubbed the “Pivot to Asia”—to encircle and eventually throttle the People’s Republic of China, by far the most powerful of the deformed workers states that have survived in the aftermath of the 1991-92 counterrevolution in the Soviet Union. It is vital for the international proletariat to stand for the unconditional military defense of the North Korean and Chinese deformed workers states.

The U.S. has repeatedly denounced North Korea’s nuclear tests. Provocatively, in the aftermath of the September 9 detonation, two U.S. bombers, accompanied by Japanese and South Korean fighter jets, flew at low altitude only 48 miles from the North Korean border. Admiral Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, described this operation as a response to “North Korea’s provocative and destabilizing actions.” Adopting the role of stooge for the U.S. imperialists, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon—a one-time South Korean deputy ambassador to the U.S.—fulminated over the North’s “provocative actions.” He demanded additional UN sanctions against the Kim Jong Un regime, on top of the harsh measures adopted in March after the first of this year’s nuclear tests. Meanwhile, a South Korean military source threatened to reduce North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, to ashes should the North show any signs of using its nuclear arms. The backbone for this bellicosity is provided by the more than 28,000 American troops currently stationed in South Korea.

It is the U.S. that, from the time of the Korean War, has been responsible for an unending series of provocations and savageries. During that war, carried out under the auspices of the UN, the U.S. utilized oceans of napalm to incinerate the population, with a resultant slaughter of over three million Koreans. It was due to the heroic struggle of Korea’s workers and peasants and the intervention of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army that the imperialists did not succeed in overturning the social revolution in the North. The war ended in an armistice, sealing Korea’s division along class lines at the 38th parallel. Subsequently, Washington went on to prop up a number of dictatorial regimes in the South that ruled through sheer terror, while the U.S. forces permanently stationed there were often used to quell popular unrest and to suppress labor actions.

Since the fall of the USSR, China’s reward for its longstanding cooperation with the U.S. to isolate and weaken the Soviet Union has been to increasingly find itself placed in the crosshairs of the American imperialists. The U.S. has usually avoided using the direct threat of military action against China, often invoking the specter of attacks launched by North Korea to justify its military operations in the region. Thus, it was North Korea, not China, that was dubbed part of the “axis of evil.” In spite of China’s ardent wooing of the reactionary Park Geun-hye regime in the South, her government has agreed to the installation of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile shield by the U.S. as a defense against the North. This has exercised China, which rightly perceives the system to be a threat to its missiles. In 2009 Thaad was installed in Hawaii supposedly to prevent a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile attack. At that time the North had no such capacity, but China did. Our demand for all U.S. forces and bases out of South Korea is both a defense of North Korea and the Chinese Revolution.

Both the Republican and Democratic candidates for the presidency are running primarily on their purported virtues as the leader most qualified to smash America’s enemies abroad. Although ISIS is the main target of their fulminations, the ultimate target for U.S. imperialism is the Chinese deformed workers state. In the past four years, the number of soldiers and civilian army workers in Asia has increased from 70,000 to more than 100,000. In response to China’s just and legitimate claim to the Spratly Islands, the U.S. has been conducting aggressive naval operations in the South China Sea, which the Japanese navy will soon join. The U.S. is also seeking to bolster joint military training exercises with Australia to address “challenges” in the region.

When North Korea conducted a nuclear test in January, the Chinese Stalinist regime criminally assisted the U.S., even helping to draft the sanctions that the UN imposed in March. Since then, the U.S. has been frustrated by Chinese unwillingness to implement the sanctions, as it now seeks more sanctions, as yet unspecified. Absent China’s implementation, the sanctions have had little impact, as 90 percent of North Korea’s trade is with China. Today, China views North Korea’s nuclear tests as a buffer against the hostile intents of the U.S. But as demonstrated by its support for the March sanctions, this appreciation could change in a second. At this time, China is unwilling to entertain the collapse of the North Korean regime, which would plunge the peninsula into chaos. It has also been planning to deepen military cooperation with Russia (the other major obstacle to U.S. imperialism’s overwhelming military dominance), including a joint naval drill to be hosted by China later this year.

It is unfortunately true that North Korea’s success in developing its nuclear capability is in no way sufficient to the task of defending the social revolution that was solidified in the context of the Korean War. North Korea and China as well as Cuba, Vietnam and Laos are deformed workers states: societies based on the expropriation of their respective capitalist class rulers and where that rule was replaced by working-class property forms—i.e., the nationalization of production and a state monopoly on all foreign trade. At the same time, these countries are governed by parasitic bureaucratic castes whose rule is based on the political expropriation of the working class.

Our defense of the deformed workers states does not entail political support for the ruling bureaucracies, which in North Korea is deeply nationalist, weirdly nepotistic and brutally repressive. Committed to “socialism” only in its half of the Korean Peninsula, the Kim regime disdains the struggle for socialist revolution in the South and calls for “peaceful reunification” of Korea, a setup for capitalist reunification.

We fight for workers political revolution in the deformed workers states in order to sweep away bureaucratic misrule and open the road to the further expansion of proletarian revolution. The parasitic bureaucracies understand that their privileges would not survive proletarian political revolutions, and thus to secure their well-being, they offer their services to the imperialists as they pursue the chimera of “peaceful coexistence” with the world capitalist order. The imperialists, for their part, are willing to deal in the short run while never abandoning their hostility to the survival of proletarian power anywhere on the planet.

For its part, the various manifestations of the Kim dynasty in North Korea have episodically displayed a willingness to abandon their efforts to obtain deterrent capacity in exchange for economic assistance from the American imperialists. Although North Korea has recovered somewhat from the economic disaster that befell it in the aftermath of the destruction of the Soviet Union, its economy remains precarious and will certainly suffer from the extensive damage it sustained late last month as a result of Typhoon Lionrock. It now plans to launch international appeals for donations, causing many bourgeois pundits to indicate that such assistance will not be forthcoming given their bad behavior, i.e., daring to conduct a nuclear test.

We fight for the revolutionary reunification of Korea: proletarian socialist revolution in the South in conjunction with working-class political revolution in the North. A struggle for the revolutionary reunification of Korea would ignite other struggles for proletarian power throughout the region. Today the South Korean economy is in the tank, with unprecedented levels of youth unemployment, and there is evident popular resentment against the planned introduction by the U.S. of the Thaad missile shield. The objective conditions to ignite the struggle for a revolutionary reunification have long existed.

Defense of North Korea, China and the other remaining deformed workers states is integral to the fight for socialist revolution in the advanced capitalist countries, including Japan, the imperialist powerhouse of Asia, and the U.S., the planet’s most dominant power. The International Communist League is dedicated to forging the proletarian vanguard parties that, as sections of a reforged Fourth International, can lead the working class in sweeping away the capitalist-imperialist order and building a world socialist society of material abundance.

War Criminals Rally Behind Hawk Clinton (/r/WorkersVanguard),Liberal,2,50f6z7,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/50f6z7/war_criminals_rally_behind_hawk_clinton/,1,"https://archive.is/DWTWJ

Capitalist Green Party No Alternative

We Need a Revolutionary Workers Party!

Coming off the Democratic National Convention—where retired four-star Marine general John Allen roused the party faithful into jingoistic chants of “USA! USA!”—Hillary Clinton has been racking up endorsements from a veritable rogues’ gallery of U.S. imperialism’s leading warmongers, mass murderers and Dr. Strangeloves. In early August, 50 former top national security advisors to Republican administrations going back to Richard Nixon signed a letter declaring that their party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, “would be the most reckless President in American history.” What moved them to jump ship was not Trump’s flagrant racism, a card the GOP has been playing for decades, albeit somewhat more sotto voce.

Rather, these Republicans lost it when Trump opined that he would not necessarily support the Baltic NATO states if Russia attacked. For more than a decade, the U.S. imperialists have been provoking capitalist Russia, including through a military buildup of NATO forces on its borders. Now the Democrats and many Republicans are seizing on Trump’s stated affinity for Vladimir Putin to portray him as a Manchurian candidate, a puppet for the Russian president. In a 5 August New York Times op-ed piece titled “I Ran the C.I.A. Now I’m Endorsing Hillary Clinton,” Michael Morell, former acting director of the CIA, put it baldly: “In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”

In contrast, Morell promotes Clinton’s qualifications to be Commander-in-Chief of U.S. imperialism. He points to her role as an “early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice” (i.e., murdered him and threw his body into the sea) and a consistent promoter of a “more aggressive approach” in Syria (i.e., bomb ’em back to the Stone Age). He salutes her willingness to “use force” and “her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all—whether to put young American women and men in harm’s way.” No wonder that she has for months been getting the support of several leading neocons who worry that Trump is an “unreliable” loose cannon. In short, Clinton is a proven, gold-plated war hawk.

Donald Trump is a dangerous demagogue, capable of saying and doing just about anything. And there is plenty for working people and the oppressed to fear as he incites a frenzy of “America First” chauvinist reaction among his supporters, who include the race-terrorists of the KKK and other fascists. It is this fear that the Democrats have cynically played on to get black people, immigrants, workers and the now-dejected youthful followers of Bernie Sanders to rally behind Clinton.

In the Democratic primaries, 77 percent of the black vote went to Clinton. Overwhelmingly, black people see the former party of the Confederacy and the Jim Crow South as the only option to defeat Trump. It was heartbreaking to see the mothers of Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and others killed at the hands of the cops or racist vigilantes on stage at the Democratic Convention for the coronation of a woman who reviled young black men as “superpredators” and backed her husband’s racist anti-crime bill and the destruction of welfare.

As always the labor misleaders offered their services, with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka also taking the stage to push the whopping lie that Clinton will “protect workplace rights” and “stand up to Wall Street.” The union tops’ allegiance to the Democrats is an old shell game. Their subordination of the interests of the working class to the party of their exploiters has left a trail of broken strikes, busted unions and the ongoing destruction of the livelihood of working people.

Meanwhile, as she tries to court Republicans, Clinton’s attentions are directed not to the traditional base of the Democrats but to wooing Wall Street and the generals, spies and other operatives of U.S. imperialism into her “big tent.” And she has been very successful. As Black Agenda Report editor Glen Ford wrote in “Hillary Stuffs Entire U.S. Ruling Class into Her Big, Nasty Tent” (10 August):

“It’s a funky place to be—especially for the traditional Black, brown and labor ‘base’ of the party, now squished into a remote and malodorous corner of the tent, near the latrine, clutching the pages of a party platform that was never meant to bind anyone....

“She is the candidate of the imperial war machine, whose operatives have flocked to her corner in dread of Trump’s willingness to make ‘deals’ with the Russians and Chinese. She is the candidate of multinational corporations, which are perfectly confident she is lying about her stance on TPP and other trade deals. And she is the candidate of the CIA and its fellow global outlaws, who will thrive as never before with a president in the White House who cackles ‘We came, we saw, he died’ when the leader of an African country is murdered by Islamic jihadists supported by the United States.”

If elected, Clinton will have her trigger-happy fingers on the nuclear button. For his part, Ford, like other radical liberals, not to mention a cast of self-proclaimed socialists, looks for refuge in the capitalist Green Party.

From Bernie Sanders to the Greens

Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin succinctly explained that the fraud of bourgeois democracy amounts to deciding “once every few years which member of the ruling class is to repress and crush the people.” In this contest between perhaps the two most despised candidates in U.S. history, we aim to drive home the Marxist understanding of the class nature of the capitalist order, and the need to build a multiracial revolutionary workers party independent of and in opposition to the rule of the capitalist class enemy and all its parties.

In contrast, organizations like Socialist Alternative (SAlt) and the International Socialist Organization (ISO), notwithstanding their rare genuflections to Marxism, are busy trying to pump some air into the deflated tire of bourgeois electoralism by channeling discontent into support for the Green Party’s presidential candidate, Jill Stein. Having spent the last year rallying behind Bernie Sanders and his calls for a “political revolution against the billionaire class,” SAlt wailed that Sanders “walked out on that strategy, and called for a vote for the very establishment we have been fighting against.” In fact, he did exactly what he promised when he launched his campaign: to back the winner of the Democratic primaries. As we wrote in “Break with the Capitalist Democrats and Republicans!” (WV No. 1092, 1 July):

“Many of those who support Sanders believe that his primary bid has launched a ‘movement’ that represents some kind of challenge to the political establishment. In fact, Sanders has done everything to reinforce this establishment by refurbishing its image and reinforcing illusions and confidence in American capitalist democracy. He brought large numbers of disaffected young people ‘into the political process’ (read: Democratic Party)....

“To put it plainly: the pseudo-socialist groups that support Sanders have done their best, within the limits of their forces, to reinforce the ties that bind the working class politically to its class enemies. As revolutionary Marxists, we offer no political support on principle to any party of the bosses—not only the major parties of the U.S. ruling class, the Republicans and Democrats, but also small-time capitalist parties such as the Greens.”

Having led many youth and others down the garden path with Sanders, SAlt is now trying to corral them behind Stein’s campaign as “the clear continuation of our political revolution.” Kshama Sawant, SAlt’s Seattle city council member, argues that Stein “has gone further than Bernie, in particular with her rejection of key aspects of U.S. foreign policy.” That wouldn’t be hard. Sanders argues that the U.S. “should have the strongest military in the world” and has an impeccable record of support to the wars, occupations, drone strikes and other depredations of U.S. imperialism (see “Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog,” WV No. 1083, 12 February).

And what is the position of Stein’s Green Party? Her election platform calls for cutting in half the U.S. military budget, which is many times more than the combined total of all its imperialist rivals. So Stein is for fewer bombs than Bernie and Hillary but is nonetheless dedicated to preserving an arsenal to enforce the predatory and murderous interests of America’s rulers abroad.

Stein’s program calls to “restore the National Guard as the centerpiece of our defense.” You know, the National Guard that occupied Ferguson to put down protests against the cop killing of Michael Brown in 2014; the National Guard that union-busting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker had on standby to do the same against black protests in Milwaukee; the National Guard that shot dead four antiwar protesters at Kent State in 1970 after being called in from a nearby deployment against a Teamsters strike; the National Guard that, as the domestic troops enforcing the diktats of America’s capitalist rulers, has the blood of countless striking workers on its hands.

For its part, the ISO has also, and yet again, thrown its support to the Green Party. In particular, the ISO is enthused over “the passage of an amendment to the party platform making the Greens an explicitly anti-capitalist party.” Why would that make any difference to the ISO? They supported the Green Party and even ran their own members as candidates of the party when the Greens openly described themselves as a party of “small business, responsible stakeholder capitalism.” Despite the Green Party’s current proclaimed rejection of the “capitalist system,” the amendment to its program doesn’t change its character as a bourgeois party and is, in fact, “balanced” by also rejecting “state socialism,” raising the all-purpose anti-communist bogeyman of totalitarianism.

The Greens’ vision is of “an economy based on large-scale green public works, municipalization, and workplace and community democracy.” Such a Shangri-La is a pipe dream conjured up by relatively well-heeled and overwhelmingly white middle-class people who live in advanced capitalist countries and have their homes in neighborhoods far removed from the industry required for a modern economy. They are the types that have access to resources for “local sustainability,” with vegetable plots, bike paths and a city council that will raise taxes on such unhealthy habits as smoking and sugary sodas, depriving the poor and working class of some of the few pleasures they have in life.

Stein also says she stands for beneficial things like free Medicare for all, a living wage, jobs for the unemployed, free education through university, etc. But these promises—which in themselves would only provide limited relief from the all-sided destitution faced by working people and the poor—are hot air. Such concessions will only be wrung from the bourgeoisie through class struggle, mobilizing the social power of the working class whose labor produces the wealth that is stolen by the capitalist exploiters.

For working people to get their hands on that wealth, the capitalists’ power has to be broken. That means a workers party that fights for a workers government to expropriate the capitalist owners and expand the productive forces in order to create an egalitarian socialist society, one devoted to providing for the needs of the many, not the profits of the few. This is counterposed to the program of the Green Party, which is devoted not to increasing but to decreasing production and consumption—purportedly to “save the earth,” not its human inhabitants.

The Third Party Fraud

There have been several third-party candidacies in the history of the U.S. From Robert La Follette’s 1924 presidential bid to Henry Wallace’s 1948 Progressive Party, their purpose has been to corral discontent with the two major parties into another capitalist electoral vehicle with promises of a better deal for the “little guy.” In its call to “Fix Our Broken System,” the Green Party promotes the value of third parties to not only “lure voters to the polls” but “also help to turn one of the major parties out of office.” As an example, they point to Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, whose 1912 election campaign “helped the Democrats wrest the White House from 20 years of unchallenged Republican supremacy.” The winner was Southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson, an arch-segregationist who drove blacks out of federal civil service jobs and was an admirer of the Ku Klux Klan.

Similarly, the Green Party’s statement argues that third parties keep “Americans involved in our democratic process” by providing “an ‘emotional bridge’ for voters who are weary of supporting one major party but are not yet ready to vote for the other.” Here they grotesquely hold up the 1968 presidential campaign of George Wallace. “Segregation forever” Wallace was the former Dixiecrat governor of Alabama who revolted against civil rights legislation. According to the Greens, his American Independent Party campaign “drew support from traditional Southern Democrats who weren’t emotionally prepared to vote as Republicans.” The Southern Democrats crossed that “emotional bridge” and are now a major component of the racist yahoos rallying for Trump.

And it’s not just them. Last summer, former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader heralded Trump as a “breath of fresh air.” Welcoming Trump’s then-refusal to rule out a third party challenge if he lost the GOP nomination, Nader argued: “The two party tyranny that blocks voter choices and dominates the political scene on behalf of big business needs to be broken up and Trump is the one to do it.” Wow—the ticket to breaking the domination of big business is a billionaire real estate mogul!

To all those who bought Sanders’ phony “political revolution,” don’t get fooled again by Stein’s Green Party. The facade of bourgeois democracy is designed to obscure the fact that the capitalist state is an instrument of organized force and violence, consisting at its core of the police, army, courts and prisons. Its purpose is to maintain capitalist rule and profit through the suppression of the working class, the forcible segregation of the majority of black people at the bottom of society and by advancing the interests of U.S. imperialism abroad.

It is a myth that working people and the oppressed can elect a reformed capitalist government that will defend their interests against the robber barons of Wall Street. As communists, we champion the fight for jobs for all at good wages; for decent housing; for quality, fully government-funded health care and education. Our purpose is to link such demands to building a revolutionary working-class party that will inscribe on its banner the defense of immigrant rights and the fight for black freedom as part of the struggle to overthrow this decaying capitalist system. As the Spartacist League/U.S. Declaration of Principles, written at our founding 50 years ago, states:

“The victory of the proletariat on a world scale would place unimagined material abundance at the service of human needs, lay the basis for the elimination of social classes, and eliminate forever the drive for war inherent in the world economic system of capitalism. For the first time mankind will grasp the reins of history and control its own creation, society, resulting in an undreamed-of emancipation of human potential, the limitless expansion of freedom in every area, and a monumental forward surge of civilization. Only then will it be possible to realize the free development of each individual as the condition for the free development of all.”

"Postal Labor Union, Activists push for the U.S. Postal Service to offer basic banking",Liberal,3,4w0nun,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4w0nun/postal_labor_union_activists_push_for_the_us/,0,"Until the late 1960s, you could walk into a post office and deposit money in a savings account at the same time that you bought stamps or mailed packages.

An outgrowth of the financial panic of 1907, the no-frills postal bank surged in popularity during the Great Depression. But as commercial banks expanded and offered higher interest rates, the United States Postal Savings System became as outdated as a black-and-white movie.

Now, in the wake of another financial crisis, there's a new push for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver basic banking services again.

The effort is led by consumer advocates, financial reform groups, postal labor unions and some leading liberals, such as Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). They say that offering services such as paycheck cashing, bill payment and free ATMs would provide cash-strapped consumers with an affordable alternative to payday, auto-title and other short-term loans that have been criticized for high fees.

""We have millions and millions of low-income people who have to go to these payday lenders and pay outrageous interest rates. They're getting ripped off right and left,"" Sanders said on ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" in October.

""We can have our Postal Service provide modest banking to low-income people where they can cash their checks and they can do banking,"" Sanders said. ""I think it will help the post office and it will help millions of low-income people.""

The Postal Service's inspector general's office agrees. It estimates that expanding financial services beyond the current limited offerings, which include money orders and international funds transfers, could pump $8.9 billion a year into the financially struggling agency.

""The Postal Service has a public mission to serve citizens and support the growth of commerce,"" the inspector general's office said in a report last spring that presented five potential approaches for expanded banking services. ""And while it is required to cover its costs, profit is not its key motive.""

The American Postal Workers Union has formed a coalition, the Campaign for Postal Banking, that in December delivered a petition with more than 150,000 signatures to Deputy Postmaster General Ronald A. Stroman urging the agency to expand its financial offerings.

""Big banks are turning their backs on families,"" union President Mark Dimondstein said. ""Without bank accounts, they fall prey to predatory lenders.""

Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan hasn't ruled out the idea of expanded banking services after her predecessor dismissed the suggestion in January as he headed into retirement. But she has some reservations.

""While we currently provide our customers with certain financial services, including money orders, electronic funds transfers and cashing of U.S. Treasury checks, our core function is not banking,"" the agency said in a written statement. Get our weekly business news briefing >>

The service said it has an ""infrastructure that is not ideal as a banking platform,"" and cited a decline in visits to post offices. Plus, any investments outside of its core function of mail delivery ""will likely be scrutinized from both public policy and regulatory perspectives,"" the agency added.

The Postal Service is an independent agency that since 1971 has been required to rely on sales of stamps and other services to pay for its operations. But the growth of the Internet and competition from private shippers, such as FedEx Corp. and UPS, have taken a major toll on the agency's finances.

After peaking in 2006, total mail handled by the Postal Service has declined 27%. That has led to budget deficits, exacerbated by a congressional requirement to pre-fund retirement benefits for its workers, that have forced the agency to borrow up to its allowable limit of $15 billion from the U.S. Treasury.

Expanded financial services offer ""the single best opportunity for new revenue,"" according to the inspector general's office.

It's not a far-fetched idea. Post offices in many other nations, including Britain, France, China and Japan, also serve as banks. And from 1911 to 1967, the United States Postal Savings System offered accounts with annual interest capped at 2%, to reduce competition with commercial banks.

Deposits at U.S. postal banks surged during the Great Depression and World War II, when many consumers viewed the accounts as more secure than those in commercial banks. But as those banks opened more branches and increased interest rates after the war, the postal banking system fell out of favor and the federal government shut it down.

The Great Recession has led to calls for the revival of postal banks as many cash-strapped households have been forced to seek payday loans and other alternative financial products.

A Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. survey found that about 9.6 million households in 2013 had no one with a bank account. An additional 24.8 million households had accounts but also used alternative financial services, such as payday loans.

""It's harder for people with less money to use their money, and much more expensive,"" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of Georgia professor and author of the book ""How the Other Half Banks: Exclusion, Exploitation and the Threat to Democracy.""

Many poor areas lack bank branches, but most communities have a post office, said Katherine Isaac, a consultant to the postal workers union who has been organizing the Campaign for Postal Banking.

""Even if we put all the payday lenders out of business, there's a concern that there's still no place to go,"" Isaac said. ""The banks aren't there. They've abandoned those communities. But the post office is there.""

The Postal Service is the most popular federal agency — 84% of respondents have a positive view of it, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll.

""I would guess that a lot of people would trust the post office teller with their money more than these Wall Street traders,"" said Baradaran, an advocate for postal banks. ""There's a sense that the post office is a dinosaur, but it's not a shark.""

Congress would have to pass legislation allowing post offices to take deposits and make loans. But the Postal Service could use existing authority to increase some offerings, such as expanding check cashing to include other government and payroll checks and broadening money orders into bill payment service, supporters said.

""This is not a cash cow for the post office,"" Baradaran said. ""But it could save them.""

Fake 'Socialists' Pimp for Imperialist Sanders,Liberal,0,4u47cp,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4u47cp/fake_socialists_pimp_for_imperialist_sanders/,0,"The two main capitalist parties have effectively chosen their presumptive nominees for chief executive of U.S. imperialism. For the Republicans, it’s the bigoted, wealthy real estate mogul and reality TV star, now turned populist demagogue, Donald Trump. Obama’s former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the quintessential Democratic Party machine politician and imperialist warmonger, is the standard-bearer for the other party of war and racism.

A primary challenge to Clinton by “democratic socialist” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was embraced not only by many liberals but also by various self-proclaimed socialist groups. These reformists have bought and sold the claims by Sanders—who for a quarter century has caucused with the Democrats in Congress—that he stands for a “political revolution against the billionaire class.” His bid for the nomination having ended in failure, Sanders is now bargaining for concessions from the Clinton Democrats, including in the meaningless party platform.

Sanders attracted support from college and other petty-bourgeois youth, as well as a layer of workers, by inveighing against Wall Street and promoting reforms, such as free college tuition, Medicare for all, reducing student debt and a $15 an hour minimum wage. At the same time, he is a stalwart champion of bloody U.S. imperialism—from his support to the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force that launched the war on Afghanistan to his Senate vote endorsing the Israeli massacre of Palestinians in Gaza in 2014 (see “Bernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog,” WV No. 1083, 12 February). Like Trump, Sanders also pushes chauvinist protectionism, which serves to set workers in the U.S. against their class brothers and sisters abroad.

Many of those who support Sanders believe that his primary bid has launched a “movement” that represents some kind of challenge to the political establishment. In fact, Sanders has done everything to reinforce this establishment by refurbishing its image and reinforcing illusions and confidence in American capitalist democracy. He brought large numbers of disaffected young people “into the political process” (read: Democratic Party), for which he received a standing ovation from Senate Democrats on June 14. As Jeffrey St. Clair wrote in CounterPunch (10 June): “In fact, the Democrats were surely gratified to see Sanders out there, drawing attention to a dull and lifeless party that would otherwise have been totally eclipsed by the Trump media blitzkrieg. Sanders served the valuable function of energizing and registering on the Democratic Party rolls tens of thousands of new voters.”

To put it plainly: the pseudo-socialist groups that support Sanders have done their best, within the limits of their forces, to reinforce the ties that bind the working class politically to its class enemies. As revolutionary Marxists, we offer no political support on principle to any party of the bosses—not only the major parties of the U.S. ruling class, the Republicans and Democrats, but also small-time capitalist parties such as the Greens.

We fight to build a multiracial, revolutionary workers party, the necessary instrument to fight against the depredations of the capitalist system, including poverty, unemployment and racial oppression, as part of the struggle for socialist revolution. The irreconcilable conflict between the collective producers of social wealth and the capitalist class that exploits their labor is inherent in the capitalist system. While there has been little class struggle in this country for decades, workers’ potential power can be glimpsed in recent outbreaks such as the Verizon strike (see article, page 3)—as well as internationally with the victorious steel workers strike in Mexico or the upsurge of class battles in France. The key lies in making the working class conscious of its historic role as the gravedigger of the capitalist system, and of class society as a whole.

Such consciousness does not emerge spontaneously from the day-to-day struggles of the working class, which do not in themselves challenge the capitalist mode of production, but must be brought into the proletariat from the outside, through the instrumentality of a revolutionary workers party. The forging of such a workers party will result from convulsive class battles and social protests and the intervention of Marxists who underline that the interests of labor are directly counterposed to those of the capitalist class. The support offered by the trade-union bureaucracy and its reformist left tails to even the most “progressive” capitalist politician represents not a step in that direction but a fundamental obstacle to the necessary political independence of the working class from its class enemies.

Reformists Debate How Best to Betray

Sanders is a capitalist politician, but the reformist left is ecstatic about him because he “got socialism on dinner tables across the country,” as Charles Lenchner of People for Bernie put it at the recent Left Forum in New York. Socialist Alternative (SAlt) spent months doing donkey work inside the Sanders campaign. Throughout the primaries, SAlt continued to issue pro-Sanders propaganda while suggesting politely that it might behoove him to run as an independent rather than as a Democrat.

As the end loomed, SAlt’s Seattle city council member Kshama Sawant launched a petition pleading with Sanders to run as an independent. She shamelessly suggested that “if electing a Republican is really Bernie’s main concern, there is no reason he could not at least run in the 40+ states where it’s absolutely clear the Democratic or Republican candidate will win, while not putting his name on the 5-10 closely contested ‘swing states’” (movement4bernie.org). In other words, according to SAlt’s scheme, even running as a supposed independent, Sanders wouldn’t threaten an electoral win for the Democrats. SAlt’s pleas to the contrary, Sanders made clear before, during and after the primary battle that he refused to play the role of “spoiler.”

In his June 16 webcast effectively conceding the nomination, Sanders announced: “The major political task that we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly.” On June 24, he explicitly stated that he would vote for Clinton in November. Sanders’s fake-socialist backers are now left to figure out how to “fight the right” while trying to attract Bernie supporters repelled by the idea of voting for Clinton. Some of the contortions that result were on display at a May 21 debate at New York’s Left Forum between SAlt and the slightly more circumspect International Socialist Organization (ISO). The only substantive difference was whether to pressure the Democrats from inside or outside this capitalist party.

The ISO’s Jen Roesch zoomed in on how ridiculous it is for SAlt “to say you’re campaigning for Sanders, and supporting Sanders, but that you’re not helping to sign people up for the Democratic Party.” The ISO hastened to make clear that they, too, “felt the Bern.” As one ISOer put it, “Not endorsing Sanders has not stopped us from engaging with the campaign.” Like SAlt, Roesch made clear that the ISO’s main problem with Sanders is not his program or the class he represents, but only his running on the Democratic Party ticket.

During the discussion, a Spartacist supporter pointed to Sanders “supporting bloody American imperialism to the hilt,” a topic delicately avoided by the sundry reformists. He declared:

“Your debate is actually a farce because you both push illusions in bourgeois democracy, which is a screen for the brutal class exploitation inherent in capitalism; you both push illusions in incremental reforms of the capitalist state, which is fundamentally unreformable; and while you both talk about independence, for Marxists independence is a class question, and you both support capitalist politicians year after year, the ISO no less.”

While there is plenty to fear from a Trump presidency, to throw one’s vote to another competing capitalist politician is treason to the fight to defend the interests of working people and the oppressed.

In the end, both SAlt and the ISO came out for backing the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, as “a step toward building an alternative to the two-party system” (socialistworker.org, 25 May). The ISO has been deep in this small-time capitalist party for years. They not only campaigned for the anti-union populist Ralph Nader when he ran for president on its ticket in 2000, but also have themselves campaigned to be Green Party candidates (see “ISO Goes All the Way with Capitalist Greens,” WV No. 866, 17 March 2006). Although it may sound more radical than Sanders’s, the Green Party’s platform is nothing but bourgeois liberalism, devoted to a utopian-reactionary fantasy of small-scale capitalism hostile to economic growth.

For those disgruntled liberals who won’t hold their noses and vote for Clinton, the Greens provide a way station on the road back into the Democratic Party, typical of “progressive” bourgeois third parties in the U.S. An example can be found in 1948, as the Democratic Harry S. Truman administration was spearheading the anti-Soviet Cold War. Henry Wallace’s Progressive Party ran on a “pro-labor” stance and called for “friendship” with the Soviet Union. Wallace, who had been vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt, was supported by the Stalinist Communist Party under the rubric of the “anti-monopoly” coalition.

James P. Cannon, the founder of American Trotskyism, refuted the argument that Henry Wallace was not a capitalist candidate because the capitalists did not support him. At a 1948 Central Committee plenum of the then-Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, Cannon remarked:

“The class character of the party is determined first by its program; secondly by its actual policy in practice; and thirdly by its composition and control. The Wallace party is bourgeois on all these counts.... We have to stir up the workers against this imposter, and explain to them that they will never get a party of their own by accepting substitutes.”

For more on Wallace, see “On Bourgeois ‘Third Parties’ and the 1948 Henry Wallace Campaign,” WV No. 918, 1 August 2008.

The Fight for Socialism

While hypocritically condemning Trump’s racist poison against blacks, Muslims and immigrants, the Democrats are actually carrying out much of what he spouts. Obama has deported millions of immigrants, more than any other president. His warplanes, drones and special forces have butchered thousands (mainly Muslims) in the American “national interest,” while at home his administration has been leading the assault on democratic rights under the guise of the “war on terror.” Trump raves against China in the name of “America First,” but it is Obama who has slapped massive tariffs on Chinese steel and is ramping up military and economic pressure with the aim of destroying this most powerful of the remaining deformed workers states.

Unlike every other major industrialized country, the U.S. has never had a mass workers party representing even a deformed expression of the political independence of the proletariat. As Gore Vidal, the late great American author (and no Marxist), put it in 1972: “We have only one political party in the U.S., the Property Party, with two right wings, Republican and Democrat” (Imperial America, 2004).

The central enduring feature of American capitalism, shaping and perpetuating this backward consciousness, is the structural oppression of the black population as a race-color caste, the majority of which is forcibly segregated at the bottom of society. Black oppression, with its profound and pervasive ideological effects, is fundamental to the American capitalist order. Obscuring the fundamental class division between the capitalists who own the means of production and the working class who must sell their labor power to survive, racism and white supremacy have served to bind white workers to their capitalist exploiters with the illusion of a commonality of interest based on skin color.

Today the Black Lives Matter current is enmeshed in a strategy of lobbying the Democrats, whether Sanders or Clinton, in a futile attempt to reform the police—which exist precisely to enforce racist, capitalist rule. The road to black liberation lies rather through mobilizing the social power of the multiracial working class, which cannot liberate itself from wage slavery without fighting to end the racial oppression of black people. In this struggle, black workers, heavily represented in the most militant ranks of organized labor and forming a human link to the impoverished ghetto masses, are slated to play a leading role.

The party we fight for is a multiracial, internationalist, proletarian party capable of leading the working class, at the head of all the oppressed, in the struggle for a victorious socialist revolution. On an international scale, working-class rule would lay the material basis for a global society without classes, in which material plenty has made poverty a thing of the past, imperialist wars are no longer possible and race and ethnicity have ceased to have any social significance. Such a party will be forged over the political corpses of those who pervert “socialism” into a tool to defend the current outlived social order.

Communist Inc. - Has it been tried?,Liberal,4,pal8w,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/pal8w/communist_inc_has_it_been_tried/,5,"Not trolling.

This was probably already covered somewhere (and if so a link would be cool)...

Why wouldn't Communist in, say the USA, start their own corporation. Let's say it has x billion shares (tax purposes - need to hand out the shares before they gain value).

Each share is non-transferable, already distributed and in-active until activated by the owner of the share (other rules could apply). At anytime a person can de-active (and of course re-activate) their share as they see fit (all logistics easily computerized).

Initially, the corporation could purchase existing manufacturing companies in areas that have over-capacity. For example, a toilet paper factory. Hopefully, in this example, this would provide toilet paper for all company owners who have activated their share: you never have to buy toilet paper again. Why over capacity? Because you can get a good deal on these types of factories. Those people working at the existing factory have their share activated meaning they now own the factory they work in (more complex than this cause they would still need to be paid in some manner but this is the basic idea).

What assets to purchase next would be determined by a vote of active share holders (again, logistics which can be computerized).

Over the years, Communist Inc. could own car manufacturing facilities, logistic companies, dentist offices, hospitals, schools, air lines, mass transit systems, etc. Cars, as an example, manufactured would belong to Communist Inc. and be usable by everyone (if they even decide to make cars: maybe mass transit is better, etc.). Communist Inc. could even sell those cars to people that have not activated providing Communist Inc. with more capital.

Hopefully, at some point, the needs of all those within Communist Inc. would be fully covered by the corporation and being the company is owned by everyone equally, there is no chance of one person gaining enough power to become corrupted.

Just a though from a few nights ago.

Background on Humanitarian Law Project v. Holder

 

CCR challenged sections of the “material support” statute (18 U.S.C. § 2339B) on behalf of various groups and individuals who had provided and wanted to continue providing  nonviolent dispute resolution training, humanitarian aid, and other similar services to foreign organizations on the State Department’s designated terrorist list. CCR argued that these sections of the material support statute violated the First Amendment and criminalized lawful and non-violent activities that might actually promote solutions to conflicts.

 

While multiple lower courts had found language in the material support statute to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, last June the Supreme Court overturned these decisions, finding the law to be constitutional. The Court allowed the vague language to remain in the statute, raising concern that peaceful solidarity and humanitarian work could be criminalized.

 

Since this Supreme Court decision, various groups doing international solidarity work or providing humanitarian aid have sought to understand how it could impact them.  Concerns have only heightened since the September 2010 FBI raids on Palestine and Colombia solidarity activists and the recent reactivation of subpoenas investigating their activities.

 

CCR will be hosting a series of calls where activists, aid workers, and others can submit questions via email and get answers from our attorneys regarding the Supreme Court’s Humanitarian Law Project decision and its implications.

 

Know your rights.  Please join us for the first call on Wednesday, December 8 at 5pm EST.

"Right Wing Populism, the Possibility of a Right Wing 
Take Over and the Hope for Revolution in the US",Liberal,3,b42rv,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/b42rv/right_wing_populism_the_possibility_of_a_right/,0,"I think a little materialist analysis on the current state of US politics is in order. I propose a discusion thread here, in order to get different viewpoints.

During the 2004 presidential race the Revolutionary Communist Party had an interesting analysis. Basically it predicted that the Republicans would be successful in the theft of the election because hte Democrats would refuse to activate and call out their base into the streets election night. Generally this came true, Ohio was stolen, the Democrats, for fear of their base, and not wanting to begin a ""arms race"" of activist from both parties, as well as a fear of losing control of the base, they refused to call out their people.

Jump to the Obama election and there, they truly called their people out in every major city in the US. 250,000 in Chicago, 40k in DC, 50k in NYC, etc. THe Republicans had no hope of pulling off a theft of the election, major riots and a coup may have occurred. 

Thus the green light for calling out the most wild lunatics you can imagine was given. The right called them out. Groups like the OathKeepers (which many on the left seem to identify with, they are a group of active military that swear to uphold the constitution, in reality they decide the constitutionality of what they decide.) the TEA Partiers, and many others, the rise of rhetoric and populism has taken hold, mixed with conspircism and demogogary the proletariate have been bombarded with.

Does this constitute the possibility for a truly fascist takeover, either by the military in the US, or through continued legislation? Will that make it easier to activate and bring forward people to a communist world of liberation and the end of oppression?

"Analogy of two friends fighting violently, and what we should do.",Conservative,0,t4o0rg,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/t4o0rg/analogy_of_two_friends_fighting_violently_and/,21,"I heard this in the news about that the Chinese Foreign Ministers said something like the following:

>When two people are fighting violently, what do you do? Is it proper to start handing out weapons to either side? No, the better solution is to stop them, and make them talk, communicate and solve the problem without taking a side.

I just wanted to know what you guys think about the actions of the other countries assisting Ukraine with military weapons and about this quote. I suppose they are already doing their communication part. Is it better for us not selling/giving weapons to Ukraine? And should we (according to the quote) stop them by **sending troops** to Ukraine, to **protect the area** while we are doing the negotiations. And doing this without harming anything Russian that is outside of the lands of Ukraine (without taking sides nor harming any part).

What do you think about this view of the Chinese Foreign Ministers? This is a question about global politics in comparison with common morals. I think this is worth discussing.

EDIT: Just to clear things up. Both Russia and Ukraine can do what they do, and we as the audience of the fight should go in and stop the fight by dragging on their backs, and NOT by giving them more lethal weapons to fight. This is, according to the analogy.",1646184267.0

That should be enough of a disclaimer however we have reached a post 9/11 level of fervor where any mention of why Russia is doing this is automatically perceived as defending Russian/Putin. I don’t know how much of this is purely organic which I’m sure most of this is, and how much of this is both organic but also fueled by bots and war propaganda as after people took notice of reddits ‘power’ in 2015-2016 this site has long been compromised.

However I did want to review the History of this so people have a better understanding as to why. Most people have made the claim ‘Putin wants to re-create the USSR all of eastern Europe is next’ this is not true whatsoever and on the level of “they hate us for our freedom” so people need to know why. Much like with Bin Laden, going over why Bin Laden did was often see as ‘justifying 9/11’ as we can see here in the famous Paul-Giuliani moment. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7dnFDdwu0).

However I want to re-state again so it is perfectly clear THIS IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR WAGING WAR ON A COUNTRY WHO HAS NOT ATTACKED YOU.

This is probably one of the first foreign policy issues I can remember I got dead wrong. I thought no way Russia was going to march to Kiev. Not to say I’m some crazy expert whose never wrong, but I never been wrong to this level so naturally I had to reflect and do additional research on why that is.

Now from here on I put aside my views and will discuss the History of how we got here and Russia’s motivations and from a pure Machiavellian sense and after doing my research quite frankly I’m surprised the invasion took this long.

\*\*The motivations\*\*

There are 4 main motivations when taken individually some are enough on their own are enough for Russia to invade however together it makes it inevitable. The 4 are:

Nationalistic – The Russia state originated with the Kievan-Rus. Therefore bringing it back into Russia proper would be a glorious accomplishment for the motherland (again remember I’m talking in an analysis sense I don’t believe that but from here on out I put myself in Russia’s shoes so last time im disclaiming). However Russian nationalism is probably the weakest point and would not be enough.

Strategic

Economic

Demographics

**Nationalistic**

I briefly described this but lets delve further. As a an-cap I hate nation states and would be fine with decentralizing as much as possible. I say this because this point is factual but will anger many. Ukraine has never actually been its own country throughout history. Ukraine was not a country until 1917. Prior to that the area of Ukraine traded hands from the Rus to Lithuania, Poland, the Mongols and Russia. However notice the year, 1917. This was the start of the Russian Revolution. To not go too deep from modern Russia perspective Ukraine was entirely a by product of the Bolsheviks, and the separation is viewed by many Russians INCLUDING PUTIN HIMSELF as a tragedy splitting the Russian people. This is why the notion of ‘Russia wants the USSR back’ is false. It is a motivation of re-uniting an empire but not the USSR but the Russian Empire. Now of course Ukraine splitting was no problem for the Soviets. It was basically an administrative division and if it reduced the people there from causing any revolts why not let them call themselves Ukraine? Of course that changed with the collapse of the Soviet Union. When Ukraine broke away even if Russia wanted to split it and reclaim parts of the east as in the new Russian State they were in 0 position to do so.

This is a good point to jump into the strategic point, as when the Soviet Union collapsed the idea Ukraine would be out of the Russian sphere of influence and in the US and western Europe was not in the realm of possibility. Plus they had ‘the promise’.

**Strategic**

Lets start with the ever controversial ‘promise. An alleged verbal promise from HWB that NATO would not expand any further to the east. Now there are many counter arguments people have made to this to dismiss it. “It wasn’t written down so not valid” “it was made to the USSR and they dissolved” “NATO is a defensive alliance and countries fear Russia so its justified”. Now with making no judgement to the validity of those arguments, they don’t matter. This is seen often in our politics as well. Were talking about people here, you can make those arguments but to Russia those are irrelevant, THEY BELIEVE the US made that promise and BROKE IT betraying them and lying to them. Whether it was made/valid etc. doesn’t matter in this context, that is their position.

NATO then expanded east taking most of the Warsaw pact with it and now is looking to add Ukraine right on Russia’s border. Why is Ukraine so important strategically though?  They already have NATO countries like Lithuania etc. border them to the north west so we can dismiss “on our border” claim right? Well yes and no, that is the simplistic version of it.

Look at a map. Belarus is aligned with Russia and much like eastern Ukraine was historically part of Russia therefore in this context its an extension of the Russian defensive plan. In the event of conflict with NATO Russia is in a position to cut these countries off from the west through Belarus leaving only the sea to access. In addition they are much smaller countries so in the event of conflict Russia can at best quickly pacify that area or at the very least heavily restrict any attempts to use it as a staging ground for an invasion, therefore their NATO presence is tolerable to Russia.

Now lets look at Ukraine. First off in the event Ukraine is part of NATO then Belarus is surrounded on three sides by NATO. Making them unable to cut those countries off and make Belarus indefensible. This alone is a major strategic concern.

However the biggest has to do with geo-geography and a major reason for ever Russian conquest in eastern Europe in their entire history, the European Plain. Stretching throughout Europe to the Ural Mountains east of Moscow in Siberia this is long flat land that is difficult to defend. From eastern Germany to Russia this acts as a funnel. The mouth starts in eastern Germany and ends in the Ural Mountains. This funnel opens from Germany to Ukraine/Belarus widening to include all of Russia by the time you get to their border.

Russian military strategy has always rested in keeping the mouth of this funnel as small as possible. During the USSR, this was at its smallest point with Soviet control of east Germany. Fast forward to today with Ukraine in Russia’s sphere of influence that funnel is still manageable by Russia with Ukraine and Belarus providing a good buffer. The Carpathian Mts. In western Ukraine makes that funnel small, but with Ukraine in NATO the funnel is completely unmanageable. \[Look at this map to demonstrate how much this changes Russian defensive doctrine.\]([https://ibb.co/VvfYf8n](https://ibb.co/VvfYf8n))

As you can see from a pure strategic perspective Ukraine in NATO basically turns a war with NATO from a war they will probably lose but if they could hold the line they can make the war hard enough to sue for peace to a completely indefensible border. From the perspective of the Russians, this alone is enough of a threat and untenable.

**3. Economic**

Russia is Europe’s only Petro-State. Must like the ME Russia economy rests on their oil and natural gas reserves. Europe being the main buyers. With the Soviet break up Russia’s pipelines ran through Ukraine. Russia has had to pay billions in tariffs for transporting through Ukraine. However by 2024 with all the new pipelines since then Russia was on track to not have to use those Ukraine pipelines. Ukraine prior to 2012 had no major energy reserves like Russia. However that changed, it was discovered on the coast of Crimea and south west Ukraine HUGE amounts of natural gas. Combined with the advent of fracking making shale viable in the Donbass region and near the Carpathian mountain range Ukraine went from no energy industry to having the 14th largest reserves.

As you can see this presents huge economic consequences for Russia, if Ukraine is no longer in their influence and develops these reserves the economic implications would be devastating as Ukraine becomes a major gas supplier to Europe. After discovery European money poured in to build out these reserves.

Now disclaimer there isn’t enough solid evidence of this to make the claim there is some however. Also knowing history it wouldn’t be a surprise. This discovery of natural resources with having a pro-russian president made the possibility Russia could at least have a hand in developing and benefiting from it. However a 2014 revolution in which a pro-west government was installed would hurt Russia and benefit the US and Europe. I was not aware of how big these reserves and impact to Russia was. Therefore the idea that the CIA or other western groups had a hand in the 2014 revolution… seems extremely plausible. Also makes the actions of the Biden in Ukraine more questionable, now I know there are many dems here who will take major offense to that but… come on how many wars/governments have we overthrown for oil. Can we at least entertain the possibility that the opportunity to get Europe off Russia gas and cripple Russia economically is probably one of the biggest opportunities both in impact to Russia and benefit to the US Empire we have ever seen? If I was a statist neo-con I would quite frankly be pissed off if the CIA made 0 attempt to get rid of Russian influence in Ukraine.

Regardless that change in government lead Russia to take cinema in 2014 and support Ethnic Russian Rebels in Donbass in the east. Which includes 2/3rds of the gas locations.

Sidenote: Crimea gets all of its water from a Soviet era Canal to Ukraine, that was dammed by Ukraine after Russia takeover. Life in Crimea due to that has gotten worse since Russian takeover, including their worst drought in recorded history therefore in order to keep Crimea invading Ukraine and blowing that dam (which they have done so far already) was a major motivation as well.

**4. Demographics.**

This one is also another weak one but worth mentioning. Like much of the Western World, but worse, Russia is suffering from low birth rates. COVID accelerated that in Russia as well. Therefore there is the idea the Russian Army may be getting smaller and smaller as the years go by so they need to have the ability.

**Timing and combining the reason.**

Let’s talk about timing. In 2014 the Syrian civil war was going on. Therefore a total invasion of Ukraine and conducting two major operations at the same time probably did not appeal to Russia. For now they could take Crimea which from a strategic standpoint in there mind could not be lost under any circumstances. In addition they would support separatist ethnic Russians in the Donbass. They took Crimea firing only one warning shot and didn’t have a major operation in Donbass so resource wise it was as much as they can get for as little effort as possible and gave Russia 2/3rds of those gas reserves. Also this revolution just happened, therefore I’m sure they hoped that the situation could change and a new pro-Russian government would come.

Now fast forward to today. The US and others only pushed harder and harder for Ukraine to eventually join NATO and be pro-west so the idea they would go back to being pro-russian slowly died. In addition the Syrian civil war, although not completely over is no longer the major conflict it was with Assad now off his heels. In addition I think US politics played a major factor. Prior to Trump and even after the 2014 invasion, the American people didn’t necessarily like Russia however were largely indifferent to them and the cold war hatred had largely died down. With the “Russia Collusion” “Trump is Putins puppet” allegations that whipped the entire Democratic party into a firmly anti-Russian stance. However Putin may have hoped after Biden got elected these would now die off a bit but it has only stayed the same or increased.

With those facts comes demographics and Ukraine’s military. Even without Ukraine fully joining NATO the NATO nations have supported Ukraine and have been providing them with weapons, equipment, and training. In addition, if they were able to re-gain control over those gas reserves and get more wealthy the Ukrainian military would only get stronger and stronger while the demographics in Russia getting weaker and weaker.

With the military no longer engaged in any other conflict, the US becoming increasingly hostile to Russia, the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO leaving them completely vulnerable on their entire western border, Russia built up troops along Ukraine for his invasion with possibly the hope he could get an agreement at a minimum that Ukraine never join NATO. When the West basically said that promise would never happen the Russian’s in their mind for the future security of Russia both militarily and economically had no choice but to invade Ukraine. Now since this is the end I will just repeat that of course IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION OF INVASION this is all purely from a Russian statist perspective.",1646161557.0

Why is it common for libertarians to align with Republicans?,Conservative,0,t31iy9,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/t31iy9/why_is_it_common_for_libertarians_to_align_with/,42,"I've considered myself a libertarian since senior year in high school (about to be 26 in a few days) but I've never aligned or supported most views of Republicans. I'm all for a smaller government and I'm all for personal freedoms, but it seems recently libertarians started choosing sides between liberals and conservatives and a lot along with conservatives since they're always publicly scrutinizing the governments role with the pandemic. 

I'm all for masks, I'm all for vaccines, because I understand this is needed in order to better the livelihoods of everyone, not only worried about myself and what I want. We as humans are not individually able to make a working system to combat this and that's obvious considering it's 2 years already and we're practically in square one. 

Not going to argue about this tho. It's pointless and it isn't the point. My question is why do a lot of us align ourselves with these conspiracy theory conservatives that are judgemental about anything and everything, while also commonly not accepting anything that doesnt align with their ideologies and limited world experience? I mean half of these conservatives (being moderate) have racial views or a lack of racial awareness and understanding. A lot of them are actively and public racist. A lot of them are even starting to don racial flags/sayings ynser the guise of conservatism. 

Don't tread on me? That has always been a racial thing until adopted by the libertarian party. Why did we adopt a flag with such a deep racial background? By doing that you're aligning yourself with the racist south protesting government involvement and the racist state rights to own slaves. This is what we're really aligning ourselves with?? Really?? 

To be honest I don't choose a political party often. I believe in things from democracy, libertarian, even Marxism and communism. But I just can't understand why we so often support and help conservatives? Conversatives don't truly support or like freedom any more than democrats and that's obvious. And no I don't support liberals either. They are doing some crazy shit to this society. However a lot of them are vastly more open minded and push for freedom than a republican does. 

So I'm just asking why is this a common thing?",1646006398.0

It's good to see New Mexico setting a standard for teacher salaries. Though we'd like to see even higher salaries for teachers, New Mexico's cost of living is below average, ranked as the [12th most affordable state to live in](https://meric.mo.gov/data/cost-living-data-series) (12/50 most affordable to least affordable). The tiers too are a good way to ensure that all teachers make a livable wage across the state. As a comparison, I live in California, the 3rd most expensive state to live in (48/50 on a scale of most affordable to least affordable), and I make $56,000 a year with a masters degree as a 5th year teacher. This is less than New Mexico's 2nd tier.

"I wrote a paper about the Kyle Rittenhouse Trial (I know a little late), what do you think? Anything I missed or got wrong?",Conservative,4,t2jkmb,conservatives,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/t2jkmb/i_wrote_a_paper_about_the_kyle_rittenhouse_trial/,4,"  

The Kenosha Riots and all of the subsequent press came just 3 months after the death of George Floyd. To say the least the country was in a flurry of ideas and action taken in regard to racial justice and the rising racial tensions. While not directly the cause for the now infamous riot in Kenosha, it did certainly help stir it up and explode the aftermath, being the Rittenhouse trial into nationwide fame. So now, we come to this, the case of Kyle Rittenhouse. Though officially acquitted of all charges on November 19th, was he really innocent? And was there anything the court missed?

There are two sides to the trial, the defense, and the prosecution. Their arguments will be summed up here. The Prosecution – His (Kyle Rittenhouse) possession of the Armalite Rifle 15 (AR-15) used in the shooting was illegal, He came to the riots (Kenosha riots) with the intent of killing rioters, He “shouldn’t have been in Kenosha”, and he was under no substantial threat from Joseph Rosenbaum (dead), Anthony Huber (dead), and or Gaige Grosskreutz (injured), the three people he shot. The Defense – All of the prosecution’s claims are false, more specifically, His possession and use of an AR-15 is legal, He acted purely in self-defense, and he “belongs” in Kenosha.

Before any arguments can be thoroughly analyzed however, one must set the scene so any statement made in regards to the case can be easily understood. So first off, the exposition, On the afternoon of August 24th, a day after the start of the Kenosha riots, Kyle Rittenhouse drove to Kenosha Wisconsin from his hometown, Antioch Illinois, to stay with his friend Dominick Black. The next day they both went out to help clean graffiti off a local high school. As the evening drew on Kyle Rittenhouse provided medical care and put out dumpster fires at some time acquiring his AR-15 rifle which he had purchased through Dominick Black earlier that year. He and his group of multiple armed individuals continued to put out fires and try to prevent destruction of property in the area such as the Car Source business which had lost 1.5 million U.S. dollars in damages the earlier night.

Shooting #1 - as the time approached midnight. Rittenhouse was walking down Sheridan Road, Joseph Rosenbaum spotted Rittenhouse and proceeded to chase after him. Rittenhouse seeing this, ran into the parking lot of the “Bert and Rudy’s” Auto service business on the corner of Sheridan Road and 63rd Street. Rosenbaum at this time threw a plastic bag containing most likely, socks, deodorant, and underwear at Rittenhouse. Joshua Ziminski, a random protestor then fired a gun shot into the air, unrelated to the chase. Rittenhouse then turned around, now midway through the parking lot and pointed his firearm at Rosenbaum. After Rosenbaum continued running at Rittenhouse unaffected, he turned back around and ran towards a group of parked cars in the corner of the parking lot at the side of the business. Rittenhouse decelerated as he neared the cars, turning around with Rosenbaum less than 10 feet behind and continuing toward him, he raised his AR-15 rifle and fired 4 shots in less than a quarter of a second, killing Rosenbaum instantly. Rittenhouse then jogged from between the parked cars and around back to the now dead Rosenbaum. Richie McGinniss, a bystander, then tried to help Rosenbaum as Rittenhouse stood over the body. Rittenhouse at this time called his friend Dominick Black telling him “I just killed somebody” before proceeding to run back up Sheridan Road, towards the police line. 

Shooting #2 - Word spread fast among the protestors that Rittenhouse had just killed a man, and after getting just one tenth of a mile from the first shooting, he is attacked again, at the corner of 61st and Sheridan Road. A group of protestors now hurriedly ran towards Rittenhouse, shouting “get him”, “he just shot someone”, “get his a\*s”. A protestor ran up to and hit Rittenhouse in the back of the head, knocking his cap off. Rittenhouse ran further until tripping and falling down. As Rittenhouse turned around, sitting up, Maurice Freeland jumped over him and kicked Rittenhouse in the upper body whether that be the arms or the head. Rittenhouse then, as Freeland was midway through the maneuver, fired two shots at him in around half a second, missing both. Directly after this, Anthony Huber went in to hit Rittenhouse with his skateboard. Huber managed to hit Rittenhouse on the shoulder and while doing so with his left hand purportedly grabbed Rittenhouse’s gun. He then however, tripped on Rittenhouse’s legs, falling nearly to the ground, his skateboard held in his right hand, falling flat on the pavement, brushing up against it for a just a moment. Huber continued on his original trajectory, hurriedly getting up again with his hand seemingly still gripping Rittenhouse’s rifle. It is at this point that Rittenhouse, now on his back, then fired a single shot at Huber, muffled due to the proximity to Hubers chest, the shot went through his thorax hitting a multitude of vital organs. Huber now dying, released his supposed grip on Rittenhouse’s rifle and his skateboard, both hands reaching towards his chest. He continued forward for a couple more steps before lying down on the ground and dying. Gaige Grosskreutz, who had been running towards Rittenhouse, stopped and ducked as the shot that killed Huber was fired. Grosskreutz was now just to the left of Rittenhouse holding a pistol but with both hands raised, slowly straightening back up from his ducking position. Rittenhouse at this moment, after seeing Grosskreutz with both hands in the air sat back up with his rifle pointed towards the ground. Grosskreutz then almost immediately put his hands down, hopping into a jog circling to the back of Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse spotted this in the corner of his eye, rapidly swiveling to face Grosskreutz. Grosskreutz now had his gun pointed towards Rittenhouse and his unoccupied left hand nearly in front of Rittenhouse’s AR-15. Rittenhouse at this point then fired a single shot into Grosskreutz’s right bicep, disabling his right arm as he turned the other way crutching it in is left hand, still holding the gun in his right. Rittenhouse then with no other immediate threats to him, stood up onto his feet and started walking again to the police line. Swiveling and looking around for any other assailants, he then broke into a jog before then again returning to walking and lifting his hands into the air for the police. Rittenhouse approached a police cruiser at this point trying to surrender himself. The police, not understanding, and insisting that he move out of the way so they could go deal with any injured civilians or the active shootout (which they did not know by now had ended) pepper sprayed Rittenhouse. Afterwards, Rittenhouse met up with his friend Dominick Black who drove him back to his hometown, where Rittenhouse then promptly turned himself in to a police station, just a hour after the shooting.

Now, to the guilt of Kyle Rittenhouse.

First off, was Rittenhouse’s possession of an AR-15 illegal? In the state of Wisconsin local laws prohibit the possession of firearms by minors but only to an extent. The law states that minors cannot own *short barreled* shotguns and rifles and because Rittenhouse’s AR-15 had a barrel longer than 16 inches, it was legal for him to own and accordingly open carry, as Wisconsin is an open carry state. It is important to note also that this means while Rittenhouse could not purchase a firearm legally at the time, it was completely legal for his friend Dominick Black to do so for him and as well that both Illinois and Wisconsin laws do not prohibit the carrying of firearms across state lines. Now, the rest of the charges are somewhat opinionated, there legal basis relying on whether or not Rittenhouse provoked the attacks (“A person who provokes an attack, whether by lawful or unlawful conduct, with intent to use such an attack as an excuse to cause death or great bodily harm to his or her assailant is not entitled to claim the privilege of self-defense.”) or if he acted “reasonably”, in order to stop the threat facing him (“a person is privileged to point a gun at another person in self-defense if the person reasonably believes that the threat of force is necessary to prevent or terminate what he or she reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference”). As one can see, “reasonably”, is a very opinionated word, so, while I can provide the evidence, ultimately, I cannot say for certain, whether or not he was “innocent” regarding these charges, besides merely expressing my *thoughts* on the matter. So, did Rittenhouse belong in Kenosha and subsequently, have good intent? Kyle Rittenhouse’s father, Mike Rittenhouse (divorced), lives in Kenosha Wisconsin and Rittenhouse visited frequently. As well as this, Kenosha is merely 21 miles from Antioch, around a 30-minute drive. These two facts bring reasonable significance to the town of Kenosha for Rittenhouse, and it can be assumed then that he had a will to protect the town. Now, for the really important part, did Rittenhouse provoke any of the attacks from the 3 assailants he injured/killed, and did he use reasonable force? Rosenbaum very openly disliked Rittenhouse for putting out a dumpster fire with a fire extinguisher which Rosenbaum was seen pushing earlier. Justice and Dylan Putnum both at the scene of the dumpster fire earlier that day (August 25th), were quoted as saying Rosenbaum said “why did you do that” in an enraged manor to Rittenhouse. There is no evidence of any other act Rittenhouse did to provoke Rosenbaum. From this, one can ascertain that Rittenhouse didn’t mean to upset Rosenbaum to the point of getting in a physical confrontation. It is more likely that Rosenbaum started the conflict with Rittenhouse being that he was seen visibly agitated at Rittenhouse and had a lengthy criminal record, including sexual misconduct with minors and extensive violations in prison, being of such nature as assault on staff (10 counts), disobeying orders (15 counts), and even one count of arson, along with a plethora of other infractions clearly showing him to be of a more violent nature, as well, there is significant evidence that he was off his medication at the time. The incentives of Huber and Grosskreutz would be harder to pinpoint. While they could also be angry at Rittenhouse for disturbing their rioting. One could also argue that they, as Grosskreutz has testified, were trying to stop what they viewed as an “active shooter”. Ultimately though, there two incentives would not matter, in terms of whether or not Rittenhouse provoked the attack as their interactions with Rittenhouse are captured clearly on video and Rittenhouse’s earlier shooting of Rosenbaum leading to the possible mis-assessment of the scene by Huber and Grosskreutz would be excused if Rittenhouse acted reasonably in self-defense. Finally, besides the “active shooter” explanation, there is no evidence Rittenhouse did anything else to provoke Huber and Grosskreutz. Now finally, was Rittenhouse justified in his carrying out of self-defense? Rittenhouse ran from Rosenbaum, tried to deter him by pointing his rifle at him, and continued on running until Rosenbaum was less than 10 feet away. 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse could either then, in this situation, have a possibly fatal brawl with 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum, or shoot him. Which decision one considers reasonable is up to them but Rittenhouse’s attempts at escaping and dissuading the ensuing Rosenbaum as to not have to make this decision should be taken into account. Rittenhouse ended up firing 4 shots at Rosenbaum, this could be classified as overkill, but considering that the shots were rapid, within a space of a quarter of a second, and Rittenhouse was likely very nervous, it could well be attributed to his elevated levels of stress and the very close proximity of Rosenbaum. Rittenhouse from this point on was very restrained, firing the same amount of shots as he had at Rosenbaum but dispersed among three separate targets. Rittenhouse was either on his back or butt when he made the rest of his final shots, his targets being either on top of him or just a foot or two away. Rittenhouse was cornered in a sense, surrounded by rioters and soon to be engulfed, likely severely injured or killed if he did not act.

Now for the conclusion. So, was Kyle Rittenhouse innocent? It appears he was. On all accounts, His possession and use of his AR-15, was legal, He acted purely in self-defense, and he belonged in Kenosha on that night. Well, I hope you enjoyed reading and have gained a renewed perspective of the Rittenhouse case.

Republican leaders are abandoning core tenets of American democracy even as the stakes in the global contest between democracy and autocracy are clearer and higher than at any time since the end of the Cold War.              They are defending coup-plotters and curbing voting rights while Russia tries to crush Ukraine’s fragile democracy and China menaces not only Taiwan but democracies everywhere, from Australia to Lithuania.

The scope of that wider struggle was on vivid display on February 4.       In Beijing, the world’s two most powerful autocrats—Putin and China’s Xi Jinping—cemented their deepening alliance.          In the United States, where American leaders should have been unified in championing democracy against these aggressive adversaries, the opposite happened:        The Republican National Committee formally declared the violent insurrection of January 6, 2021, to be     “legitimate political discourse.”

It was dismaying but not surprising that Trump praised Putin’s move to recognize and occupy separatist enclaves in Ukraine as “genius” and “savvy.”       But even Republican leaders who still take a Reaganesque view of America’s role in the world and talk a good game about deterring Russia and competing with China are undercutting those goals by   aiding and abetting Trump’s attacks on America’s democratic institutions.

Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri rails often against China and has said the United States should “lead the free world” to confront a Chinese Communist Party that is “a menace to all free peoples.”           Yet Hawley led the effort in Congress to overturn the 2020 election, and the image of his raised fist saluting insurrectionists on January 6 is an indelible memory of that dark day for American democracy.

1. Sanctions have a negative impact. Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea have an embargo and nothing good has come out of that situation, historically sanctions don't have the impact politicians think will have. Only civilians (from sanctioned and sanctioning countries) suffer. In this specific case, the price of oil will radically increase, it could even reach 150$, that will be bad for everyone.
2. NATO is a corrupt imperialist organization, NATO has lied in the past and will continue to do it to. The lied in Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and Yemen. They have massively financed the military industrial complex. The US energy sector also has interests in war, with Russia out of the way the US will be (by far) the most important supplier of energy to Europe.
3. Putin is a fascist and an authoritarian, his actions are NOT justified.
4. The ongoing centralized military is a horrible way to prevent foreign attacks, historically Ukrainian citizens have had their right to bear arms extremely limited by government licenses and prohibitions, it has always been illegal to own military caliber weapons, the citizens are defenseless against invasion. Organized and decentralized guerrillas are a much better way to defend against foreign invasions like Vietnam did against the US.
5. Ukraine has dangerous Neo nazi groups which are relatively small, but if NATO continues to finance them and they win the conflict, it could have similar consequences as in Afghanistan with the Mujahideen.

Is a one world government the only way to end war and tyranny?,Conservative,0,t1d4ot,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/t1d4ot/is_a_one_world_government_the_only_way_to_end_war/,10,"This is not bait. Just consider this for a moment. First, ask yourself what libertarian government is. To me it means ruling by consent rather than by coercion; meaning that a government is obeyed because its citizens recognize it as legitimate. If some citizens no longer consent to the government's rule, they can either try to change the way it is run, or they can leave. Leaving could mean either moving or seceding to another jurisdiction. In essence, self-determination. A truly libertarian state can only be one which allows self-determination within its own borders.

Consider the current situation in Ukraine. It originates from 2014 when some people who did not consent to the rule of the Ukrainian government attempted to overthrow it. However there were others, notably in the eastern provinces, who did not wish to be under the new government. This resulted in at least some genuine desire for secession, which Russia used as a pretext for its occupation of Crimea and now full-blown war.

However Russia is not the only state being tyrannical, although arguably much more more so. The Ukrainian government was reluctant to allow Crimea and Donbas to secede. If a fair referendum were conducted and Crimea, Donbas or any other region decided to secede, it would be tyrannical to force them to stay under the Ukrainian government. There was also the proposal to vote on making Ukraine a federation, which was ignored. If that had happened, perhaps the secessionist movements would've dissipated.

Of course the real problem is the monopoly on violence. After Russia occupied Crimea, there was a referendum, but who knows what the real results were. It didn't matter, because Russia occupies Crimea by force and therefore will retain its rule. The same can be said of regions within Ukraine which wish to join Russia or become independent. We don't even know which regions these are, as there isn't a neutral government to oversee and enforce fair referendums. This whole thing, as with most wars, is merely deciding which tyrannical state gets to force which areas into submission.

I think the only way to avoid this is to have a one world government with an absolute monopoly on violence, but which only uses force to ensure that self-determination is upheld. Something like the UN, but instead of drafting worthless ""international law"", it could actually stop (or preferably prevent) aggression like what is going on in Ukraine, and ensure that a democratic process of determining statehood takes place in each region. How to actually accomplish such a government without it becoming tyrannical itself is another thing. But does this make sense to anyone else, or do you think there's another way?",1645819592.0

stupid pro-murder arguments from pro abortionists


""if you don't have a vagina you can't comment on abortion""

like what??


""If you've never committed sexual assault you aren't allowed to comment on sexual assault"" 🙄 

These anti-science arguments never make any sense LOL

""I won't trust my gynecologist because he doesn't have a vagina!""

""oh mr doctor- have you ever HAD cancer?! then what makes u qualified to tell me my diagnosis?""

""has that dog trainer ever been a dog?? then how does he know what works and what doesn't?""

u don't have to BE something to be able to study how it works.

in fact most of these men making abortion laws are actually MORE qualified than the screening feminist with a protest sign..

these female supremacist arguments are full of egotistical narcissism as if bleeding out ur vagina somehow makes u a scientific expert lol. 

Why, if an organism was found on Mars it would be considered life but an organism on Earth isn't? Why is it illegal to break an Eagle's egg, but not illegal to kill a baby?

these same people who won't eat eggs because it's ""a baby chicken"" or who won't even eat dairy products because of ""animal cruelty"" but they're 100% comfortable killing something because it's ""inconvenient"". that's hitlerian eugenics

homeless people are inconvenienct too. they're smelly. should we go around killing them too?

also it's extremely sexist considering about half of women WANT abortion to be illegal

despite the divisiveness of the left (trying to make this like it's men vs women) there's a whole lot of pro life women

or do their voices not count (kind of like how anti-dmocrat black people's voices don't count to the racist left?)..

most of these women are less qualified to make laws on abortions than the men who are doing it

If a woman insists on murdering her unborn baby, then I guess it's up to the men to make those laws. 

just like if a murderer wants to murder then it's up to everyone else to make laws against it

""hey u guys can't tell me not to murder!! you've never murdered!""

we don't defer to rapists to make laws on rape

we don't defer to murderers and tell anyone else they can't make laws on murder

OF COURSE entitled Karen's who have abortions are going to be pro abortion

that doesn't mean that only they can make laws on it..

it should actually mean that they have a conflict of interest and should be the ones who ARENT allowed to make laws on it

non partisan third parties without a dog in the fight (and who actually study the issue) should be making the laws. not some karen who can't even name the parts of a fetus loll",1645720106.0

"Guess what, all the suffering we see today comes down to lack of Masculinity and Morality.",Conservative,11,syxidh,conservatives,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/syxidh/guess_what_all_the_suffering_we_see_today_comes/,1,"Of course Putin is gonna attack Ukraine. All the western world leaders are a bunch of pussies who can't make up their mind, because they have too much to lose: ""what if my approval drops? What if energy prices go up? What if I get voted out in the next election?"" And overall, ""what if I lose my affluence and comfort?"" 

So their hands are tied and they can't fight back, even though all it takes is some temporary setback and a few cold nights to stop the Russians. If Churchill had worried about his own career in politics, if King George VI had worried about his throne, if the commoners had worried about losing their peaceful lifestyle, the UK would have joined Mussolini's ""peace talk"" and surrendered to Hitler. Of course, after the war, Churchill was voted out of office, and King George died of Lung Cancer due to the stress of the war. But hey, if they hadn't fought the war, they would probably have been better off personally. There's always sacrifice to take to do the right thing.

And it's not just the politicians, there are a bunch of pussies today among the western citizens too, whose number 1 priority is their affluence, comfort, and good vibes: ""I can't sleep at night because of the honks! I can't drive my Lamborghini cuz the roads are blocked! My beautiful city is full of rednecks I can't stand the bad vibes! Oh and I can't vote for Trump, he's too rude to everyone! And the coral reefs are going away cuz of CO2 and my poor little fishies! They're so cuuuute!""

So Putin, who's not a pussy and still a real man, seizes the opportunity and gets what he wants. Heck, if he didn't seize this opportunity, he himself would be a pussy too!

Masculinity is the backbone of the society. Fighting crime, disciplining children, building career, it all needs masculinity. And you don't have to be a man to possess masculinity. The mother who drags her kid to the police to turn himself in is beautifully masculine. It's all about taking responsibility, accountability, and doing what's right even if it's against our feelings. But no! All we care today is love, comfort, security, and good vibes. God forbids when we discipline our children, because we are afraid that they won't love us! We are afraid of everything, so we comply, we appease, and we hide.

Masculinity is severely missing in today's society. Until we get it back onto every man and woman, no amount of protest or audit or law suits or midterm election will fix anything. 

For those who are afraid of Masculinity because it represents violence, they are right. Masculinity will produce violence without Morality. Is Trudeau masculine? Hell yea, he has the guts to invoke emergency act AND execute it even before it gets passed in Parliament. He showed his power and resolution, but he has no Morality. He doesn't care whether it's right to do this to the peaceful protesters. He knows that the constitution allows him to do it, and that more than half of Canadians support him, so he does it - because he can and there won't be any consequences (in this life, at least). 

Throughout the COVID pandemic, the politicians and scientists together played the entire humanity like rats in a lab. They impose indiscriminate mandates onto everyone because they can - because the law allows them to, and there aren't any consequences. They don't need to take responsibility for people who died from vax side effects or mishandled public health policies. Andrew Cuomo had to resign because of sex scandal, not because his policies killed old New Yorkers. Fauci had never been right about anything, and yet he's still the highest paid public health official. All of us are just suckers, cannon fodder, and lab rats to them, because they have no Morality.

And that's why there are so many lawyers in America. Everyone hires lawyers not to ensure justice, but to avoid or minimize punishment for bad things they did. They don't care about right or wrong - just as long as the law allows it, they will do anything to protect their self-interest.

We often say that freedom, democracy, science, and law are the foundation of western civilization. To this I call bullshit. Without Morality, freedom is nothing but indulgence. Democracy is nothing but tyranny of the majority. Science is nothing but fake numbers to deceive the common people. Law is nothing but a tool to protect the ""right"" to indulge and to oppress the minority. Even religion, something that should be closest to Morality, without it becomes only a way to justify indulgence and evil, and to remove the guilt. After a solemn Sunday service, a church go-er will immediately cheat on his wife the next day, only to confess to a priest later and then do it again.

What we are experiencing today, the rigged election, the botched Afghanistan retreat, the inflation, the empty store shelves, the vaccine mandates, and the Russian invasion, are all signs from God. I'm guessing that God is delivering these onto us because He wanted us to wake up and see that all the things we value today, the freedom, the democracy, the science, and the law - are all a bunch of lies without Morality. And here's the bad news: if it comes from God, nothing and nobody can stop it. Again, no amount of protests, ballot audits, law suits to the Supreme Court, or midterm elections will stop these. And there are more adversities to come until we either wake up, or die out. Your feelings hurt? Sorry. God doesn't care about your feelings, because He only cares for you to be good and act good.

So, what can we the people do right now to fix things? Nothing. We are powerless against God's will. But we can save our own souls (though we can't guarantee that we can save our own lives in this life) by understanding the message, the real reason why things are so bad now. And the first step is to understand why we support Trump: not because his policies can bring us affluence and security or whatever, but because he's on the side of Masculinity and Morality.",1645561848.0

If lebron is a laborer,then it implies that a laborer doesnt have to earn mediocre wages in order to qualify as a laborer. if so, A CEO is a laborer too, if a ceo counts as a laborer then based from the marxian logic,then laborers can be exploiters too.

Serious question for everyone. Are all Protests equal?,Conservative,50,swd8pe,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/swd8pe/serious_question_for_everyone_are_all_protests/,172,"Im truly interested and hope this gets civil debate/discussion 

Are all protests equal?

There is a lot of discussion, argument and anger over the Canadian trucker protests. Many on here are being called “bootlicker” for not supporting the protests and many are trying to compare them to the civil rights marches of Dr King. One person is even said this was a more justified protest than BLM because black people were killed by cops that often (or something along those lines)!

Others are saying they are protesting in bad faith or something very minor and not worthy of shutting down entire areas, businesses, etc. 

I will say I see the people saying this is equal to the civil rights protests are the same people that wanted Colin Kapernick fired for kneeling, Cheering or justifying the teargas,rubber bullets, and police brutality of the BLM protests (not the riots the protests) and supported the bills passed to run over protesters in the streets. 

To be fair I also saw some BLM supporters wanting these guys tear-gassed and shot with rubber bullets. (Be better than them. Point of the hypocrisy don’t engage in it) 

IMHO this was not justified and neither was Chaz. BLM protests were legit as would be these guys driving in on Friday, airing the grievances on Saturday/honking their horns/flying their (non racist) flags and banners and then going home Saturday night. 


Would this type (full blocking of an entire city/border bridge/roadway and causing huge safety issues and loud noises all thorough the night for several days) of behavior/blockades be acceptable for:

Seatbelt mandates?

Mask mandates? 

Dui laws?

Smoking cigarettes/tobacco laws?

Speed limits? 

Children vaccination schedule for going to school?

Nudity laws?

“Now shoes no shirt no service” laws 


Where is the line? Freedom of speech and right to protest are not absolute.

For some context and based on my understanding the main reason for the protests was the mandate that truckers had to be vaccinated and the vaccine mandate was for crossing into the US and wasn’t required if your didn’t cross the US/CA border. 

So even if Canada lifted it the truckers still couldn’t cross the border into the US without being vaccinated or quarantining for 2 weeks. 


This brings in the question of the protests. Do you think anyone should be able to cross international borders without following another countries rules? Shouldn’t a country be able to dictate health status of non citizens entering?

If we give the same weight to all protests would anything move again? If vegans know they could do this without being removed by the government they’d absolutely block highways that transport meat and business that serve it.

How about if huge groups of abortion protesters did this? Gun grabbers? Gun nuts? 

Relevant meme https://i.imgur.com/SyLPzal.jpg


Another point/question, maybe be another tome, does the organizers of the protest matter? One of the main organizers for this protest was a openly and proud racist, white nationalist and borderline neo Nazi. Another was a Christian sharia law, rule the world according to the Bible moron. Another was part of the Canadian political party that wanted to make all the Canadian leaders resign and put their own selected leaders in power, basically a dictatorship.

I support lots of causes but if I got an email

The guy in the video argues that a toothbrush is a personal property and not a private property. This is again,implying like your date with a hot girl is personal but you and her having sex later is free for public consumption. The toothbrush analogy breaks into pieces when he said it is a personal property which implies that it is not owned privately,which extends to the logic that it is free for public consumption so everybody can use it. another way he described private property as some sort of social relation like how an employer owns the fruits of the employees labor. but the fact that the trade that took place with mutual consent between two person,makes it personal. so this implies that personal property is a function of private property. You can set personal discretions beyond the public's involvement because you're a private individual.

This is another model done by socialist i saw online 

https://ibb.co/x7gHGXL

If we express the numberline mathematically

a+b=0, or 1+(-1)=0
where 
A=Private property
B=Public property
0=Personal property

hence, 
0-(+1)=-1(Personal-Private=Public)
0-(-1)=1(Personal-Public=Private)

Those are mathematical expressions that even a one-eyed,left handed quadriplegic kid can understand. that Personal property without private property means=public property. so that toothbrush you own personally is subject to public consumption. also, personal property without public property implies =private property. which means private property= personal property.

"""Primitive Communism"" is nowhere found in nature",Conservative,30,svkec9,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/svkec9/primitive_communism_is_nowhere_found_in_nature/,44,"Not even primitive people qualify as egalitarian in nature. regard Lions in africa. its much easier for a pride than a single or a couple  to take down a buffalo given its size. hence, a collective(hunter gatherer) proves to be optimum choice for that condition. the same case though doesnt apply for smaller preys such as warthogs or impalas that even a female lion could handle with ease. a pride of lions function as an immediate return system due to their inability to store food. so a bigger prey would require more hungry mouth who would benefit for any excess. lions who settle on smaller groups (a couple or three) on the otherhand are optimum for smaller preys so submission to a bigger collective is not necessary condition.


A. Social Factors
(i) Individual trait similarity
Sex - Grouping patterns of male lions may be influenced by their tendency to form coalitions that cooperate to compete with other coalitions for exclusive access to females (Packer & Pusey 1982). Grouping patterns of female lions is believed to be influenced by the need to protect their young and also maintain a long-term territory (Packer, Scheel & Pusey 1990).
Age - Age specific behaviour can also influence grouping patterns in lions. For example, subadult male lions may disperse from their natal pride and form coalitions with other dispersing subadult males (Van Orsdol 1981).
Reproductive state - In lions, lactating mothers tend to temporarily separate from the rest of the pride to forage and nurse their young (Packer et al. 1990).
B. Ecological Factors
(ii) Prey availability
Prey abundance - According to the prey abundance hypothesis, lions would be predicted to prefer areas of higher prey abundance (Hopcraft, Sinclair & Packer 2005), therefore individual lions may aggregate around these areas of high prey abundance
Prey dispersion - A measure of prey dispersion describes the distance lions have to travel to encounter prey or the effort involved in searching for prey. Lions would be expected to aggregate around areas of clustered prey patches, which are easily accessible (Valeix et al. 2010).
Prey herd size - A larger herd of prey might be considered a richer patch insofar as, all else being equal, it provides an opportunity for more than one lion to make a kill (in the Serengeti lions were observed sometimes to kill multiple prey when several lions attacked a herd and each captured an animal (Schaller 1972, page 251)) and also provides a higher chance of the lions finding a vulnerable individual within the herd. Larger preys herds are therefore expected to support larger lions groups.
Prey body size - A large bodied prey also might be considered a rich patch insofar as, for example, a single eland or giraffe could readily feed several lions, whereas a single gazelle could not. Availability of large prey would therefore promote large lions groups and strengthen group ties.
(iii) Interspecific competition
Hyaena to lion ratio - It is suggested that competition with hyaenas may impact the grouping patterns and social structure of lions (Cooper 1991). To avoid detection and encounters with hyaenas, lions may form smaller prides and also hunt smaller prey, so that they are less conspicuous (Périquet, Fritz & Revilla 2015). It is therefore likely that the ratio of hyaenas to lions may have an effect on lion social structure and grouping patterns.

[Lion Group structuring](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03013358/document)


To distill the point down it's essence. Humans like tigers are by no means generally egalitarian. Humans like sub-adult male lions tend to experience ""donor fatigue"" and leave a collective(hunter gatherer/immediate return system) this is not to mention the fact that individual humans can store food(delayed response system) through a credit system(lending food,belongings) to other member of the tribe inexchange of cooperation or a means of preserving value like how modern currency systems work.",1645197482.0

Labor Theory of Value is Groundless Garbage.,Conservative,54,stx31n,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/stx31n/labor_theory_of_value_is_groundless_garbage/,53,"It has no practical utility/applications much less have the quality to predict anything. it presumes that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between labor and value but we know that is utter drivel. demand and supplies have infinite elasticities and we know that through this basic production function  Q = f(K, L, P, H) that Labor(L) is only a small conglomerate of production and much more part of cost which is linear ,and not of productivity which is mostly denominated by capital investments such as land,machines and human capital(specialisation)



Marx invokes LTV to explain price, i:e Diamonds constitutes higher prices, for more labor is exhausted during the production, or colder regions have comparative advantage in crop growth therefore fewer workers are needed for production. Does higher labor cost necessarily mean higher output price?  the opposite is true, that a more valuable labor corresponds to a lower output price. It also shows that marx theory which he parodied from ricardo and smith is groundless vermin of garbage.and that its practice is Marxian nonsense and its result is catastrophic.

assuming  an employer hires labor, L, to produce output, Q, by a production function of Q = ALα , where A is  constant. assuming further that this employer observes a profit
function:
π=pQ-wL
where p=product price, while w =wage rate.
Profit maximisation will derive the following output supply and input demand
function

Q=(αAp/w)^ α/1-α

L= (αAp/w)^ α/1-α


α = wL/pQ

Now, we can disprove Marx labor theory of value (see graph provided)where the y-axis measures price while its x axis one quantity, manifests two supply curves corresponding to α=0.6 and α=0.7 according to the earlier equation i provided  (Q=(αAp/w)^ α/1-α) obviously for the same quantity, the price associated with α=0.7 is lower (or for the same price, the quantity much larger). Hence, the more valuable is the input, the lower the output price.1
This result may look baffling to some pidgeon-brained economists, but there is a good rationale behind it. Marx considers all workers similar, but in reality though,some laborers are much smarter than others. A smarter laborer may ask for a higher compensation, but the resulting output price is surprisingly lower. If instead of a lower price, the alternative result is larger quantity, as also shown in graph i provided,the profit for the firm that hires these workers will be massive. If it is just an individual, a superstar, who makes this change to achieve this increased profit, the firm will pay him/her an astounding wage rate. That is what’s happening in the real life.
To be fair to Marx, an increase of the same kind of workers do raise cost and price, as a movement along a supply curve, but to deduct then a cost-price theory is simple-minded logic. It will be shown next that such logic is not only wrong, but also devastating.

[Graph](https://ibb.co/HLSHtcb)

The supply curve as illustrated in the graph shows a positive correlation between price and output. To increase output, the employer employs more labor. therefore, there seems to be a positive relation between workers and output price. However, the reason that a firm hires more labor is for a higher output price, not vice versa. To think in the vice versa direction is marxian garbage. Unless you are a monopolist, unnecessary hiring or wasteful spending is suicidal, i.e., killing your own company. marx's reasoning is vice versa: first labor then price, and therefore suicidal.
Marx's bad influence has ravaged so many developing countries. Some, seeing others’ successful accomplishments, simply copy their spending ratio, only to result in waste and destitution. some asian nations copies German education spending as a certain percent of GDP, its ministry of education is thus allocated with huge sum of budget, and by the end of every fiscal year it coerces its subordinate universities to begin an absurd spending spree. Those trying to be manage their budget responsibly will be punished for ineffective execution of budget. Such spending is wasteful If the waste requires further resource to maintain, it is absurd.
Such indiscriminate practice is not limited to one ministry, neither to the central level, but
it happens virtually everywhere, including to those (SOE's)state-owned enterprises. Of course, it is not limited to asian nations either. Indeed, even stupidity employing mArx's theory is also groundless garbage, as manifested by many communist regimes. The suicidal consequence is collosal deficit, massive buildip of national debt, consistent inflation and famine


This proves that the more valuable input, or a smarter laborer must diminish,not raise price. alternatively, laborer may increase output to contribute more profit. In contrast, Marx's labor theory of value uses only simplistic logic, which is patently false and injurious.",1645021348.0

Anti-landlord argument is that they just collect rent, and taking advantage of poor renters. Pro-landlord arguments are that they are providing important service and absorbing risk. No one seems to know or discuss the alternatives. Remembering soviet Russia perhaps I can describe the Russian system during socialism/communism.

In Soviet system they tried to allocate housing fairly and since property ownership was illegal, all property was owned by the state and ""rented out"" to the people. However housing is inherintely unequal resource. Some is closer to city center, some is smaller some is larger, some is newer and some is older. The fist thing that soviets did, was build massive apartment complexes. They were gigantic, hideous, cheap to build and every unit was state approved size (maybe  500 sqft  on average).   So, since housing was guaranteed, you were given one ""fairly"" so you did not actually get to choose where you live.


You get assigned an apartment, that information goes into your papers. These papers now determine where you live and you CANNOT physically change it without petitioning the government.  You are likely live there for the rest of your life. At any point the government may decide to give you a new address and you will now live in new address. If you protest you may end up in jail or Siberia since you are considered an anti communist.

At any point the government may decide that 500 sq ft is too large for a family of 4 people, they may move in another family (or 7) without your input.

The city where you live is written into your passport, moving between cities is illegal and is akin to immigrating into a completely different country.

The government is your landlord, so if anything breaks you need to petition the government to fix it. It may take a while. Nothing ever gets repaired or improved.

What is right-wing populism,Conservative,1,srrj4k,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/srrj4k/what_is_rightwing_populism/,64," Please correct my definitions of the left/right divide in politics if you disagree. How I define ""right-wing"" is the veneration of hierarchy as a way of organizing society. As in a pyramid-shaped distribution of power and authority in any given organization. There are a smaller and smaller group of people with ever greater authority to control the ones beneath them.  


Conversely, ""left-wing"" is the veneration of egalitarianism as a way of spreading out authority  to as many people as reasonably possible.  


I think these definitions help explain why some ideologies fall in either camp. A classic example is Marxism vs capitalism (I understand capitalism isn't an ideology but it is often discussed as one).  


As a capitalist, especially if you believe in a form of meritocracy, the people who own or generate capital and money earn their positions of power and influence. It is both a good and an effective way of maintaining society to let people who deserve/earn the power be the stewards of society.  


Conversely, the socialist/Marxist wants to limit the power of capital holders so that the workers, the majority people have the most say in how society is run. I understand this may be a gross oversimplification.  


I only belabor this to explain my viewpoint and why I'm so confused by the prominence of right-wing populism.  


I ask this complete sincerity, Is it possible to have a sense of class consciousness and not be ""left-wing""? Am I confusing class consciousness with populism?   


This is where I show my bias but in the context in American politics, I have often felt that self-described right-wing populists have to settle with culture battles that their ""populace"" want because the right-wing portion of their belief prevents them from critiquing the actual people with power ie the 1 percent (or more accurately 0.5%) Even when they do go after a Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg or George Soros, it's less about their disproportionate wealth and influence and more about the specific agenda. Mind you, this isn't inherently bad and they're well within their rights to do so obviously, However, pardon my bias, it often comes across as surface level. A great example, do people (particularly conservatives) hate/criticize Twitter for essentially having the privileges of a private company while having the power and influence of a utility, or do they get mad at perceived bias against right-leaning Twitter users? I often find that its the latter and personally I think the former would be much more productive.

>Jeremiah the prophet said, ""Lord, I know it's not in man to determine his own course"" (Jeremiah 10:23). In Samuel the prophet's day, Israel had a theocracy, a government not by fallible kings and people but by Perfect and Infallible God Himself. But Israel insisted it wanted to be like the rest of the world of independent, ungodly nations, having a king to lead them to war and to govern all the affairs of their nations. They came to Samuel with this demand. God told Samuel to let them have what they wanted. They were rejecting God's rulership. They wanted to follow someone they could see because they had no faith to follow and obey God Who proved Himself to them in every way feasible.

> So, they got their way and ultimately, it's been tragic ever since. See what Israel has been through in history to this very day, as bad as the rest of the world, even worse. So, the answer to Israel's problem is to return to God's Personal Rule - yes, what we call a ""theocracy"" - no kings but Him, no politicians, no human government, no corrupt, though ""well-meaning"" men making decisions by their own volition and wisdom for the people. 

> The world's problem is the same and the answer is the same as that of Israel's. Until they declare that Jesus Christ is their Lord, the Creator of all things, and determine to embrace His Way and Law of Life,  they'll continue to steal, kill, and destroy one another. They will continue to be in conflict, insecure, fearful, poor, resentful, and lost, without hope. 

> It's our choice who we're going to answer to, God or man. Because we don't believe in what we don't see with our physical eye, we'll choose a ""hero"" every time to lead us everywhere, in everything. And if we don't like the way our leaders are doing things, we may try to grab the reins of power ourselves and make things right, even with good intentions. And we'll end up following the same methods, traditions, and customs, making the same mess our former leaders or heroes made, and on it goes.

> We've now arrived at the Valley of Decision. This is the end of the ages we're in now. Will we choose death, returning to ""the normal,"" or will we choose life? Will we continue to insist on our own way or will we choose to believe God?

""The formula for the rate of profit, (s/v)/(c/v + 1), leads to the result that the rate of profit is higher in those industries where the organic composition of capital is lower, i.e., labour intensive industries. This contradicts the empirically given fact that the rate of profit is constant across all industries. Marx had to explain how this phenomenon of the general rate of profit comes about.""

https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/r/a.htm

Now, i really don't know where to begin because the false premise of the quote is too loaded that it takes an entire economics course for one to understand why its not the case. 

This , (s/v)/(c/v + 1) function from the quote above is fudged to come up with a desired outcome which is based on the ricardian model of value which was later skewed by marx as he sees fit and called it "" labor theory of value""

this function , (s/v)/(c/v + 1) falsely assumes that    variable capital(v) or Labor,is a multiplier(v^2) and commences at the premise that surplus value is denominated by 
labor(s/v)which is again,just the same old ricardian nonsense(LTV)

If we're going to derive , (s/v)/(c/v + 1) 
then
f(x)=scv^2 or f(x)v^2sc
S=Surplus
C=constant capital(investments such as land,machineries,employee training(human capital)
V=Variable Capital(daily labor operation or simply labor)

f(x)=scv^2 to explain this for laymen. it means for every 1 labor,there is 2 surplus value generated or much simpler a 1:2 ratio. at least that's what the marxist page implied and as i said a stupid fudging of the production function to satisfy the Old outdated and false notion of labor theory of value.

We know that Labor is not the source of surplus and labor is compensated by wage not profit.even in industries where labor is intensive such as BPO industries or massage parlors or generally sectors that provide services. we know that inspite these industries are labor intensive, without capital and business investment such as employee training or prime lots for operation. these people are basically unemployed and Capital is willing to incur the risk even confronted by the prospect of uncertainty when it comes to profit.",1644541698.0

Communism is a utopian philosophy turned dystopic. Every iteration of communism in history fails in incredible fashion. However, like Phil Swift slapping Flex Tape on a leaking water tank communist apologists spout ""...but that wasn't *REAL* communism. Communism is stateless.

Well, as a proud capitalist swine, I too am largely unread on communist philosophy. While that comes partly rom my general opposition to ingesting intellectual junk, it's also because each time I start to read a communist manifesto or philosophy it's simply such trash I cannot bring myself to finish it.   


However, to get through to these quasi-scholarly Zoomers of TikTok and Twitter, I am going to painstakingly read and unpack Communist Literature and Manifestos. I will illustrate how it is intellectually disingenuous, academically lazy, and hopefully bring some minds back to reality.  


I fully believe one must go big or go home, so I am starting with the ponderous tome ""*Das Kapital""* or *""Capital""*  by Karl Marx. If you're a communist and wish to serve up another manifest or philosophy, please: send it my way and I'll get to it...I'm not sure when. *Capital* may take a while. 

Here's why I'm at least worth the read, for you skeptics:   
I have a degree in Philosophy, so I can unpack and understand complex and novel thought.   
I have a JD and am licensed to practice law in \[a State\] so I understand how to (1) set aside subjective impressions in favor of an objective interpretation and (2) I know how to thoroughly research where I fall sort.

Is capitalism antinatalist?,Conservative,6,scaw4a,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/scaw4a/is_capitalism_antinatalist/,27,"Antinatalism is a philosophy that assigns a negative value to birth. It contrasts to natalism. Policies can be described as natalist or antinatalist. For example, subsidising childcare is natalist and subsidising contraception is antinatalist. The One Child Policy is antinatalist but the Three Child Policy is natalist.

Some view natalism as important and believe that policies should be implemented to boost fertility rate in order to fix the ""ageing population"" problem. However, others believe that low fertility rate is a good outcome which will help reduce congestion and improve the environment.

What I have noticed is that many countries seem to experience fertility rate decline as they become capitalist and especially when they have been capitalist for a long time (what some may describe as ""late capitalism"").

A good example is China, which although many would describe as a communist country, implemented reforms in the 1970s when Chairman Mao died and was replaced by Deng Xiaoping. The fertility rate then collapsed from about 6 babies per woman under Mao's Agrarian Socialism to about 1.3 babies per woman today after market reforms.

Based on these observations, it is tempting to think that capitalism as an economic or political system is inherently antinatalist.

What we can see from the history of many countries is that capitalism prioritises capital over labour and that capitalism encourages the accumulation of capital. Under Chairman Mao, it was illegal to own capital. However, under Deng Xiaoping, it is legal to own capital such as property, cars, etc.

When you own capital, you gain from other people's labour. So for example, suppose I owned a factory. Then I gain when other people work in my factory. I make profits off other people's hard work.

If I were to have children, that means that I must pay for the child. If I pay money to have a child, that means I have less money left over, which means I accumulate less capital. Therefore, in order to accumulate as much capital as possible, I will not have children or have fewer children. 

Furthermore, the more capital there is, the more work there is to be done. So suppose someone accumulates a lot of money from working and convert it into capital by building factories. They build multiple factories. Because of all these factories, workers now have more jobs. More jobs are created when factories are created. When workers work at these factories, they have less time to have kids. In fact, if someone spends a year looking after a child rather than work at a factory, they lose whatever income they would have earned from working in the factor. Capital accumulation has created a higher opportunity cost for having kids.

Moreover, the more children a worker has, the more he needs to pay for the children, which makes him more dependent on working. A worker who is childfree may be able to retire early in his or her 40s if they work hard and save money and invest in capital. However, if they have children, their retirement is pushed out to e.g. their 60s. 

When a worker has children, not only does he sabotage his early retirement but he also creates another worker (his child) who will be an input into capital in the future. So basically the benefits of procreation go to the capitalists who gain profits and dividends from their factories while the actual costs of raising the children fall on the worker.

To summarise, capitalism encourages accumulation of capital, which reduces fertility because having kids means you accumulate less capital. You have fewer kids or no kids in order to accumulate more capital. Furthermore, when you accumulate more capital, that capital, if labour is an input into that capital, will create higher opportunity costs for workers to have children. Moreover, the more children a worker has, the more dependent he is on capital, so if he wants independence from capital then he needs to have fewer kids or no kids. When a worker has children, the capitalists of the future benefit from having more labour that they can use to create more money for themselves. By holding capital, the labour that future generations provide to that capital can be harnessed for profit, but the costs of raising children falls on workers.

It seems then that capitalism disincentives procreation and incentivises being childfree or having few kids. Is capitalism inherently antinatalist?",1643107463.0

Numbers like that could put us on the path to universal health care, a decarbonized economy, and much more.

n October, Senator Ron Wyden put forward a proposal to tax the unrealized capital gains of the country's billionaires and those with income of at least $100 million for three years in a row. It would generate an estimated $557 billion over 10 years, according to congressional tax scorers.

Welfare Policies Incentivise Racism,Conservative,55,s31yw5,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/s31yw5/welfare_policies_incentivise_racism/,52,"Welfare policies inherently promote racism in a country.   
They cause people inside a country to hate immigrants coming into a country and taking away ""their group's"" resources  
Giving welfare to one group causes other groups to resent that group.  
Austerity causes all groups to blame each other for taking or not sharing enough the country's resources.   
Government regulations like minimum wages cause minorities and immigrants to be locked out of lock-skilled jobs - often intentionally.   
Red lining caused some groups to get government assistence for buying homes while excluding others.  
In the UK, EU citizen's free access to healthcare within the UK was a contributing factor in the UK leaving the EU.  
Welfare policies are often the root cause of racial discrimination between groups and raise racial awareness and segregation.

Beyond capitalism,Conservative,0,rzwvf3,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/rzwvf3/beyond_capitalism/,12,"I'm not sure capitalism is the best thing ever, but it seems to work better for our society today than any known alternative. (I started to write this in reply to another post, but felt it spun into its own post.)

Money is a crude tool. It distills everything down to one number. This can produce weird results. For example you can buy a small business that employs several people for the same price as a small house in the Bay Area. 

Maybe we should have different currencies for shelter or other items? Productive assets compete with dead money. Our over-investment in housing stock, especially at the higher end, lowers our national income. I realize this is a choice made by the purchaser, but certain incentives kick in at the individual level that are at odds with broader society. (Full disclosure - I spend a lot more on shelter than I probably should.)

Many video games, for example, have multiple ""currencies"" which are used in game to allocate different categories of goods. This only works because there can be no black market that allows for arbitrage.

As we approach the singularity and post scarcity for many goods (but few services) capitalism will likely face existential challenges. We should prepare. 

In ""primitive"" societies, ""money"" was used to allocate only certain items that were scarce and used daily. Fish, rice, tools, but things like housing and livestock were allocated based on status. This continues to some effect today to a lesser degree in some modern societies. (A great book that touches on this is ""A History of Money: From Ancient Times to the Present Day,"" by Glyn Davies.)

When people compare CEO pay in the U.S. to other countries (e.g., Japan) or even America in the 1960s, they're missing this element. Becoming a CEO used to be a grooming process and included many perquisites and intangible benefits rather than a straight bidding war. I accept that the transparency and broadened net resulting from the bidding war likely produce greater economic efficiency, but it is a bit cringe when CEOs are making unfathomable sums while others toil for a year to make what the CEO nets in an hour.

How does one value art? Many artists struggle with this. I think a lot of them would rather see the piece go to a ""good home"" ... where somebody they like appreciates it, than net top dollar. And don't even get me started on how puppies are sold! Seems so odd ... I wouldn't sell my six year old mutt for a million dollars, but you can buy a puppy for $500.

I watch movies and television shows set in the future, and most gloss over the role of money (think your Star Trek series, etc.). The movie ""In Time"" was not a great movie, but a great exploration of an alternative currency.

As technology advances and blockchain becomes more ubiquitous, money might be divided into different use categories that embed different tax rates or scarcity based on societal values. This would obviously be a restriction on freedom in some sense. While I value freedom above almost everything, we have responsibilities to society (hedonism has its limits) and our current system is very lumpy and destined to get lumpier as we approach post-scarcity for many goods.",1641749960.0

It has even been called ""the wretched science"". Why? Because unlike real scientists, economists cannot run controlled experiments. We cannot just build two countries or even cities, give them identical starting conditions, make their economic policies identical except for one, and then write down our observations six weeks later. And for a while, it seemed like this would always be the case.

But lo and behold, the 21st century has offered a solution: video games! Minecraft, specifically. It is now easy to create multiple identical virtual worlds; fine-tune their rules without politicians getting in the way; populate them with test subjects for whom sickness, poverty, and death have no real-world consequences; and watch them like little virtual human ant farms!

So, here's the setup.

Server 1: ""Ancapistan"". The only way money enters circulation is by people digging gold out of the ground and converting it into coins. There are no taxes, and land belongs to the first person who gets there, but your claim is only as good as your ability to defend it with a sword because PvP is ON!

Server 2: ""Georgetown"" (named after Henry George). Fiat currency enters circulation in the form of a UBI. Where does the UBI come from? I don't know, maybe the ghost of Milton Friedman drops it out of a helicopter. Land claims work on a land tax system, and there may be other ""money sinks"" (in-game mechanisms that players can spend money on, which is then removed from existence) in order to control inflation. PvP is off, because this is a magical land where making things illegal prevents them from happening.

For added hilarity, the two servers can have different names for their currencies. One could be named the ""NORFED liberty dollar"", and the other could be the ""hundred trillion Zimbabwe dollars"", because that's a thing that you can do with server plugins.

The two servers would otherwise have identical maps and rules.

Each server will be tasked with building a [giant golden cock and balls](https://youtu.be/4wgQvij3rVE?t=214) in the middle of the map. After an arbitrary period of time, Worldedit would be used to determine the number of gold blocks used in the construction of each. Whoever has the biggest dick will be declared the winner.  

Obviously, this wouldn't actually prove who's right *in the real world*, but it would be a fun experiment, probably generate a lot of hilarious news stories (due to the [victory condition](https://youtu.be/4wgQvij3rVE?t=258)), and maybe even get serious economic papers written about it.

The options approach asks, “What freedom does a starving man have?” The answer is that starvation is a tragic human condition – perhaps more tragic than loss of freedom. That does not prevent these from being two different things. No matter what ranking may be given to such disagreeable things as indebtedness and constipation, a laxative will not get you out of debt and a pay raise will not insure “regularity.” Conversely on a list of desirable things, gold may rank higher than peanut butter, but you cannot spread gold on a sandwich and eat it for nourishment.

* **Voluntary** exchange of goods and services
* Freedom of association
* Incentives for the owners of capital to maximize the value of their capital

Since trade under capitalism is supposed to be voluntary, workers have every right not to render their services to a buyer who isn't offering them the wage they want. Much like how Joe the contractor isn't obligated to work for you if you can't agree on a quote, individual workers don't have to work for Kellogs or McDonalds if the company is offering a shit salary. That's why I don't understand it when rightists cry about strikes. If the people selling their labour aren't satisfied with the price they're being offered, they have every right not to work. Kind of like how a grocer isn't obligated to sell to a customer if the customer isn't willing to pay what the grocer is charging. 

Workers also have freedom of association. This means they can band together to collectively bargain, pool their funds, and represent their interests. Any policy restricting collective bargaining is inherently illiberal and tyrannical.  

Workers own a very important form of capital: their own labour. Ideally, the guy selling you the service should have a say in terms of how much the service will cost. Working people can and should try to maximize the exchange value of their labour. After all, that's what capitalism is all about! Capitalism is about people operating in their rational self interest, and it's in the rational self-interests of workers to negotiate for higher wages. 

Growing labour unrest and the rise of r/antiwork is happening because workers are tired of being underpaid, underinsured, overworked, and treated cruelly by their bosses. I have no problem with workers banding together to demand fairer conditions, health/dental insurance and livable wages.",1638988371.0

Arguing in Favor of Universal Healthcare 

Edit: So apparantly some people think this I'm in favor of Universal Healthcare.
Below are arguments I have heard from advocates for it.
-

1. Universal Healthcare would cover everyone regardless of wealth
2. Universal Healthcare has been adopted in almost every other advanced nation. (Wether that's relevant or not... )
3. Universal Healthcare would relieve all people in medical expense debt allowing them to spend more.
(Some people who debated with me admitted:
Potentially more expensive
Less Capacity
Potentially less quality healthcare",1638602497.0

A story of a former Socialist state,Conservative,86,r7ma5v,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/r7ma5v/a_story_of_a_former_socialist_state/,25,"Hey Evrybody. I come to you here from Egypt. Egypt as you may have known is a former socialist state. Our story starts with King Farouq, a king of Egypt under the protection of the British in 1950 - ish. Farouq was a very lazy and vulgar king. He was a meh one in that he want cruel or murdurous but he reveled in drinking, parties and women. But his age was kinda a start for a good capitalist economy manifested in ome of the largest Ford factory in the world and I think the only one in Africa and Middle East. Other prominent businesses were booming and multiple ethnicities and nationalities stormed to Egypt to get their fair share of wealth from working different jobs and such. But there was a problem, the life of an Egyptian Peasant was somewhat of a hell. They were uneducated, they worked for nothing for the land owners and they had a miserable life. All this changed when a charismatic group of army officers decided ro surround the king palace with the army and demanded he cedes the kingdom at once which he did giving birth to the Arab Republic of Egypt. 

Arab Repiblic of Egypt was ruled by the leader of the revolution Mohamed Naguib which wanted to establish a good government and abolish the Army council that ruled the Republic and that led to him being overthrown by our hero "" or our villain imo "" mohamed Gamal Abd el Nasser. 

Our Glorious president Nasser was the son of a dirt poor peasant who lived the hard life and saw how the rich were controlling the poor so when the very moment presented itself he turned the ARE into a socialist state with the help of the USSR. He went out to ""redistribute the wealth "" he ""stole "" for lack of a better word every private owned asset in Egypt and turned it into the public sector. That included factories, stores, savings, lands, apartment buildings and anything he could get. He took the personal belongings  of the kings family consisting of jewelery, palaces, cars and lands. He didnt differintiate between Egyptian owned or foreigner owned. He didnt take into account whether you deserved your stuff due to your hard work or due to abuse of peasants. One example is a prominent singer/composer who built his way up from poverty and made the 1st ME and Africa factory to make vinyl records and sound recordings. When Nasser took the country he took the guys company and annointed a trusted officer as the leader with our singer hero as a manager in his own company with a salary of 1 tenth what he made before because it was deemd too much for a human to make. Our singer hero was so heartbroken he died a couple months later.

So now that Nasser had literally everything in the country he started the ""redistribution"". Ofc the officers who helped him with the revolition got the lions share. They were given palaces, jewellery, companies, lands and ""Wives"" of royalty. He then proceeded to give evry peasant a 5 فدان I dont know the english word sorry but it is kinda a lot. Doing that he created a caste of land owners that really did nothinh with it except use it build apartments and houses and then do as little as possible with the rest because as you know farming is now controlled by the state and that meant little to no money as the price is indocated by the state leading to one of the worst disasters to ever befell Egypt. The country who once fed Europe now has lost 70 or 80 percent of its agricultural lands and the rest were nearly barren.

He wrnt to create a public sector of lazy and useless government emplouees who did no work and still got paid because you know thats their ""right"".

He used the factories to employ the same guys who got ""profits"" from the factories even when the factory was a net loss. This invitrd some genious workers to literally burn the factories to grt out of work knowkng that they will get wages and profits even when there is no work is done.

I can go on and on about the police state and the destriction of private businesses. Btw he was also the one who drove the Jews out of their homes because theu wdre ""greedy"" and hoarded money. Putting them in a situation of life or death leading them to rin into Israel who he antagonised in every oppurtunity he got. 

He got Egypt into many wars to help ojr comrades on the middle east and made a propaganda machine so stupid it would make Orwell seem like an optimist. 

He made a social security program that rewarded the lazy and the people who had many children. Near every family in the country had 6 or more children with some of them reaching 20 children. It was even made fun of in a movie of that period. The program gave free housing, free food, free healthcare, free education even universities and a guaranteed job for every memeber in the country. It sounds like a socialist wet dream. 

Oh I can go on and on and on about this guy but I am sure now you got the gist. If you want more I would be happy to do that in another post.

Long story short he got Egypt into goddamn hole and his presidency ended in a disaster. The Egypt- Israel war of 1967 which ended in the near annihilation of Egyptian Armed forces and the taking of Sinai by Israel at which point he wanted to cede the presidency but the people went to the streets chanting his name and he had to accpet to continue leading the country a couple more years till his death.

Long story short, his economic model got worse every passing year for about 70 years till the presidency of our new ""still military sadly bit at least better than his precedents"" president Abdel Fattah el Sisi who took it up onto himself to change the economy giving way to more ""capitalist"" economy by grtting rid of some social programs and investing much more into the infra structure, tourism, private businesses, foreign investments and less into the public sector of lazy unproductive workers. They guy still catered for the extremely poor by removing their slums and relocating them to middle class apartment building and new cities with mich better amenities and oppurtunities. He created a new healthcare system this time with a more controlled environment and workers. He revolutionised education by introducing new systems, e-learning and new exams that rewards the innovative thinking.
Every single report coming from all sources of valid economic studies say that Egypt has done many things right and we r now the 2nd highest economy in Afroca by GDP. Economic magazines and reports indicate we r going the right way and advancing well. We r becoming an energy hub, a property hub and a military equipment hub. 

Many improvements have happened even to the little man so much that even poor villages now have clean water, a good sewer system, hoapitals, schools and goddamn Fiber optics Internet. 

What dies the common man say now ? Well I imagined they would be happy but no. Most people resent him. They say he is fighting religion and God. They say that the good days are gone. That nothing is free anymore. That the youth dont have jobs and apartmnets waiting for them so they cant marry. They say that the new education sucks because it is ""too hard"" they say that the country is making the rich richer and the poor poorer. Multiple left winged movements are calling for revolurions to remove the sictator and restore our glorious socialist state and economy. People have grown so dependant on government that now when they have to stand on their own legs and walk they want to just lay down. I am too tired of this shit.

I know It is a long wall of text and I apologise but I would be happy to hear your thoughts on the matter and to have further discussions if you want.


TLDR. Socialist state for 70 years - Economy shit and near bankruptcy - people grew lazy and dependant - Revolution - new president - more capitalist approach and recovering economy - people whining and threatening violence - leftist want a new revolution to restore the glorious socialist state and economy - too tires of this shit and too tired of people.",1638493355.0

Handouts for the billionaires with our taxes.....,Conservative,40,qu4n3t,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qu4n3t/handouts_for_the_billionaires_with_our_taxes/,22,"            “Without taxpayer support, however, neither Tesla nor SpaceX would have survived this long, and investors never would have had the 
              chance to make massive bets on both companies.”

That allowed the company to show profits sooner than it would have without the credits, lifting the value of the stock. In fact it wasn't until the second quarter this year that Tesla reported more in net income than it got from regulatory credit sales. ""It was really US taxpayers that helped get him through his roughest time,"" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares — today. In 2019, he was still skeptical as the company struggled. ""If it didn't have regulatory credits, Tesla would not be the brand it is around the globe, and Musk wouldn't be the richest person in the world,"" Ives said.

Tesla buyers received total federal tax credits worth an estimated $3.4 billion before the perk disappeared entirely at the end of 2019. Even if that only allowed Tesla to raise prices by half that amount, that's another $1.7 billion in federal help, on top of the $5 billion it has received— so far — from regulatory credit sales.

And then there's SpaceX, which is a smaller but still significant source of Musk's wealth. The taxpayer support for this venture is even more clear, since it comes in the form of direct government contracts that are worth billions. According to Sam.gov, the government database that tracks federal spending, Space X has signed contracts worth nearly $10 billion. None was more crucial than the one the company received just before Christmas in 2008, when Space X and Musk were both virtually out of cash.

“They were right on the edge of insolvency,"" Dreier said. ""Elon has pointed out at that moment they were on the edge and that helped to save the company."" Dreier said the ISS and other contracts have worked out well for NASA, too, allowing the agency to use SpaceX rather than relying on the Russians to transport US astronauts. SpaceX has since gotten numerous additional government contracts from NASA, the military and other US government agencies. It won a $3 billion contract to develop the next vehicle to carry astronauts to the surface of the moon. And Dreier said SpaceX and other NASA contractors also benefit from the agency's in-kind support, including access to NASA employees and expertise.”

She's the breadwinner of the family and makes very good money, so if she were to lose her job, I would be completely screwed. I'm a full-time engineering student who doesn't have a job.

Do you guys think that layoffs are unethical unless they're necessary for the company to avoid bankruptcy?

I don't think it's fair that a person who's done everything right, played by the rules, and shows loyalty to the company deserves to have their livelihood and the livelihoods of their dependents destroyed because some suit in a boardroom decided to rEoRgAnIzE. If the alternative is bankruptcy, then I might understand. However, if the goal is superficial or profit-minded, I can't see the justification.

EDIT: This is more about the consequences of layoffs for the population at large, and not my specific situation. My mother will likely get a beefed-up severance package due to her considerable seniority and stature in the company, we own a home with no rent or mortgage due, and I would be able to work part-time.

When learning logic, teachers warn repeatedly that once you learn how to spot bad logic you'll see it everywhere. 

That's a huge understatement in USA. 

It's much more to the point to warn logic students that they live in a society of child-like adults, and once you get one stage above conventional in logical reasoning, you'll never look at the concept of 'adults' in the same way ever again. 

It much more to reality to understand there are no adult in neoliberal USA.  

-------

&nbsp; 

Left activism is the worst example of an entire section of society run completely by adolescent mentality. 

Every issue, every identity, every subculture, every left publication, every respected academic and every part within the entire entity is run like a high-school glee-club. 

That didn't work to secure any justice for the working-class...but Leftist seem to have had fun the whole time. That's American adults. Anything they do to have fun is wonderful. That's the child-like attitude of all US adults, and left activism is not only included in that, but the most significant example of the societal problem. 

A metaphor for these words is pissing in the wind, because I think any leftist cares about progress. Leftist only care about making sure everyone knows they are good people since they make sure to stay angry about things they have no idea how to handle. Leftist only seek respect for their anger, and ideas are not needed. Just a 40 year virtue signaling narrative. 

The good leftists didn't do shit for the suffering working-class.

-------

&nbsp; 

It took about 30 years to figure-out that leftist were full of shit and didn't believe in peace or justice but do believe in being angry and yelling. 

Leftists haven't accomplished anything but regression in 30 years, but every 17 old leftist believes themselves to be a political mastermind. 

All the left is now is juvenile mayhem. It's a fantasy world now. 

Their activism hasn't worked and keeps getting more and more irrelevant, but no leftist will move an inch from their folk-mysticism that passes for 'justice activism'. 

-------

&nbsp; 

I understand because I watched the evolution for decades myself. 

Americans want hedonism like Stage 1 of moral development. Americans want to stay children, and are insulted if you ask them to think of explain their thought processes. 

Left activism is front and center in the mix. 

Activism wants hedonism and opportunism, yet still asks for justice. 

It did that for 50 years. Morality was poo-pooed as silly, and still is. 

#Doesn't believe morality exists ---- still asks people to be moral

Leftist activism has no new ideas, doesn't accept any sort of thinking that is not what they've done for 50 years, and so has nothing but stagnation, regression and irrelevance in its future. 

Leftist already have and have given the people all the justice they're ever going to see. 


-------

&nbsp; 

The left can't mature because it doesn't want-to. Every one under neoliberalism demands to stay children for life, and leftist don't want to be left out of the American dream. 

It's boring to watch the thing screaming and only digging itself into a deeper. 

There's not a difference between Left activism and the morals of the ruling-class. Both tell you justice is not possible, but the psychotic leftists scream that it is possible at the same time. 

That's all you'll for your entire lifetime. You have decades of watching that dysfunctional and fraudulent justice movement.

How will health care work in a Anarcho Capitalist society?,Conservative,2,84nd6v,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/84nd6v/how_will_health_care_work_in_a_anarcho_capitalist/,3,"Here's my question, by the way this is my first post in Reddit as a whole I believe.

How will health care work, given the inflation on the free market due to write-offs from the hospital? Hospitals everyday take in whoever they see sick in their emergency rooms. It is my understanding that if you are having a heart attack, they will treat you first, and ask about your insurance later. 

So, when a person comes in who is having a heart attack, has no insurance, and no job, he gets treated for his heart attack and lives to tell about it. He leaves the hospital with a $100,000 bill that he never intends on paying, and the hospital eventually realizes this. They write it off, because they know they can try to send him to collections, but more than likely, that money will never be seen.

How do you have a free market, where this sort of thing is bound to happen. The hospitals inevitably shift the loss of profit to insurance holding patients, thus rising the cost of medical care overall. How do we fix this problem? ",1521128191.0

Need moral advice from AnCap perspective re: a friend's land deal,Conservative,7,60gom3,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/60gom3/need_moral_advice_from_ancap_perspective_re_a/,60,"A friend and i had a falling out over how he handled a land deal that turned sour and I want to know if you all think I did the right thing.

Both of us have been AnCaps since high school though I haven't always been into the philosophy of it as much as he is. He left town after high school and basically got rich in Silicon Valley doing db administration.

The trouble started last year when my friend bought some land in town he wanted to build a summer home on. The previous owner had a house on it that burned down and he stopped paying taxes on it (or something like that. I don't know the details) so it got repossessed by the city. My friend bought it from the city and started drawing up plans to build on it. I was going to help oversee the project while he was away (since I live right down the block and used to do construction work).

A couple months after he bought it we were surveying the property and we found a squatter. He had built a little lean to and had planted some potatoes and corn. We told him he had to leave but the squatter wouldn't budge. Things got pretty heated and my friend basically threatened to call the cops if the guy didn't leave by the time they started work tearing down the old foundation.

Threatening government force doesn't sit right with me although I guess if we're forced to pay for it we might as well use it when we're in the right. But anyways, I decided to try to reason with the squatter a couple days later. I explained the situation to him and why my friend had a right to the land but the squatter wasn't having it. The squatter says the government had no right to take the land from the previous owner and that my friend basically paid for stolen goods so he doesn't have a rightful claim. The squatter says he's got a better claim than anyone since he homesteaded it after it was abandoned by the previous owner. He wants my friend to buy the property off him.

My friend was upset that I even suggested buying off the squatter. He says the squatter knew he was breaking the law when he started squatting so he deserves what's coming to him and that since he owns the land the squatter is violating the non aggression principle. I'm not so sure about that because I don't see why it's my friend's property at all. Really, you could say we're violating the squatters rights by threatening to send jack booted thugs against him. 

Long story short, I told my friend I wouldn't help oversee the project unless he bought the land off the squatter fair and square. Now he's not talking to me and I assume he's going to send jackbooted government thugs over there soon. Did I do the right thing?",1490018868.0
"ELI5: How can privately held wealth not lead to strong, centralized power?",Conservative,5,5yhdae,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/5yhdae/eli5_how_can_privately_held_wealth_not_lead_to/,7,"Coming here since I consider myself a left-libertarian and y'all have different views that I'd like to expose myself to.

I view history as a series of civilizations with increased levels of centralized power: tribes -> duchies- > nation states. I see these forming from claims to land, protected by private armies, which are made possible only through the wealth of a person/group of people who fund the armies. Resources extracted from the claimed land further empower the central authority, be it a chieftain, a royal family, or a federal government. Wealth equates to power, as greater wealth allows one to acquire more goods and services. 

Capital begets capital, something we see happening today and something that was apparent in Pinochet's Chile, arguably the most free-market-friendly government of the 20th century. And it's undeniable that the wealthiest Americans exercise enormous power over our political system by financing campaigns. In an ancap society, what are the checks on the power that capital gives? What is to stop the wealthiest from hiring their own private armies and staking territorial claims? Were prehistoric societies not ancap societies, which ultimately led to increasingly large centralized authorities?

FROM THE MAKER OF 'STATISM: THE MOST DANGEROUS RELIGION',Conservative,7,3sgxun,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/3sgxun/from_the_maker_of_statism_the_most_dangerous/,0,"As a follow up/sequel (of sorts) to 'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6uVV2Dcqt0), I am currently working on a documentary length (60-90 minutes long) production with a working title of 'Voluntaryism: An Idea Whose Time Has Come' (although I am also considering the title 'Liberty Rising: The Philosophy of Anarcho-Capitalism'.

The film will be aimed at people who are either completely new to the philosophy of voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism, or who are half way to becoming voluntaryists/anarcho-capitalists (i.e. current minarchists), and it will guide the viewer through the philosophical groundwork of voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism, from the non-aggression principle, self ownership and the philosophical basis for property rights, to the fundamental economics and benefits of the free market (from an Austrian School perspective), the coercive nature of statism (and taxation), debunking all the most common philosophical justifications for the alleged legitimacy of the state (social contract theory, democratic consensus arguments, utilitarian/consequentialist arguments, et cetera) and, finally, it will address anarcho-capitalist alternatives to the ""services"" currently provided in a coercive, monopolistic, extortionate manner by the state.

The film will be made available for free on YouTube, although I am also planning to release it on DVD (at low cost), which people will be free to copy and distribute as much as they like to friends, family and total strangers.

I will be using plenty of narrated excerpts from both 'For a New Liberty' and 'The Ethics of Liberty' by Murray Rothbard, and I am hoping to also feature relevant snippets from talks/interviews by the likes of Stefan Molyneux, Tom Woods, Walter Block, Mike Huemer, Larken Rose, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, David Friedman, Robert Murphy, Lew Rockwell and others (providing I can get permission from all those people, and the relevant copyright owners). 

The whole video montage will be compiled in such a way that each segment flows coherently into the next, and all of it will be ""glued"" together with narration written by myself but actually voiced by a paid narrator (I hate the sound of my own voice).

I have already been working on this project for over a year now, and I have made a lot of headway, but due to work constraints, I have been unable to work on it anywhere near as much as I would like (ideally I'd be working on it full time), and there's still a fair amount of work to do. In a desperate bid to finally get this project finished and released, I am reluctantly asking for assistance.

The film features an abundance of nifty motion graphics, animation and stock footage (all designed or paid for by myself, except for any free/public domain stock footage I've been able to find) to help visually illustrate the points made in the video. As anybody involved in motion graphic design or animation will know, these endeavours can be extremely time consuming. If anybody reading this is skilled in graphic design, motion graphic design, animation, narration, or any other relevant areas, and is interested in helping with the project, please get in touch at 'johnnada80@googlemail.com'. I will obviously credit anybody who helps in any way in the closing titles.

In addition to assistance with the technical side of things, in the coming weeks I will be starting a kickstarter campaign, accompanied by a trailer to give people an idea of the production quality, style and content of the film. Basically, in order to finish the film, I need funding, to pay for things like stock footage (which really isn't cheap), a narrator, studio headphones/monitors, a computer capable of rendering complicated, high definition motion graphics (without taking two days!), a decent studio microphone and a website to promote the film (including website development, web hosting and domain name).

I would never usually ask for funding. I worked on 'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' for three months straight, pretty much full time, with many sleepless nights and 48 hour editing marathons, but that is only 12 minutes long, and the new film will be 4-6 times longer than that, so I'm going to need help if this thing is going to get finished anytime soon!

'Statism: The Most Dangerous Religion' has now been translated into over 12 languages (the last time I checked), and has already had over 300,000 views (including the translated versions and reuploads). In my humble opinion, the new film is significantly better, more persuasive and aesthetically pleasing, so it has the potential to blow my previous effort out of the water and really make a huge impact in getting the ideas of liberty (specifically voluntaryism/anarcho-capitalism) spread around the world!

Well that's the end of my rant/begging. Watch this space for the trailer which will be released in the coming weeks/months, and please consider helping out with the kickstarter campaign which I will be starting soon!

If anybody would like to contribute via Bitcoin prior to the release of the trailer/kickstarter campaign, the address is: 1JfweLVprPCnUmRKpqC9uK7NZbZjt9XazW

Former an-cap and I've some questions relating to my misgivings on privatised legal systems. So where am I wrong, in your opinion? Also I'm slightly dyslexic, apologies.

The system of the plaintiffs choice could entail any punishment, for the most minor of infractions... Would companies that made use of prison labour, not profit most from life sentences, for the most minor of crimes? Could they not pay the courts for prisoners or even run the courts themselves? Would this not create a massive incentive for false imprisonment and lengthy sentences for the most minor of infractions? Also false accusations to such systems to win compensation.

What are the prisoners rights? If the private legal system determines it, it could be anything, even nothing. It's deliberately crazy but imagine if prisoners were sold as a sex slaves? Why does the accuser have to use a system? Cant he tie the accused up in his basement, who's stopping him? If people are... What extra right is it that private legal systems have to judge and detain people that he doesn't?

I mean I do like aspects of Robert Murphy's suggestions on prisons in a free society, I think there may be a place for things like he suggests. But really struggle with the idea of unlimited choice in law. Defence is justified but beyond that when the assailant is detained it's not longer defence.  To me it aught be the pursuit of justice, but with choice it's whatever the accuser and court wants to get out of it, namely a guilty verdict and profit... Aside from that revenge, financial gain, sadistic pleasure anything.

We have law and order and due process, innocent until proven guilty, not to protect the guilty but to *try* to protect the innocent. When choice enters the equation what prevents the accuser from subjecting the accused, to a system who's trail they are incapable of winning...
