Capitalism vs. Free-Market: At what point are they different?,Conservative,6,9vyx3d,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/9vyx3d/capitalism_vs_freemarket_at_what_point_are_they/,2,"I usually think of the two as interchangeable, but most staunch commies are hellbent on capitalism and free-market/free-trade not being the same thing. So my question would be at what point are the two different? 

I think the problem is communists tend to take the word ""capitalism"" and give it the definition of either ""corporate capitalism"" or ""crony capitalism."" They will never look at just capitalism because, let's be real here, most of their arguments would just fall flat, since [by definition, capitalism doesn't require a state.](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+capitalsm&oq=define+capitalsm&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

I doubt communists even know the difference. They basically just use ""capitalism"" for ""thing I don't like"" and ""free-market"" for ""thing I'm okay with because communism can't work alone."" Seriously, I had commies trying to tell me capitalism and trade requires government... on a board about illegal drugs. Black market sure needs government to operate. Not denying that the US hasn't meddled with the black market, but the black market would be there whether or not government was invovled.

Wondering how Libertarians feel about school choice from a different angle than what’s been talked about lately..?,Conservative,5,suouyx,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/suouyx/wondering_how_libertarians_feel_about_school/,241,"So to go along with the title.. I graduated roughly 12 years ago now and I’ll say that in the schools I went to my parents had a lot of choice in MY education. 

Back when I was in school we learned about alot of things that I’ve come to realize aren’t taught in most American schools as freely as it is where I live. We had pretty extensive sexual education that covered anatomy, sexually transmitted disease, intercourse, contraceptives, sexual orientation, gender reassignment… the list probably goes on and on. We learned about the Holocaust and the way Hitler rose to power through nationalism. We learned about things like the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Daughters of the Confederacy, Jim Crow, just general acts of suppression in the US. 

We read books that had  subjects that dealt with sexual assault, murder, racism, genocide, incest, religion, lack of religion, pro religion, anti religion… basically everything people think now should be a parental right to remove from curriculum. 

I learned about social issues that gave me different perspectives than my parents were teaching me. I learned about different things like living with disabilities, living as a homosexual during the Stonewall Era, and other subjects people don’t see fit for school. 

You know what schools did back then? Gave us a sheet to take home that said “Next week we will be dealing with X subject that may cause concern for some parents. Please sign below if you approve of your child seeing this material, if not your child will be placed in a different classroom while this material is given” If your parents didn’t approve you would go to another class where you’d get tutoring help with other subjects, be able to read, sometimes even physical activity would be the replacement like team sports or something. 

Overall this choice kept school informative to so many people and parents were still able to keep their children away from subjects they didn’t believe.


So I’m wondering if this system is unique to my area or if the topic has just shifted to just banning these things altogether vs on a case by case basis?Do you think that school is not only for Math and English but also for teaching kids how society functions good and bad? Thank you for reading and look forward to hearing your perspectives!",1645104626.0
Liberals have no theory of power,Liberal,33,rxvzz6,alltheleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/rxvzz6/liberals_have_no_theory_of_power/,4,"When I talk with American liberals (both the conservative and progressive stripe), I walk away wondering if they have any clue about how the world works outside of their favorite institutions. They seem to have no theory of power -- or at least, their theory of power is limited to very formal structures of capitalist institutions, which blinds them to seeing maneuvers that occurs outside of those institutions.

One common failure is how both wings of liberalism equate conservatism with 'anti-government'. This leads them to making nonsenical claims, including that the people trying to install the [sitting President as dictator are somehow 'anti-government'](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/ivy-league-apologists-january-6-gop-elitism-populsim/621153/) and anti-elite. Wanting a *different* government, does not make you anti-government. Wanting the government to knock heads for capital does not make you anti-government. The Trumpists who worship the idea of police are the most brazen pro-state force in the country. Contrast them with the [anti-authoritarian activists](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/05/1070471256/amateur-sleuths-help-to-identify-hundreds-of-suspected-jan-6-rioters) who work to identify Jan 6 rioters, but provide that information to reporters and activists rather than police.

Similarly, groups of liberals often minimize Trump's dictatorial power-grab by asserting that he didn't *do* anything -- by which they mean that he did not explicitly order anyone to do anything illegal. They ignore how he constantly expressed support for illegal acts such as extrajudicial punishment and even execution by the police, and how he hinted that he would (legally) use his wealth and power to protect those who broke the law in his service. American liberals seem to be so thoroughly indoctrinated with the ideology of liberal capitalism, that they can't see the complex power-plays that have been the essence of power since the [dawn of civilization](https://art19.com/shows/tides-of-history/episodes/511687bb-0049-47a9-8bb0-6f5ec01a1fee).",1641522089.0

Would the size of the US and Canada be a potential issue for sectoral bargaining?,Liberal,9,qw6uv2,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qw6uv2/would_the_size_of_the_us_and_canada_be_a/,9,"**TL;DR Isn't the United States (and Canada) too big, with night-and-day differences between states/provinces in terms of geography, living expenses, etc. for sectoral collective bargaining? If no, why not? If yes, what are some solutions?**

So, there is an objection to tripartite corporatism - especially in ""big"" countries like the US and Canada. I'm a big fan of tripartism, which is what exists in Singapore where they have committees wherein representatives of unions and employers negotiate with government oversight. Examples include the National Wages Council and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. Having these sort of committees on the federal level sounds great.

But a big problem is countries like Singapore and Sweden are... ""Small."" Meanwhile, the United States is huge with drastic differences between states and districts. For example, the cost of living in California is outrageously expensive while extremely low in Louisiana. Thus, workers in these two states will have *conflicting interests, even if they belong to* ***the same sector.*** The workers in California will champion high wages and benefits which reflect how the absurd cost of living. Meanwhile, workers in Louisiana will not only offer more modest proposals, they may consider such high wages a detriment to *their* stability.

Is this a valid criticism of having tripartism in the United States or Canada? What could be a solution to this? One proposal with respect to having a Federal Wages Council would be treating it like OSHA. It would be a federal entity but with *state* councils so workers and employers in each region handle their own affairs. The feds would only intervene in the event the benefits demanded in one state will bring detriment to other states (if not the rest of the country). There'd also be legislation passed to ensure state and local governments cannot ruin everything (like Red states have with welfare programs in the past).",1637177130.0

"Thoughts about the whole Russia/Ukraine sitituation, and how it is being discussed right now",Liberal,1,swk7gb,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/swk7gb/thoughts_about_the_whole_russiaukraine/,4,"One thing I've noticed about the current crisis is how everybody is presenting it like there're only 2 possible ""one side should win"" solutions: aither ""Ukraine is accepted into NATO"" or ""the West just agrees to Putin's demands"". The problem is that's not how the actual diplomacy should work.

Real diplomacy between countries (especially the Nuclear Powers) is done through **bilateral agreements.** If you actually want to preserve peace, you should call for something like ""The West agrees to not accept Ukraine into NATO, in exchange of Russia guaranteeing to never invade and legally limiting the allowed amount of Russian troops on Ukrainian border"" - both sides back down and sign to certain mutual obligations as a compromise.

However, instead the entire discourse presented as ""you should take a side"". And, I think, the reason is that **it was never about wanting peace.** Both sides clearly want to uphold their own imperialism, and so try to paint the situation as ""my imperialism winning is the only good solution"".

Particularly at the Western side, they want Ukraine in NATO, and so have crafted a narrative, in which the only alternative to this option is ""completely backing down to Putin, creating a precedent for further blackmails and making Ukraine even more vulnerable to future invasion"". Any compromise and any bilateral agreements are not considered as an option, and never talked about in the Western media, because the real goal is to get Ukraine into NATO, not to protect in from Russian invasion. Of, course, the same argument works for the Russian side as well.

As Socialists, who actually want peace, this is what we should call for - bilateral agreements between Russia and the West. Maybe, not exactely for the option that I've stated above (at the end, I am not a professional diplomat), but definitely for an agreement that will obligate both sides to certain concessions. Supporting the ""one side should win"" narrative ultimately means promoting imperialism, either Western or Russian.",1645305572.0
A New Years Speech,Liberal,24,ru70f6,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/ru70f6/a_new_years_speech/,7,"Hello friends, comrades and colleagues

&#x200B;

Another year has been handed over to the books of history, another year finished. A year that is seen by a lot of people as a gruesome one, one filled with hate, anguish and sadness - for good reason. But looking back at it may not be the best idea, instead we should understand 2021 as an additional ground stone for our future work.

Because 2022 won't be any easier. We have a lot of divides to heal and work to do. One thing to remind us all of is to not grow stale or too complacent, becoming too comfortable with our current situation. Sure the movement may have had some victories, but that doesn't ring the bell for the great return of Social Democracy as such. Complacency might kill this all - it is on us to stand up and carry the mirror for society. A mirror in which we see ourselves every single day - a mirror we have to hold up so society can see itself once more. 

Our task, that unites us all over the world, was and will never be an easy one. Fear, hate, anguish, spite, sadness are all human feelings and as humans we can only go so far on our own. No one said it would be an easy thing, that life as a Social Democrat wasn't without fear. But fear can if used well be our greatest asset in the struggle for a better world.

Our fight for a better world can't, won't be stopped by anything. We stand up in the morning doing our simple best for the movement and society as such. We don't have to remind ourselves of our goals and aims - we carry them in our hearts and minds. Our fight for Liberty, Justice, Solidarity and Democracy is not only our slogan, but the things we have to live in our daily lives as much as possible. 

With our friends and supporters we are a great movement all over this globe, a movement with different peoples and minds but united in the belief that we can do much more for a better society and world in total.In memory of our forebarers we take up the torch, carrying the light into an unknown darkness, an unknown land - the future. Always reminding ourselves of our duty and the echoing words of Marie Jahoda ""*Es braucht Konzepte, Ideen und einen kritischen Standpunkt*"" (It needs concepts, ideas and a critical standpoint).

&#x200B;

Let us stand up once again for a great idea, for a better future, for Social Democracy, alwas united under the slogan: ""*Der Kampf geht weiter*"" (The fight continues).

Am I a social democrat?,Liberal,21,qm1mts,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qm1mts/am_i_a_social_democrat/,16,"I believe that basic things needed to live (land, healthcare, utility, etc.) should mostly be either nationalised or subsidised.

Corporate power must be combatted with regulation, nationalisation, anti-trust legislation amongst similar measures.

Outsourcing is bad, it not only infringes on national sovereignty but also harms local businesses and workers. It must be combatted through tariffs and subsidising local industry.

Income taxation should be progressive, way less for the poor to pay and way more for the rich to pay. The upper echelons of society have an obligation to help the needy. I also support a national land value tax.

Labour rights should be strongly protected and unions should have a say in how corporations are run.

The war on small businesses must end, they must be subsidised and startups should be funded. Small businesses must be able to compete with big ones.

The means of production must be owned between the workers and employers with state intervention when necessary. 

Economic planning is very bad and evil however the market must be directed to prevent failure.

Large private monopolies must be broken up at all costs.

Regulation on things like labour rights, environment, equal treatment and fair market need to be implemented.

Socialism and capitalism have both failed, there must be an alternative. Socialism is inefficient and capitalism is selfish.

Welfare state good, welfare cuts bad.

Immigration must be controlled so that the nation does not lose too many jobs and we have enough resources to take care of everyone.

The government must be for the people at all costs. Populism is a must, it should be neither class divisiveness nor fake populism.  This will involve caring for the people and nation above all.

Economic inequality must be minimised. 

Democracy is good as the people have a right to govern themselves. The enemies of the people (theocrats, corrupt officials, monarchists, globalists, foreign puppets, separatists, totalitarians etc.) however must be purged to keep democracy efficient and inclusive.

Why women have the right to be distrustful and cautious, and the ideas of female solidarity as well as sisterhood are topics of it.

It is not, as the title might suggest (and unlike misogynist structures) a call for violence, but more so one to question our perspectives.

Prior to the past year or so, I wasn't heavily invested in politics at all, I knew some general points that I stood for or against. I hated (and still hate) Cheeto Mussolini and his cronies. And I believed that paying $800 for a ride in the wee woo wagon was a sign that our healthcare system is as dysfunctional as most reality tv families.

In that time I had developed a crippling addiction to strategy games, specifically Stellaris, a sci-fi grand strategy game with diplomacy and politics (to some extent, its not as complex as say Victoria or other paradox game series) as well as resource management and warfare. I really, and I mean REALLY enjoyed (and still enjoy) the diplomatic and political aspects of the game, limited as they may be.

That flipped some switch in my brain, and when I went to design my idealized version of humanity, I actually did a lot of research into how it would function and what would be needed for it to fit my vision, I even wrote a bit of a backstory and whatnot to add some extra flavor to it.

In my research, I realized that my values MIGHT be lining up with Social Democrat values, but after I finished focusing on the game related stuff, I went back and made sure I was correct in my assumptions. (Social Democracy and Democratic Socialism are 2 very different beasts, it turns out, glad I figured that out first and foremost).

TL,DR: Somehow A science-fiction strategy game kick started my process of figuring out what I stand for and against in politics, and is still driving my interest in how governments function, socio-politics, and ""speculative politics"" (as an aspiring sci-fi writer, I love writing all sorts of tiny details for the factions and empires in my setting.)

Thieves of State

Why Corruption Threatens Global Security

By Sarah Chayes, 2015

Page 122–123

Venality hardly stops at the police in Nigeria.

The first tipping point on the road to acute, systemic corruption, says former Global Fund for Peace president Pauline Baker, who lived there for decades, came in the 1980s. That was when the oil boom began. “There was military rule, meaning no accountability, and then free money from oil.”

Nigeria is a case study in what has come to be called the “resource curse.” Valuable raw materials are discovered in a country lacking robust institutional safeguards, and the “rents” these resources produce rupture any contract between rulers and ruled. Quality of life changes negligibly, or even negatively, for regular people, despite the bonanza. At roughly two and a half million barrels of crude per day, Nigeria is the world’s thirteenth–largest producer and the largest in Africa. (The United States imports some 40 percent of the country’s production.) But Nigerians’ life expectancy, educational achievement, and average income, taken together, is about the same as that of their resource–poor neighbors.

Official oil revenues are split between the federal government on the one hand, and the thirty–six state and more than seven hundred local government executives on the other. This downward distribution of national revenue contrasts with Afghanistan’s system, in which provincial governors receive almost no share of the national budget, but get carte balance to extract resources at their own level however they want.

Not all of Nigeria’s oil revenues make it into the official budget, though. On September 25, 2013, Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi wrote to President Goodluck Jonathan with “serious concerns” about the national oil company’s failure “to repatriate significant proportions of the proceeds of crude oil shipments.” In a carefully documented memo early the next year, Sanusi quantified that failure: over nineteen months, approximately $20 billion unaccounted for. “More than $5b. went for a kerosene subsidy, but there’s no allocation for that,” he charged to me later that year. “There are swaps of crude for refined product, but Nigeria is cheated in the swap.” On February 20, the wisely respected official was sacked.

This leakage of national wealth is typical, attests the MacArthur Foundation’s Kile Shettima. “There are always shortfalls in the federation accounts. It’s a permanent fight between the Finance Ministry and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation – where the real issue is. It’s a big cartel feeding off the backs of the people.”

In the view of a Western official in the capital, Abuja, Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan “has not been as clever as his predecessors. He and his circle have been taking too much oil money before it gets into the budget.” Another high–ranking Western diplomat remarks sardonically that the oil minister, Diezani Alison–Madueke, is “just doing her job – providing Jonathan with money.” An official at a different embassy, who monitors the oil producing south, dubs her “Jonathan’s ATM.”

––––––––

Indeed, such majors as Shell and Italy’s ENI began temporarily shutting down pipelines in 2013, wherever significant siphoning was detected. “The scale of these activities has reached unprecedented levels,” wrote Shell Nigeria chairman Mutiu Sunmonu in a company report, calling the theft “a parallel industry.”

Nigeria does not convert its own crude into consumer products, moreover. The country’s four refineries languish in disrepair. The government imports fuel from abroad and sells it at a subsidized rate – another opportunity for corrupt scams.

Given the unique opening that oil, like other types of mineral wealth, provides for centralizing production and capturing the resulting wealth, it is perhaps unsurprising that other segments of the Nigerian economy have been allowed to wither.

In a country where rains lash much of the territory for half the year and seeds need merely to be scattered to grow – the envy of a parched place like Afghanistan – the diversity and productivity of Nigeria’s agriculture have plummeted since the 1960s. At that time, it was an agricultural exporter; now it imports basic foodstuffs, its overall productivity barely higher than what it was a half century ago. And according to the Nigerian government’s own figures, public investment has been “exceptionally low,” even by African standards. Underinvestment in transportation infrastructure and power generation has also damaged the food industry.

Innovators in a sector that still absorbs most of the country’s manpower crave the least sign of official encouragement. The eyes of a taxi driver are in the capital, Abuja, who had graduated college in agriculture, lit up as he described the business he dreamed of founding: a closed–system farm, where he would produce high–quality meat for Abuja’s upscale hotels and restaurants, by planting soy for oil and feeding the nourishing stalks to the cattle. He had a plan all mapped out but could not obtain a loan at less than a crippling 26 percent interest rate.

When people who are rightfully angry at incels say to them “just get laid” they are reinforcing the same patriarchal ideas which oppress women, by encouraging men to view sexual promiscuity as an important achievement which should be prioritized above all other forms of meaningful self-development and education on sex/gender issues and general consideration toward other people’s perspectives.

Hello my good friends. One of my favorite parts about this sub is the knowledge of history and the legacy of that that the Social Democratic movement carries with it. There are not many places online where a majority understand the difference between Germany and the Nodic Model. However, I also feel that this knowledge has so far been mostly limited to one side of the Atlantic. I have seen people question whether America even has a Social Democratic heritage. 

I seek to change this view. America has a rich history of people at the edges of sociality organizing politically to secure am better life for themselves and their children. These movements may not have been called Socialist and their leaders may have read Dewey instead of Marx, but they developed in parrel to their European counter parts and have laid the foundations for many of America's most enduring social intuitions. 

This is the first in a series of posts in which I will explore the history and standard barriers of the American Social Democratic movement, a movement often referred to as [Modern Liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States) and one of its most important founders was a man named **Al Smith.** 

&#x200B;

[\\""All the Ills of Democracy can be Cured by More Democracy\\""](https://preview.redd.it/kj8xqnjto5f81.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfaf150c3f1aa8e5e21fb341016bc1265c9b9ee0)

**Early Life** 

Born to a poor Irish immigrant family in a small apartment in Lower Manhattan young Al grew up at a time of tremendous change in New York. The Gilded Age brought development to the city that had not been previously imaginable. Smith witnessed all off it in the crowded streets of the fourth ward. Witnessing much of its construction as a child he would later remark that ""The Brooklyn Bridge and I grew up together."" His family, devote Catholics sent him to St. James parochial school but at the age of 13 his father died, and he was forced to drop out in order to feed his family. He worked at the Fulton Fish Market for 7 years, making only $12 a week to provide for his mother and siblings. He never attended high school or college but used his time working to study people and how they interacted. Often, we asked where he had by educated, he quipped ""the stales of the Folton Market."" He became known for his smooth charisma and sharp wit acting in a number of amateur theater productions within his Irish American community and slowly becoming a local leader within his neighborhood.

**Entrance into Politics** 

Smith had been involved in his local community for some time when approached by Charles ""Silent Charlie "" Murphy the leader of the Democratic political machine [Tammany Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall). To make a long story short, Tammany was a highly organized and often corrupt political organization that represented the interests of recent immigrants of lower Manhattan. The controlled virtually all of city government and played a significant role in the state democratic party. Murphy wanted Smith as a candidate for the New York state assembly and Smith seeing an opportunity to represent his community agreed.

He won the election in a land slide and became the majority leader of the Assembly a few years later when the Democrats won a majority in the assembly. He faced his first test when on March 25, 1911, a fire broke out at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. The factor was located in on the top of a ten floor building and the owners had locked the doors to prevent the workers from taking bathroom breaks during their 9-hour days. Having no other way of escape many of the women jumped out of the killed windows and [fell to the pavement](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/TriangleFire_25March1911_BodiesOnSidewalk.jpg) those who did not burned to death or were suffocated by the smoke. The disaster killed 146 people 123 of them women and some as young as 14. 

In response Smith set to work pushing through what at this point were the most extensive labor regulations in the US. He formed an alliance with the traditional enemies of Tammany Hall's political machine the leaders of the Civic reformers who lead the cities good government movement also know ass the ""goo-goos."" With the help of [Robert\_F.\_Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Wagner) and [Frances Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Perkins#Marriage_and_personal_life), who would later go on to be Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, Smith was able to pass a total of 60 different labor reform bills ranging from fire safety regulations to required bathroom access to limits on the number of hours women and children could work. These reforms turned New York into the most progressive state for labor regulations and helped Smith win the trust of many of the cities reform leaders.

**Governor of New York**

In 1918 with the support of both Tammany Hall and the reformers Smith was elected governor of New York. Though he lost in the republican landslide year of 1920 he was ran 25% points ahead of the presidential ticket and only lost due do the presents of the Socialist Party. He was easily elected in 1922 and set about on the most one of the most radical reform agendas ever put forward. 

He radically reformed the state civil service system cutting down on corruption and patronage freeing up tens of millions of dollars for state projects. Next with the help of his aid and [Robert\_Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Moses) and Franklin Delano Roosevelt who smith appointed to manage the upstate parks. He created the first state park system anywhere in the nation. Built to be exactable by road and ferry it was the first park system in the world that was designed explicitly to be assessable to all classes of people and helped shift the concept of parks from a remount nature reserve for the wealthy to a weekend vacation for the masses. They included the first modern highways ever constructed and expansive support filialities allowing thousands of daily visitors. Labor protections were also greatly expanded under his tenure, including pension requirements for factory workers and increased government oversight. 

In six short years Smith had become the nation's leading progressive and a major figure within the democratic party. He was hailed as the future of progressive politics by everyone from 

**Bid for the Precedency** 

Smith's first serious attempt seek the democratic nomination was in 1924. He came into the party convention with the support of the northern progressives and Roosevelt serving as his campaign manager. However, his candidacy was blocked by [William Gibbs McAdoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibbs_McAdoo) the son in law of Woodrow Willson backed by southern and western prohibitionists. Early on in the convention Smith fought hard to add a section to the platform explicitly denouncing the Ku Klux Klan and declare it an ""unamerican organization."" This farther alienated the Southerns and the KKK explicitly through its support behind McAdoo. Many speeches were made over the sixteen days of balloting including the now famous speech by Roosevelt in which he praised Smith as [""the happy warrior of the political battlefield.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_of_the_Happy_Warrior) The convention was at a dead lock and after 103 ballots the convention finally nominated a compromise candidate [John\_W.\_Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Davis) who went on to lose spectacularly. 

His next attempt in 1928 Smith was more prepared. He was able to dominate the convention and was nominated almost immediately. Filled with confidence he set out on a cross country speaking campaign. However, his Catholic faith, Opposition to prohibition and New York accent that sounded foreign to many audiences turned many traditionally democratic voters against him. The KKK mobilized against his candidacy and lite burning crosses within view of the train as he arrived in many towns. [The press speculated on whether he would be loyal to the Pope or the Constatation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Goodcitizennovember1926.jpg). The economy was also very good at the time and voters were relatively satisfied with republican leadership. He was eventually defended for the presidency losing many rural whites while making huge gains in the urban immigrant community. 

Smith had stepped down from the governorship of New York to run for president and had convicted a reluctant Roosevelt to run for that office instead. Roosevelt would win that race and only 4 years latter win the presidency ushering in a new area of progressive reforms modeled on those first tried in New York.

**Legacy** 

Al Smith and the reforms he championed in New York laid the groundwork of the New Deal that would be implemented by Roosevelt. Even though they fall out later in life both men recognized the scale of each other's achievements. A truly working-class candidate Smith would live his whole life in his in the apartment he grew up in never leaving the community that raised him. He was instrumental to creating the New Deal coalition as he was the first candidate to explicitly appeal to the urban working class a demographic that had been previously overlooked. 

He should be remembered today as one of the most important politicians of his era and a man ahead of his time.

But perhaps this point is not so obvious to other people, so I thought it might make a good discussion.  

Suppliers on the black market are clearly trying to support a consumer demand for their product, so there are certainly some market incentives involved.  But as a black market operates illegally under the current regime, this prevents the full range of economic incentives that would exist in an actual free market.  It also prevents legal recourse against black marketeers, both suppliers and consumers.  Criminal activity by black marketeers is thus ""protected"" from legal actions by other black market participants.  Sometimes this leads to reasonable, self-policing, private arbitration efforts, but it also leads to a greater tendency for violent confrontation and retaliation.  

In short, the illegality of the black market exacerbates violent criminal tendencies, thus preventing the full range of economic incentives a free market would provide.

They usually only get that stupid smart alecky type of humour (same as the kids).  
Conversely, being stupid is funny, hence why the funny man is often just a moron.

The funny man gets all the laughs. People tune in to see the funny man. The funny man is typically the main character. So if anything, this dynamic, which is always passed off by MRAs as prejudicial against men is actually just another example of sexism in media (not in individual instances, necessarily, but because a trend can be observed).

We Were Pushed

We never asked for this and tried everything to avoid it. We accepted the lies and legislative shifts to press us further down for decades. All the meta-language of appeasement applauded; every treaty, pact, accord, knowing all the while they were kicking the can down the road. “Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder”-George Washington. 

Obfuscating a truth they were even more aware of than we ourselves could possibly be. 

We weren’t the ones who wrote the predatory laws or refused to take real action toward repairing the devastation, for which they, and generations of their ilk, hold the most responsibility. Our constant pleading going ignored, we began to shout. As they strove with ever-increasing force to muffle and discredit stark reality, louder we roared. Of course, reactionaries in their constant ravings were correct on one account: we were coming to destroy all they stood for. 

Even through their constant discrediting of education and science, so hell-bent on the erasure of any history that doesn't serve their purpose. They knew with their refusal to change and drag us back in time, that we would become the ranks upon which they dashed themselves. 

While increasing the rapidity of collapse focused upon hoarding their wealth and power, the hotter the kiln in which we had been shoved would grow. Our rage intensified at the lack of justice and continued capturing of our processes of political recourse; we found ourselves in a furnace. Our unbreakable resolve worsening their demise. (When you already have little faith and less hope, then what does it really matter?) 

We warned you that those pulling your stings saw you just as disposable as you did all of us. Yet, even as we did, knowing it to be a waste. How could we ever expect you to listen to us when you so often denied our existence but for a target of your division and ??

So, you parroted their lies, cheered as they took our rights, and screeched for violently punitive actions toward our desires for simple human rights. Even when all the insurmountable evidence of the truth to our claims and you, yourselves, suffering under the same grindstone. We attempted in every breath to show you it existed. You called us the enemy and the traitors to morality, while the reptiles you fed constricted the very idea you could trust the beast we had continually said was fiercely rapacious to all but itself. You still blamed us. While your demagogues spewed bile at a revolving cast of victims of the moment, conversely maligning the reality before your eyes. 

You all had been betrayed by all of their deceit nearly as much as we. They denied you the truth; only your bigotry belongs wholly to yourselves. Far as stated by Napoleon I, “There is no class of men so difficult to be managed in a state as those whose intentions are honest, but whose consciences are bewitched.”

Eventually, one thing became very clear to both sides: You stood between ourselves and those who oppressed all of the world. One thing you must keep starkly in mind is they wouldn’t listen, nevertheless, fully knowing what would inevitably occur. They smugly sacrifice you and, with your unified response being further attempts to subjugate us for deeper subservience.

(crosspost /r/changemyview)",Conservative,4,1zzwvr,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/1zzwvr/i_believe_that_the_state_is_necessary_but_not/,25,"I posted the following on [/r/changemyview] (https://pay.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1zxsb8/i_believe_that_the_state_is_necessary_but_not/). I would love to hear the anarchist counter-argument.

My views here are heavily based on *Better Angels of Our Nature*, by Steven Pinker, and the ideas of Thomas Hobbes, as presented by Pinker. I have not read Hobbes directly.

**The Hobbesian Trap**

There are four main motives for violence:

1. Predation - You have something I want. I attack you so I can forcibly take it.

2. Preemptive Strike - ""Do unto others before they do unto you."" If I think there is a chance you will attack me for any reason, then I may gain an advantage if I seize the initiative and attack you first. This can apply even if the reason I think you will attack me is because I think that you think that I will attack you. This, as I understand it, is the Hobbesian Trap.

3. Revenge/Retribution - ""Self help justice"" I think you have done something against me, whether it be a physical attack, or an insult. I attack you in retaliation. This is tied to deterrence (4). If I maintain a reputation for retaliation, then you may be hesitant to attack me. Revenge is exacerbated by the fact that everyone thinks they are more ""in the right"" and their enemies are more ""in the wrong"" than they actually are, leading to escalation.

4. Deterrence - ""The best defense is a good offense."" I attack you to establish my reputation and strength. This can be retaliation (3), or pre-emptive strike (2).

**Leviathan**

The solution to the Hobbesian Trap is ""Leviathan"", also known as the state. It can break the Hobbesian Trap in a few ways:

1. Deterrence - By punishing those who act against the best interests of society it makes crime less attractive. It also takes the burden of deterrence off of individuals, which means that their reputation for strength is less important.

2. Breaking the cycle of revenge - By carefully reviewing the details of a case (the judicial process), Leviathan can get an impartial idea of what happened, so that it can give a proportional sentence. Because retribution is coming from a third party, instead of from the individuals in the dispute, there is less incentive to counter-retribution.

3. De-escalation - If I know that you don't have very much incentive to attack me, them I don't have as much incentive toward peremptive strikes, or toward building up my offensive strength.


**Statistics**

According to Steven Pinker, the statistics back up the Hobbesian view of the state and violence. On average, state societies have less war deaths (per capita and as a percentage of all deaths) and a lower homicide rate than stateless societies. (See *Better Angels of Our Nature*, ch. 2 ""The Pacification Process"", esp. fig 2-2, pg. 49; fig 2-3, pg. 53; and 2-4, pg 55.)

**Caveats**

I am aware that states can and have wrought extreme violence, both on their own citizens and on foreigners. Harassment, brutality, false imprisonment, executions, torture, war and genocide have all come out of states.

Police abuse their power. The judiciary convicts innocent people, not always unintentionally. Laws punish people who are aren't hurting anyone.

But, I believe that, even with those things taken into account, society is, on balance, more peaceful with a state than without.

Workers Vanguard No. 1127 9 February 2018

Their Monuments and Ours

(Letter)

4 January 2018

Dear WV,

In response to the article “Confederate Monuments: Tear ’Em All Down!” (WV 1113) I think it appropriate to note an example of the working class tearing down a monument representing interests antithetical to the workers’ own. The example I had in mind was the destruction of Napoleon’s Victory Column, decreed by the Paris Commune in 1871, while under the guns of both Prussian and Bonapartist armies, as a symbol of national chauvinism and an incitement to national hatred...attitudes unworthy of the Commune in relation to workers of all other countries. [All ellipses by author.]

The Paris Commune, with its establishment of the first Workers’ Republic, had a profound effect on the American bourgeoisie.

This event, among others, led many of America’s Northern bourgeoisie to re-think the wisdom of experiments in remaking southern society and using the Federal army to defend Reconstruction governments and black rights to achieve that end.

Making peace with their Southern bourgeois partners suddenly made a lot more sense, after the Commune, even if it meant abandoning the black population to race-caste status, enforced by systematic violence perpetrated by the forbears of today’s Fascists.

Make no mistake about what the Fascists’ “celebration” of those who fought to keep black people in chains means today.

Auschwitz and Dachau, Belsen and Birkenau, celebrated not in stone but, once again, in reality, is the ultimate monument the Fascists hope to enforce on humanity.

A victorious workers’ state would celebrate its own victory, by contrast, with monuments appropriate to its aim of liberating humanity from the scourge of capitalism and its Fascist dogs of war, by honoring all those who won a crucial initial victory in the still ongoing battle to Finish The Civil War....

One hundred and fifty years ago today’s Fascist forbears were beaten by a black and white army, significantly made up of southerners, ex-slaves, free blacks and the foreign born, receiving critical political support from workers in other countries.

Seventy-five years ago another generation of Fascists were crushed by the might of the Red Army, defending the Soviet degenerated workers’ state.

Today’s Fascists will be defeated by the mobilization of all their intended victims behind the power of the working class, strategically placed in capitalist class society, and the only class with the social power, organization and interest to smash the Fascist threat, here and internationally, as part of its fight to take power in its own name and create an International Soviet.

This program is expressed in the ICL’s call for labor black united front mobilizations to smash the Fascists and its power expressed in a series of successful anti-Fascist mobilizations in the US and one in Rouen, France.

We fully honor the sacrifice of all those who fought against or were victims of Fascist terror only by mobilizing the power to stop the Fascist scum in their tracks, so we do not have to keep adding names like Heather Heyer to the list of the lost and we can, instead, stuff the physical and ideological expression of Fascism down deep in the trash bin of history where it belongs, and where it will stay, with the victory of Socialism internationally over decaying capitalism and the filth it degrades human life with.

Fraternally, Gordon W.

I barely make a net savings every month.

I can't afford insurance of anykind. If my car breaks or I get in an accident I'm fucked.

You want an example of how much this capitalist system has fucked me?? I have had a prescription for new eye glasses sitting on my desk for two months now. I can't afford to get new glasses to even see. There's not room in my budget for that.

How is this system fair? I'm working my ass off and I'm suffering. I can't sleep at night because I'm constantly trying to find ways to earn money. I can't even focus on academics...first semester of college and I had to withdraw from a class. 

At the very least why can't stuff like healthcare be free...that way I'd at least feel a little more protected...and if Im lucky that could probably pay for my glasses too. 

How is this fair? Why do I work so damn hard yet I suffer and struggle to put food on my plate? All I eat is cereal and ramen...

I think I'm actually working myself to death. How the hell do people think this is fair??

Oh... probably by thinking ""you should've worked harder"" or ""well maybe if you invested earlier"" fuck off I've barely started and already I wanna just end it all.

OUTRAGEOUS! Liz Cheney’s Jan. 6 Committee Subpoenaed Phone Records of Mother of Owen Shroyer – Who Works with Alex Jones and WHO NEVER ENTERED US CAPITOL,Conservative,19,t3j7nd,conservatives,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/t3j7nd/outrageous_liz_cheneys_jan_6_committee_subpoenaed/,1,"By Jim Hoft

Published February 28, 2022 at 9:00am

&#x200B;

In August 2021, the FBI issued an arrest warrant for Infowars host Owen Shroyer for being on the Capitol Steps along with around 1,000 other Americans on January 6th.

&#x200B;

This is pure communism — a political attack on a prominent conservative voice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Owen made the announcement during a live broadcast of his show The War Room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The corrupt FBI charged Owen for peacefully standing on the Capitol Steps along with about 1,000 other Americans.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Owen Shroyer was with Alex Jones that day. We sat next to Owen and Alex at the Ellipse during President Trump’s speech. Alex later used a bullhorn to tell Trump supporters NOT to go into the US Capitol.

&#x200B;

On Monday news broke that Liz Cheney’s Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the phone records from Owen’s mother.

&#x200B;

How is this any different than Soviet Russia?

&#x200B;

The Daily Mail reported:

&#x200B;

The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol has subpoenaed the phone records of a mother whose son works for right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones as the panel tries to understand the Infowars host’s role before the riots.

&#x200B;

Court documents filed on Sunday show the committee has subpoenaed records for Annette Shroyer, the mother of Jones employee Owen Shroyer, who was charged with breaching the Capitol Hill grounds during the riots last year.

&#x200B;

Annette Shroyer has accused the panel of abusing its powers and asked a judge to let her join Jones’ pending lawsuit against the committee, reports Politico. Jones sued the House committee in December last year in an effort to block the subpoenas he’d been issued.

&#x200B;

The mother received notice of the subpoena on February 10 and Verizon has indicated it would provide Annette Shroyer’s phone records unless she filed a suit by February 28. The select committee declined to comment.

&#x200B;

The FBI and their Democrat overlords are the modern-day Stasi.

Of course, the worthless GOP is silent on all of this.",1646064958.0

Edward Snowden Betrayed Libertarians,Conservative,0,sr59fp,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sr59fp/edward_snowden_betrayed_libertarians/,35,"Edward stole state secrets and ran. He first landed in Hong Kong (since absorbed by the authoritarians) and then fled to Russia where he remains now.

Snowden, accompanied by Glenn Greenwald et al , working in harmony with Russian intelligence, stole much and subsequently publicized some of the work of intelligence officers in Australia, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Canada, France, and the United States.

A sincere libertarian would have stood his ground and faced all of the people in the public forum to be shown right, free and brave. But Edward wasn't interested in doing the right thing by or for the American people, and he wasn't promoting liberty. It was a theft of state secrets and methods that have since been reproduced and are now being applied by authoritarian regimes in Russia, China and elsewhere on earth with no oversight or accountability.

The technologies developed within democracy, with an expressed commitment to protect and serve all people equally, were lifted by Edward Snowden so he could pass them on to authoritarian gangsters to be used against not only their own people, but the people across the world who live for peace and freedom, the libertarians.

The bottom line is this: the property of the Australian, Dutch, British, German, Swedish, Canadian, French, and American intelligence agencies was taken by Edward Snowden in order to introduce the methods, techniques, and cryptographic technologies to the Russian, Chinese, and other adversarial intelligence agencies, like a new weapon to be utilized and introduced to the equation in those states. The right to privacy of all of the Australian, Dutch, British, German, Swedish, Canadian, French, and American peoples was broken. The property they created with public money, and rightfully own in their digital and physical space, was stolen from them.

The conversation has been and should continue to be had regarding the right to privacy and protections against illegal searches and seizures; it is up to the people's legislatures to serve in oversight and create the right rules, and it is up to the districts to lift up their best each year.

Like any tool, the intelligence systems revealed in the disclosures can be used to build or to destroy, to help or to harm. Edward Snowden lifted these precious tools and showed them to gangsters who use the tools they have to do serious harm.

First, who decides what money is good? I know a lot of AnCaps like BitCoin. Is it consensus that BitCoin will be the global valuta in AnCap utopia? What was the generally accepted idea before crypto-currency came along? Will there also be physical money, and if so, who gets to print it?



Secondly, how does an AnCap society deal with orphans? This can be both children whose parents give them away, or perhaps children of single mothers-to-be who die at birth. Are they supposed to just start working as soon as they leave the womb, is it consensus that kids below X years are taken care of by someone, or what?



Thirdly, (and i know i might reveal my lack of research on this one, bear with me) who maintains the non-agression principle? Do you have other options in case of an attack than utilizing your gun, or your hired mercenaries?

Capitalism and the Enviroment,Liberal,35,rj4qah,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rj4qah/capitalism_and_the_enviroment/,39,"Hi! I am from Norway and I have never voted for the Social Democrats, always went with the Socialist party because I feel they have more empathic attitudes towards people, animals and the enviroment as a whole, while the Social Democrats just wanna keep pumping oil out of the ground.   


As with many people, my votes were usually based more on individual cases though, and not really considering a whole different economical structure than capitalism. I think socialism often means different things to people that are very into politics and people that are not. For instance, it's not so long ago I heard some teenagers talk on the bus that they were voting on the socialistic party because they wanted legalized weed. Doubt they ever considered socialism as something opposed to capitalism, you know. Motives vary. I never really saw myself as a very political person either, and voting for the socialistic party was never really about abolishing capitalism, I guess. In my country we have a multi-party system, so it's not like one party could just change everything anyway.   


Lately though, I've been going down the rabbit hole on climate change and how humanity affects the enviroment worldwide. And for me it's really hard to grasp how we can live in harmony with our planet while sticking to capitalism. I've read about green capitalism and all that shit, but I feel like I really have to stick my head in the sand to believe that capitalism will not mess up the earth beyond repair, no matter how green we prentend it is. Capitalism is a system that demands infinite growth on a planet with limited resources!  Infinte growth, limited resources - How on earth is that gonna work!?   


I've seen som many defenders of capitalism claim that socialism will eventually lead to disaster, but capitalism is already leading to disaster. Hell, it already did! It chops down rain forests and fills the oceans with garbage. I'd love to find an excuse for capitalism, to find info about some kinda regulated eco-friendly capitalism that could actually be sustainable, but it kinda feels like trying to convince myself that Santa Clause is real at this point.   


So I'd like to hear your opinions on capitalism and the enviroment. Is there a way?

Can social democracy solve poverty and inequality? Or is socialism necessary?,Liberal,46,qqa7vw,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qqa7vw/can_social_democracy_solve_poverty_and_inequality/,55,"Obviously I recognize some see SD as a stepping stone for DS. For those individuals, please ignore my question.

Considering social democracy as an end goal, can it truly help ameliorate the conditions of the working class?

I see the fundamental problem with capitalism to be the commodification of labour. All other capitalist atrocities follow from this single premise - the inability of full time workers to secure their basic needs, let alone the unemployed, underemployed, incapacitated or otherwise unable to find not only full time work, but full time work at a living wage. If labour were not a commodity (as it is not in, say, a cooperative), then all workers would be given a living wage **and** be employed.

But it seems to me that capitalist economies - even with strong regulation and high taxes - are incapable of achieving this.

For instance, we can either have full employment or a living wage. Forcing employers to pay a living wage means less labour is demanded (again, labour is a commodity, thus subject to supply and demand), thus some peoplr are out of work. Again, I’m not ignoring the fact that employers may have monopsony power and that a living wage may be achievers run practice, I mean there’s clearly some limit to high high the minimum wage can be before causing unemployment, and *in principle* this means that it may cause unemployment if the living wage were above this threshold. Capitalists don’t care what the cost of living is. Labour is a commodity, remember?

Taxes cause deadweight loss too, so there’s effectively a ceiling to how much we can tax. Meaning a basic income and welfare is so solution either. Just a bandaid, really.

I get that unions could force employers to both pay a living wage *and* not fire their employees by preventing dismissals. But this doesn’t change labour demanded. In addition, unions are predicated on the assumption that management will magically bargain. I get strikes represent worker power, but strikes are often bad for worker and society.

It seems to me that social democracy simply cannot solve the fundamental problem with capitalism, and instead relies on bandaids that amount to not addressing any of the goals social democracy sets out to achieve.",1636483207.0

So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear, that there is no alternative way so far discovered of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by the free-enterprise system.""  Milton Friedman ",1640615873.0

Why is the nationalist right hallucinating a ‘communist enemy’? | Richard Seymour,Liberal,7,s3co5z,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/s3co5z/why_is_the_nationalist_right_hallucinating_a/,5,"[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/communist-enemy-nationalist-right-trump-us-bolsonaro-brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/communist-enemy-nationalist-right-trump-us-bolsonaro-brazil)

""As Paul Hanebrink’s [bracing history](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Specter-Haunting-Europe-Myth-Judeo-Bolshevism/dp/0674047680) of the myth of “Judeo-Bolshevism” demonstrates, 20th-century anti-communism rarely engaged with the reality of communism. It was, instead, driven by racial and nationalist myths. The idea that there was something inherently “Jewish” about communism, that it was a threat to national existence, extended well beyond the fascist right. In 1917, the chief Russia correspondent of the Times blamed the Russian Revolution on the “seething mass of Jewish pauperdom”. Winston Churchill blamed communism on the “International Jew”, who had no loyalty to the nation.

In the US, race theorists such as Lothrop Stoddard regarded Bolshevism as a “traitor at the gate”, subverting racial hierarchies. Woodrow Wilson’s secretary of state, Robert Lansing, fancied that the Russian Revolution proved the veracity of the [Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/24/theprotocolsofzionarecomi). The [Lusk Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusk_Committee) argued that all traditions of socialism were of German-Jewish extraction. Such tropes were commonplace in the battle against civil rights led by White Citizens’ Councils, and the Ku Klux Klan.""

""Why should anti-communism be so amenable to such racist, conspiracist, and apocalyptic thinking? Perhaps because it works in a similar way. In “black-hole anti-communism”, as Joel Kovel dubbed it, everything that is perceived as threatening can be compressed into a single, treasonous, diabolical enemy: just different tentacles of the same communist kraken.""",1642115893.0
"Have you ever read Gabriel Kolko's ""Triumph of Conservatism""? I have a couple questions regarding anti-trust regulation as a result",Liberal,21,qu5tlx,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qu5tlx/have_you_ever_read_gabriel_kolkos_triumph_of/,6,"Hi!

I am a libertarian market socialist, I have been drifting father left over the last couple years (Trump made me a socdem, and some debates online I had over the summer made me a full on market socialist, though still very happy to work with soc dems).

One contention of a lot of progressive and soc dems is that regulated capitalism leads to good results. Unregulated capitalism and no anti-trust leads to major issues of labor exploitation, environmental destruction, etc.

I agree, capitalism has many flaws (I am a socialist after all).

  
However, I recently have been reading up on a lot of anarchist (leftist anarchism specifically, mutualism and whatnot), and I recently came across this author and book.

He is a leftist anti-capitalist historian of America in the Cold War and the Progressive era and I have been meaning to read his book (I just put a hold on it in the library, will read it when I can),

&#x200B;

According to wikipedia, he makes the following points in his book on the history of the progressive era in the United States:

 

>Kolko's thesis 'that businessmen  favored government regulation because they feared competition and  desired to forge a government–business coalition' is one that is echoed  by many observers today.  
— Eric Garris[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-antiwar1-13)  
>  
>Kolko, in particular, broke new ground with his critical history of the [Progressive Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era).  He suggested that free enterprise and competition were vibrant and  expanding during the first two decades of the 20th century; thereafter,  however, ""the corporate elite—the [House of Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Morgan_%26_Co.),  for example—turned to government intervention when it realized in the  waning 19th century that competition was too unruly to guarantee [market share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share).""[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-amcon-19) This behavior is known as [corporatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism), but Kolko dubbed it *political capitalism*, ""the merger of the economic and political structures on behalf of the greater interests of capitalism"".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-20)  Kolko's thesis ""that businessmen favored government regulation because  they feared competition and desired to forge a government–business  coalition"" is one that is echoed by many observers today.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Cha&Lic_2000_65-18)  Former Harvard professor Paul H. Weaver uncovered the same inefficient  and bureaucratic behavior from corporations during his stint at [Ford Motor Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Corporation).[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-21) Free market economist [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard) thought highly of Kolko's work on the history of relations between big business and government.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-22) As one profile, published in [*The American Conservative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative), put it:   
>  
>For Gabriel Kolko, the enemy has always been what sociologist [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber)  called ""political capitalism""—that is, ""the accumulation of private  capital and fortunes via booty connected with politics."" In Kolko's  eyes, ""America's capacity and readiness to intervene virtually anywhere""  pose a grave danger both to the U.S. and the world. Kolko has made it  his mission to study the historical roots of how this propensity for  intervention came to be. He was also one of the first historians to take  on the regulatory state in a serious way. Kolko's landmark work, *The Triumph of Conservatism*, is an attempt to link the Progressive Era policies of [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) to the national-security state left behind in the wake of his cousin [Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt)'s presidency. Kolko's indictment of what he calls ""conservatism"" is not aimed at the [Southern Agrarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Agrarians) of [Richard Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Weaver) or the [Old Right individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Right_(United_States)) of [Albert Jay Nock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Jay_Nock).  In fact, Kolko's thesis—that big government and big business  consistently colluded to regulate small American artisans and farmers  out of existence—has much in common with libertarian and traditionalist  critiques of the corporatist state. The ""national progressivism"" that  Kolko attacks was, in his own words, ""the defense of business against  the democratic ferment that was nascent in the states."" Coming of age in  the '50s and '60s, Kolko saw firsthand the destruction of the  ""permanent things"" as the result of the merging of Washington, D.C. and  Wall Street. A sense of place and rootedness lingers just beneath the  surface of his work.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Hales-5)

&#x200B;

And:

>According to antiwar activist [Eric Garris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Garris),  Kolko first established his reputation as a historian writing about the  ""close connection between the government and big business throughout  the Progressive Era and the Cold War \[...\] but broke new ground with his  analysis of the corporate elite's successful defeat of the free market  by corporatism.""[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-antiwar1-13) Early in his career, beginning with his books *The Triumph of Conservatism* and *Railroads and Regulation*, Kolko used a revisionist approach as a way of analyzing history.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-GaleReference-9) Soon he was considered a leading historian of the [New Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left),[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-14) joining [William Appleman Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Appleman_Williams) and [James Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Weinstein_(author)) in advancing the so-called ""corporate liberalism"" thesis in American historiography.   
>  
>This was a thesis that disputed the ""widely held view that  government regulates business, arguing that, instead, business steers  government"",[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-GaleReference-9)  and Kolko used it to analyze how America's social, economic, and  political life was shaped beginning with the Progressive Era  (1900-1920). But for Kolko, a social policy of ""corporate liberalism""  (or what Kolko preferred to call ""political capitalism"") shaped the  mainstream agenda of all that was to follow afterwards in American  society, from [The New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Deal) (1930s) through to the post-World War II era of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War)  (1947-1962), and onwards. Kolko's argument that public policy was  shaped by ""corporate control of the liberal agenda"" (rather than the  liberal control of the corporate agenda), revised the old Progressive  Era historiography of the ""interests"" *versus* the ""people"", which was now to be reinterpreted as a *collaboration*  of ""interests"" and  ""people."" So too, with this revised version of  recent American history, came the tacit recognition that this fulfilled  the business community's unspoken, but deliberate, aim of stabilizing  competition in the ""free market.""[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-15)   
>  
>This was an idea summarized by journalist and internet columnist Charles Burris when he argued that:  
>  
>Rather  than ""the people"" being behind these ""progressive reforms"", it was the  very elite business interests themselves responsible, in an attempt to  cartelize, centralize and control what was impossible due to the  dynamics of a competitive and decentralized economy.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-16)  
>  
>In retrospect, Kolko summarized this phase of his career when he wrote that:   
>  
>""As I have argued elsewhere,  American ""progressivism"" was a part of a big business effort to attain  protection from the unpredictability of too much competition, \[See my  book *The Triumph of Conservatism: A Reinterpretation of American History, 1900-1916*, New York, 1962\].[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-17)  
>  
>Kolko argued that [big business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_business)  turned to the government for support because of its inefficiency and  inability to prevent the economy veering between boom and bust, which  aroused fears that the concomitant discontent amongst the general public  would lead to the imposition of [popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) constraints upon business. Its embrace of government led to their intertwinement, with business becoming the dominant strand.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Kolko#cite_note-Cha&Lic_2000_65-18)

marx was basically saying that if you know calculus then you're causing alienation because some workers cant do it. or usain bolt alienating fat people who cant compete in olympic sprint.

Just by these examples,you'll realise how deranged marx was.

Capitalism doesn't commodify people. people commodify themselves. if you know anything about the general equillibrium theory. Demand creates its own supply and vice versa. People commence these exchanges to satisfy their demands that coincide or goes commensurately with their supply from the pov of the parties involved.

Marx sought to abolish the division of labour or specialisation in reference to his exploitation theory that concerns surplus. for Marx,specialisation generates surplus and alienates workers from one another by appropriating each individual's niche according to their resoective abilities i:e an engineer who can do modulus of elasticities or structural computations in order to come up with the cheapest yet most durable,less labot intensive materials available in the market that a construction worker couldn't do. this is the case marx wanted to address with the theory of alienation and his solution was to get rid of it. so people can do everything they want irrespective of their innate abilities. in short. a burger flipper can do surgery works or can design 120 storey skyscrapers when jobs are no longer commodities but incentives brought by a post scarcity world where no one have to work for a living. its pure fairy tale that will never occur in reality",1644030854.0

"Sharon Marcus - Fighting Bodies, Fighting Words: A Theory and Politics of Rape Prevention (2002)",Liberal,8,icl8z4,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/icl8z4/sharon_marcus_fighting_bodies_fighting_words_a/,0,"OCR'd text available here: [https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D85B0BSG](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D85B0BSG)

Introduction:

>In this essay I propose that we understand rape as a language and use this insight to imagine women as neither already raped nor inherently rapable. I will argue against the political efficacy of seeing rape as the fixed reality of women's lives, against an identity politics which defines women by our violability, and for a shift of scene from rape and its aftermath to rape situations themselves and to rape prevention. Many current theories of rape present rape as an inevitable material fact of life and assume that a rapist's ability to physically overcome his target is the foundation of rape.  
>  
>Susan Brownmiller represents this view when she states in her influential 1975 book, *Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape*, that ""in terms of human anatomy the possibility of forcible intercourse incontrovertibly exists. This single factor may have been sufficient to have caused the creation of a male ideology of rape. When men discovered that they could rape, they proceeded to do it."" Such a view takes violence as a self-explanatory first cause and endows it with an invulnerable and terrifying facticity which stymies our ability to challenge and demystify rape. To treat rape simply as one of what \[Mary E.\] Hawkesworth calls ""the realities that circumscribe women's lives"" can mean to consider rape as terrifyingly unnameable and unrepresentable, a reality that lies beyond our grasp and which we can only experience as grasping and encircling us. In its efforts to convey the horror and iniquity of rape, such a view often concurs with masculinist culture in its designation of rape as a fate worse than, or tantamount to, death; the apocalyptic tone which it adopts and the metaphysical status which it assigns to rape implies that rape can only be feared or legally repaired, not fought.  
>  
>Feminist antirape literature, activism, and policy development on rape in the United States during the last two decades have increasingly concentrated on police procedures and legal definitions of rape. This focus can produce a sense of futility: rape itself seems to be taken for granted as an occurrence and only postrape events offer possible occasions for intervention. Although feminist drives to change the legal definition of rape, to increase the penalties for rape and to render the terms of a rape trial less prejudicial to the raped woman have publicized rape's seriousness as a crime, an almost exclusive insistence on equitable reparation and vindication in the courts has limited effectiveness for a politics of rape prevention. Quite literally, the rape has already occurred by the time a case comes to court; a verdict of guilty can in no way avert the rape itself, and no one has proven a direct link between increased penalties and convictions for a crime and a decreased incidence of that crime. The notorious racism and sexism of the United States police and legal systems often compromise the feminist goals of a rape trial.

Is Bill Maher right about China? Someone please help me,Liberal,0,swopsa,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/swopsa/is_bill_maher_right_about_china_someone_please/,22," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50vs0cDuWQQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50vs0cDuWQQ)

\*\*Hi, this is a genuine, honest question. Please no hate thank you

\*\*On 99% other topics I am a Leftist so It really hurts my soul that I am agreeing with Fox News. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!

Okay, so just to preface this question, I absolutely hate Bill Maher. He has swung very far to the right and almost every single thing he says is verbal vomit. However, I just watched a recent clip of him criticizing American companies bowing down to the CCP and I feel like he has a point. America has engaged in many drawn out conflicts like the Iraq War, Vietnam War, Korean War, Afghanistan War that have killed millions of people and civilians. We have had our own concentration camps with Japanese Americans during WW2 and most recently concentration camps with Immigrants. We also have incredible income inequality and racism that we need to reckon with.

However, despite everything our country has, China literally deprives many of their citizens basic, human rights. They house 2 million Muslims in concentration camps, kidnap people who flaunt their wealth or talk badly about the CCP, and are currently literally trying to annex Hong Kong and Taiwan. I genuinely don't understand how the current day American Government is anywhere near as bad as China's. America doesn't do nearly as bad things to it's people as the Chinese Government does. I guess you could argue that America houses the most prisoners in the world and they tend to be black, but even then, we at least have a (extremely flawed) justice system that tries and convicts and provides consul to our people. It just boggles my mind that we can sit here and say that America's human rights abuses are even comparable to China's. We LITERALLY fought WW2 over a bunch of Nazi psychos who imprisoned millions of multiple ethnic groups and we are sitting here, in 2022, acting like China isn't doing the same.

We sit here in our extremely flawed country with certain unalienable rights that no matter how shitty our government is, they can never be taken from us. Despite this, thousands of corporations are acting like the huge human rights violations being committed in China are okay. I hate Enes Kanter and Fox News but they actually make a good point with the NBA being complicit in accepting human rights abuses as is. Its so crazy to me that they virtue signal all this stuff about BLM and then turn their backs on Muslims. Its just very sad I don't know anymore.

Does anyone have an opinion on this? Is there something I am missing? On 99% other topics I am a Leftist so It really hurts my soul that I am agreeing with Fox News. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!",1645318680.0

Boric and the Rising Tide: Social Democracy for the 21st Century,Liberal,144,rpd4t2,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rpd4t2/boric_and_the_rising_tide_social_democracy_for/,35,"It’s been a good year for the center-left. The conservatives have been kicked out in the US, the German SPD has reversed its decline and once again returned to power, as has the Norwegian Labour Party. The Portuguese Socialist Party is well on its way to winning a landslide re-election victory (against the confusingly named Social Democratic Party), and in the UK and Australia, the Labor Parties are shaping up to deliver defeats to the conservatives. 

But that’s not what I want to talk about. What I want to talk about is how social democrats can not only win power but keep winning it. To do this, I believe that we must look to Gabriel Boric’s campaign in Chile and what it can tell us about the future of social democracy, the youth movement and the ways we will need to change - and remain the same.

First and foremost, Boric calls himself a socialist. I believe that to modernize and move forward, social democrats must recognize that those to our left are, for the most part, not our enemies. For much of its history, this movement has been predicated on presenting itself as a third way between the excesses of capitalist oligarchy and the sham socialism of Marxism-Leninism. To put it simply, this is an absurd framing for the modern era. The triumph of neoliberal capitalism in the late 20th century has been so total as to eliminate Marxism-Leninism from the face of the earth, with the possible exception of Cuba. Whatever can be said about the ills of the left-wing populists, they are far closer to our own values than most anyone else. As such, I believe that to overcome the decline of the traditional centre-left, we must return to the big-tent coalition between progressive liberals, social democrats and democratic socialists that delivered the Nordic welfare state and the postwar economic miracle of Germany, brought democracy to Spain and Portugal and delivered the greatest sustained period of prosperity in American history under the New Deal. To put it simply, we need to stop fighting the last war and unapologetically embrace the democratic socialist heritage of Bernstein, Liebknecht and Crosland from which our movement emerged, and accept the diversity of opinion in what must ultimately be a broad front of democratic progressive movements (though we must be careful not to allow anti-democratic “leftists” such as Marxist-Leninists and especially Maoists into our ranks)  to restore the promise of the postwar consensus. While Germany and Norway provide evidence for this theory, nothing shows it better than Chile, where though the traditional center-left’s vote collapsed, their endorsement of Boric proved crucial in his victory over Kast in the second round. Though we are centre-left, left we remain, and we would be fools not to recognize that.

Furthermore, I believe that to have a real chance at moving past the failed neoliberal experiment and back towards a more human-centered, solidaristic economy, we must make every effort to engage with young people the world over, and accordingly adapt our ways of thinking. Social democracy has long been focused on traditional forms of worker organization through the trade unions. While undoubtedly, unions remain a critical part of the progressive movement, we must recognize that in the modern post-industrial West, the economy is now so diverse and so decentralized that it is effectively impossible to mobilize for economic and social progress through traditional labor groups alone. Thus, I believe that the future of social democracy lies with the youth and student movement. We can see this once again in Chile. The wave of protests that broke out in 2019 and ultimately led to the movement that brought Boric to power were led by youth and student groups, and Boric himself is a former student leader. The importance of this can hardly be overstated - the fact that a man just 35 years old has been elected the leader of a country with such an established political leadership group on the back of a student uprising shows how critical reversing the decline of youth engagement in politics will be in reinvigorating the social democratic movement. While Boric’s campaign was obviously focused on issues specific to Chile, I think that the general themes of his campaign - real action to address the economic insecurity that young people fear in today’s gig-focused economy and enforce a real living wage for all - are the most important aspects of the traditional social democratic programme to focus on in our campaigns. That is to say, we need not modify the programme of our movement itself, simply reframe and reinforce it to focus on the real issues facing young people today. Only then will we see real youth engagement return to politics. We can see this in action in Chile, and I believe that we can see the dangers of failing to address these issues in the decline of the traditional center-left and the rise of the Green parties and the populists. 

Overall, I think that moving forward, social democracy needs to focus on the real needs and desires of young people and the electorate of the future by implementing what could reasonably be called the “Boric playbook” - focusing on the ways in which a return to the post-war corporatist model represents the radical break from neoliberalism that so many people express a yearning for, and proudly embracing our heritage within the socialist tradition as part of a project to unite the democratic left and achieve lasting victory for social democracy.",1640574529.0

Thoughts on reclaiming “hormonal?”,Liberal,16,h0engq,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/h0engq/thoughts_on_reclaiming_hormonal/,5,"When I was pregnant, I had a family member dismiss a lot of my feelings with “you’re just hormonal.” Post-pregnancy, I was talking to two family members that I’ve had relationship problems with for about a year and a half. I have been trying to get us all talking about what’s going on so that we can resolve things. They came out with “we couldn’t talk with you when you were pregnant, because you were so hormonal.” 

So, I’m pretty offended, but it got me thinking: how would they feel if when they wanted to talk to me I said, “I’m feeling too hormonal to talk to you right now.” It would be legitimate, because their lashing out at me has been the cause of my only experiences with post-partum depression.

What do you think? Is it giving them the win? Admitting that we have hormones and they affect us? (I cried at sad movies, fed my elderly cat by hand when he was being picky, and adopted a pair of rabbits a friend couldn’t keep. And I was still very capable of maintaining human relationships and conversations)

So what if “hormonal” wasn’t something that other people used on us to shut us down, but something we used on them to shut them down? The mature part of me says that no one should be shut down, but I also want “oh, you’re just being hormonal” to go die in a fire.",1591807529.0

The efforts to reform the committee at the convention were voted down, and it seems like people don't really want to confront the implications of the whole affair. I think this sort of goes hand-in-hand with one of my other major issues with the organization and that's the fact that there are a number of Stalinists, Maoists, and other authoritarian socialists organizing within it.

Killer Capitalist Sentenced to Country Club - 2010 West Virginia Mine Disaster,Liberal,1,4niaqy,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4niaqy/killer_capitalist_sentenced_to_country_club_2010/,0,"On May 12, some six years after a fiery explosion at Upper Big Branch (UBB) mine in West Virginia snuffed out the lives of 29 miners, former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship walked into prison to serve a one-year sentence for conspiracy to willfully violate mine safety standards. Blankenship was acquitted of securities fraud and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could have carried a sentence of 30 years. To the bosses and their courts, lying to Wall St. is a far greater crime than causing the death of nearly 30 miners. In fact, Blankenship will be spending his time at a “Club Fed”—a privately run minimum security facility in California that boasts an unfenced, campus-like environment with a sports complex and a music department.

The 5 April 2010 disaster at UBB was capitalist industrial murder. In the month preceding it, the mine logged 50 safety violations, many related to ventilation. Of those who died that day, 71 percent had signs of incurable black lung disease. Three separate investigations afterward concluded that the deadly combination of methane gas and highly combustible coal dust was the cause of the explosion. Survivors reported that workers who tried to get dangerous conditions addressed were ignored, threatened or told to tamper with the monitoring equipment. A union safety committee could have stopped work at UBB. But there was no union at UBB.

For coal operators like Massey Energy, accumulating violations and fines is just part of the cost of doing business—and cheaper than installing necessary ventilation and safety equipment. Every cited violation is challenged, and until it is settled, the company pays nothing while the government’s limp Mine Safety and Health Administration investigates. This agency does not exist to protect workers but to lull them into believing that government agencies can be relied on to defend their interests. As Blankenship’s sentence demonstrates, the capitalist government, including its courts and agencies, exists to defend the interests of the bosses against working people.

UBB was Massey Energy’s premier money-making mine, and Blankenship made it his personal business to keep out the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). In face-to-face meetings he bullied workers and threatened to close the mine; the UMWA was defeated three times, despite the fact that 70 percent of the workers had signed union cards.

Blankenship is a notorious overlord in a notoriously brutal industry. As a district manager in the 1980s, he was an architect of a vicious, union-busting strategy to push the UMWA into bargaining separately with each subsidiary; isolated strikes were then defeated with a combination of state troopers and bought-and-paid-for judges as well as armies of mercenaries, attack dogs and scabs. Entire mining communities were put under siege during months-long strikes. While he was CEO of Massey Energy, 52 miners were killed.

The UMWA bureaucracy, both under the leadership of current AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka and today under Cecil Roberts, did not respond to these attacks with the historic weapons of the union: solid picket lines and the strategy of “one out all out” until an industry-wide settlement is reached. Instead, they pursued the losing scheme of selective strikes, individual acts of civil disobedience and lawsuits. At the same time, the UMWA leadership did not defend union militants singled out by the government for victimization.

In 1987, the UMWA tops deserted four Kentucky miners, including Donnie Thornsbury, a local president, who were framed up for the shooting death of a scab. They received sentences of 35 to 45 years, and Thornsbury remained in prison until 2010. Likewise, in 1993, Jerry Dale Lowe, a safety committeeman from Logan County, West Virginia, was abandoned to face eleven years without possibility of parole for “interfering with interstate commerce.” Contrast these vindictive sentences to the slap on the wrist given to Blankenship!

The grieving families of the 29 UBB miners, along with those of the 23 other victims killed in Massey mines under Blankenship’s control, will not see justice in the capitalist courts. Something approaching justice for Blankenship could only come from a workers tribunal. What’s desperately needed is the forging of a new, class-struggle leadership in the union, which must be part of a fight to build a revolutionary workers party that can lead the assault on this bloodthirsty capitalist system.

What Capitalism Is,Conservative,9,s1lqgo,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/s1lqgo/what_capitalism_is/,47,"I grow so tired of having to go over this time and time again. All of the anti-capitalists/socialists/communists out there who keep trying to push these absurd definitions of capitalism.

The people who proclaim themselves to be and who utilize the system are the only ones who can define it. There isn't a single self-proclaiming capitalist anywhere - and I can assure you of this - who believes that capitalism is basically any of the things that self-proclaiming socialists or communists think it to be. The second you think that capitalism is slavery or theft, you're not talking about capitalism, you're talking about illegal and immoral actions that some people get away with because we ALL live in authoritarian societies with overreaching governments enacting varying degrees of tyranny upon free peoples.

That isn't capitalism.

So what IS capitalism? This is by far the best definition from my perspective:

>Capitalism is the state in which property owners hold exclusive authority over their property.

But this definition requires defining of terms. Specifically, property, and through proxy of *property*, *ownership*.

*Property* simply refers to any *thing* of which a human being might have ***a will to own***. *Thing* here is simply a placeholder term - a variable. Literally anything can be a thing. A thing can even be an abstract idea.

Ownership can only actually be one thing, else it actually is a non-thing. Ownership is a logical order of operations stretched across time. Ownership has two primary attributes required in its manifestation.

1. A human being must have *a will to own* a *thing*.
2. There cannot already be *a will to own* made manifest from another human being in regards to that *thing*.

1 is required because if it does not exist then nobody even wants to own it. A will to own is a synonym phrasing to simply declare that someone desires exclusive authority over that something.

2 is required because if 2 does not exist then there is already an owner. You cannot own something that is already owned because any attempts to obtain exclusive authority over something already owned unless the current owner consents (wills it) to it is theft, and you cannot own something stolen, nor can you steal what you already own.

So say you are the only human being on the planet and you manifest a will to own something. You now own it. You own it because you have exclusive authority over it and because both 1 and 2 have been manifest. There is literally no contest to your ownership, it simply is, as a default.

Now if you bring that thing back to other people and I notice it and suddenly I also manifest a will to own that same thing, I cannot also own it without your permission because any action on my part in which I attempt to circumvent your will to own is my attempt at theft. I cannot own something I've stolen.

The notion of owning what you've stolen is patently absurd. If you can own what you've stolen then theft doesn't exist, and if theft doesn't exist then neither does ownership. Ownership - like all ideas - must have an attribute of which manifests the idea as a ""something"". Ownership must provide exclusive authority else it provides nothing. If I have $10 and you can take it from me and use it without my consent then my ""owning"" that $10 gave me nothing. If you took that $10 from me and I went to others and told them what happened and nobody knew who to give the $10 to then ownership has no meaning.

Now yes, you can have exclusive authority over something you've stolen, but that doesn't make you the owner, it merely makes you the robber. One primary purpose of ownership is that other people would understand that as the owner, any other people who attempt to rob owners should be punished and forced to give back what they've stolen. Ownership MUST MEAN what I'm outlining otherwise it would be impossible to do this. Literally laws protecting people from the machinations of others could not exist without this logic.

So going back around to the beginning here, capitalism is the state in which property owners hold exclusive authority over their property. This means that everything from theft to murder, enslavement, rape, fraud, and so much more are ALL anti-capitalist. NO society exists in a completely capitalistic system, because ALL systems are partly capitalistic, partly socialistic, etc.

Socialism/communism, in contrast, can ONLY be one of two potentialities: Either it is a potential state of capitalism, or it is the opposing state of capitalism: The state in which property owners do NOT hold exclusive authority over their property.

You cannot argue that ownership is anything other than what I've espoused. Literally ANY other definition is arbitrary and will break down logically as real-life examples are brought to bare. A single human being cannot simply ""declare"" what ownership is, because that renders the definition of the very idea itself as utterly arbitrary. That's AUTHORITARIANISM.

I am actually not making up the definition of ownership, I am scrutinizing LOGIC to UNDERSTAND what it MUST mean in order for it to exist within the confines of a series of objective premises, such as that no human being desires the circumvention of their own will, and that it is not objectively possible to rank-order subjective value structures so as to quantify who's values are greater/lesser.

**TLDR:** **No** capitalist thinks capitalism is anything other than a system in which people own their property and aren't having it taken from them.",1641930501.0

Unsound money (inflationary fiat currency) whets the state's appetite for total war.,Conservative,6,qkoamq,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qkoamq/unsound_money_inflationary_fiat_currency_whets/,10,">government having access to a printing press allows it to continue fighting until it completely destroys the value of its currency, and not just until it runs out of money.

(From The Bitcoin Standard)

All the European countries resorted to unsound currency to finance World War I, an event of unprecedented destruction that accomplished almost nothing except setting the stage for World War II.  Far from being a ""barbarous relic,"" (as Lord Keynes described it) the gold standard was a necessary constraint on the state.  

&#x200B;

>With sound money, the government's war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect.  With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create before the currency is destroyed.

That destruction of the currency can include hyperinflation, a phenomenon unique to government money backed by nothing.

Single Payer Health Insurance in the US would unleash a wave of subsequent programs that would improve everyone's lives.,Liberal,13,qsubdf,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qsubdf/single_payer_health_insurance_in_the_us_would/,10,"America's healthcare system isn't the only aspect of national health that is broken. Affordable healthy food is also very hard to come by, especially when it's surrounded by many more unhealthy alternatives.

Getting single payer health insurance passed into law would unleash a chain reaction of self-reinforcing cycles of self-interest that would upend this entire cesspool of a system.

Implementing single payer health insurance makes the government directly invested in protecting their citizens' health and encouraging healthy lifestyles. The need to reduce costs while fulfilling their mandate will easily overcome the influence of the food industry. This would translate into actually healthy dietary recommendations, crackdowns on the use of blatantly unhealthy ingredients in mass-marketed food, subsidies for fresh produce, healthier school lunches, and regulations on sugary products. The end result is a much healthier and productive populace.

Does this sub sympathize with workers and their frustrations with the current system?,Conservative,21,sybx9r,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sybx9r/does_this_sub_sympathize_with_workers_and_their/,64,"Over the past two years, I've become a lot more sympathetic to working-class people than I ever was before. I grew up in a pretty sheltered upper-middle-class environment where I never wanted for anything, so it's really disheartening to hear how workers suffer on a daily basis. Issues like excessive working hours for very little pay, bad benefits, union-busting, poor treatment, being forced to work while a tornado destroys your warehouse and kills the workers, pissing in bottles, and other stories have made me kind of angry and a lot more sympathetic to poor workers. 

When you guys hear about workers' struggles, do you...feel for them? Like, at all? Do you agree that poor working conditions, excessive hours, and poverty wages are issues that need to be fixed? Your solutions may be different than the centre-left solutions of labour regulations and welfare, but do you believe that America's work culture and treatment of lower-level employees is flawed right now? 

I've always had this conception of libertarians as a bunch of sheltered and inconsiderate rich people and business owners who don't really care about the suffering of workers or poor people and just want to create an environment that favours the profits of the wealthy and big business over the dignity and well-being of the working masses.  

Personally, I completely understand why people are angry. Many workers can't afford food, shelter and medicine due to a lack of livable wages. People are being crushed by student loan debt and medical debt. Some people have to work two or three jobs just to make ends meet. During the pandemic, some 11 million Americans were behind on their rent and faced eviction, and it's literally [impossible for anyone working a minimum wage job to afford rent anywhere in the United States](https://reports.nlihc.org/oor). Some of the most important and essential workers, like janitors, waitresses, labourers, and others are paid really sickeningly low wages. People are fed up, and I don't find it hard to sympathize with them. There is a reason why huge swaths of people are becoming attracted to democratic socialism and anti-capitalism in the United States. When a system fails to provide for people or allow for them to provide for themselves and lead happy and dignified lives, they're going to become dissatisfied with the system. 

This stuff makes me mad. Hearing about people suffering makes me mad. Hearing about full-time workers not making enough to live, let alone afford things like health insurance or a  college degree, makes me mad. I want to live in a society that prioritizes well-being. 

For me, the ultimate measure of a society's success and the success of it's policies is human well-being. The more people with stable housing, living wages, healthcare, enough food, and the ability to go to college without going bankrupt, the better society will be. 

I'm not saying that we should start a socialist revolution and collectivize all of our workplaces, but I really do get pissed off when I hear about the struggles of workers and I understand why people are unhappy. I get pissed off when I learn that people work hard yet are still in poverty in the richest country in the world. 

I've heard from a lot of libertarians that the workers being paid poverty wages are being paid what they deserve and that it's on them to ""just get a better job"". But the world doesn't work that way. It's not as simple as ""just leave"". Generally, when people are working shitty jobs with poverty pay and bad working conditions, they would leave if they had another option. Do you seriously think that people would work such jobs if ""just leaving"" was that simple? Of course not! People stay in shitty jobs *because* they feel trapped in them. First of all, poor people can't just quit and spend months browsing Indeed for another job. They will starve or get evicted. 

Also, I don't believe that wages depend on the value produced by the worker and that said value is objective. Basically, libertarians tell people who work 70 hours a week for 7 bucks an hour that their wage is exactly equivalent to how much they produce, so it's what they deserve. I don't get this at all. Wages are just the exchange rate of a service. It depends on what the *employer is willing to pay you.* They are not objective, they are subjective. For example, McDonalds workers in Denmark get paid more than 20 dollars per hour due to a system of bargaining between unions and employers, and McDonald's prices in Denmark are not inflated. This makes me question the notion that poverty-paid workers are just less deserving of a living wage because they're not valuable enough to warrant that living wage. Are Danish McDonald's workers 2.8x more valuable and productive than American fast food workers? If they're both as valuable and as productive, then why is there such a massive pay difference? Workers know the value of their labour and know what they require, so in a fair system, they get to freely negotiate the alienation rate with their employer.

I've also heard it argued that minimum wage jobs were never ""meant "" to be breadwinner jobs and that they're for high school and college students working part time. First of all, per the data I cited earlier, single people can't even survive on their own working these jobs. This is also a red herring, since many underpaid jobs are not typical minimum wage jobs (construction, janitor, etc.). Second, the on-the-ground economic realities of the working class have nothing to do with your idealized principles of what certain jobs are ""meant"" for. The economy has played out such that many people *do* rely on jobs that you consider too menial to deserve a wage that pays for rent, groceries and healthcare. Also, what do you think happens when high school students and college students are at school or studying? In no way are these jobs exclusively for part-time high school and college students. These jobs are essential and commonplae, so these companies are absolutely propped up by full-time workers in these positions. 

The other thing that I find frustrating about libertarians is their attitude towards college and equality of opportunity. It goes like this:

Worker: I'm poor and work two jobs and can barely make rent each month

Libertarian: Maybe you should have gotten a better job

Worker: This is the only work I could get 

Libertarian: Maybe you should have gone to college and gotten skills that worth a middle class salary

Worker: I was born into a poor family, and we couldn't afford to send me to college. I'm barely making any money, so I can't afford it anyway.

Libertarian: Be born rich next time. 

It honestly seems like the United States is just becoming a place where being born rich is the ticket to prosperity, and where being born poor is a curse. It's not a meritocratic society where everyone has equal opportunities to succeed. Not even close. 

Sorry for the rant, but I just want to know whether libertarians sympathize with working-class problems like inequality of opportunity, poverty wages, and worker abuse.",1645497136.0

I'm not an expert in financial markets, so I'll try to make a bit more concrete here what I'm getting at. Denmark made news recently for saying it would end public investment in [fossil fuels](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/denmark-bans-public-investments-in-foreign-fossil-fuel-projects#:~:text=Denmark%20will%20ban%20from%20next,in%20a%20statement%20on%20Wednesday), as did the [Netherlands](https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-united-nations-netherlands-greenpeace-45f4a39e838667d032d2483956f01c9b) with respect to its pension fund.

Who are the leader decision makers in patient care in your country?,Liberal,10,qv8bg5,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qv8bg5/who_are_the_leader_decision_makers_in_patient/,0,"I know this may seem like a silly question, but I’m curious if it is common in any other healthcare system, and if not, take this as a warning for why private healthcare and neoliberal pushed in healthcare are pernicious. 

I know this answer seems simple, even in the United States healthcare system - doctors recommend or approve all interventions, but when it comes down to it, healthcare is not that simple. In our system, the United States, insurance companies play a significant role in approving interventions. Often, if an insurance company doesn’t approve of an intervention, it is simply not feasible. 

I will clearing with three examples of insurance intervention:

If a doctor recommended X to a patient due to some specific aspects of the patients condition or the patients ability to follow a regimen (healthcare is so complex that often times social and culture aspects affect care) but it is not the standard care, insurance will often deny the care. 

In a more serious note, if a doctor were to recommend radiation to a cancer patient due to some aspect of the tumor shown in scans, but the insurance company has the diagnosis indicating that surgery is needed, the insurance company could deny coverage. 

That is a more grave situation that is less common, to be fair, but definitely a possibility. 

More common, insurance companies can deny care for diagnoses that are more refined, something that won’t necessarily show up in lab results or scans, I.e, something like Ménière’s disease or chronic pain syndrome. 

I guess there’s two points of this post: a warning and a question. 

Warning: while universal systems and single payer systems in general are popular, there’s always going to be a push back from either the right or far right for more neoliberal policies which, among many other concerns when it comes to healthcare, lead to insurance and business professionals playing a significant role, and almost universally negative role, in people’s healthcare decisions. 

Question: do insurance companies or government agencies play a significant role in overseeing doctor’s choices in other systems. 

This is particularly important in a United States prospective because although private insurance already asserts too much control, the idea of government intervention is often seen as a type of boogeyman, and would therefore receive significant, although unwarranted in my opinion (of course) pushback from the USA right.",1637070976.0

I'm conservative enough to have been asked to be a mod here... an honor and a responsibility I accepted.  I understand that when President Trump commented on Vladimir Putin's intellectual gifts and strategic prowess - before the shooting started - that he was issuing a simple statement of fact.  No approval.  Not admiration.  Merely observation.

President Trump is a strategist.  Putin is a tactician.  Biden is neither.  When President Trump commented on Putin's pre-war maneuverings on the Russia / Ukraine border he was noting what every competent strategist noticed:  he was playing his hand well (which was a little surprising because Putin isn't a great strategist, as evidenced by him calling his own bluff and invading Ukraine). 

Let me give an example: I have a cousin who is, basically, my evil twin.  Like me, he is very capable in a lot of areas.  I do not admire him.  Let me say that again:

*I do not admire him.*  In fact, I hold him in contempt because I understand his talents, and I've seen him use those talents to do evil.

THAT is what President Trump said about Putin, yet the liberal media, the misinformation / disinformation bots on Reddit, and the useful idiots in Congress like Mitt Romney and AOC have - once again - taken something President Trump said completely out of context.  Then they try to paint US with the same brush, as if conservatives admire Putin and support the invasion.

Let me throw this out there, because I work with a lot of military guys and former military guys.  (Liberals are wildly under-represented in the military, so it's not like those latte-sipping panty-waists would even know which end of the rifle is the loud end, anyway.)  There isn't one of us who wouldn't be on the next C-17 to Kyiv if they called us out of the retired reserves to fight the Russians.

The fact is that Russian troops are in Ukraine because Joe Biden is weak.  When the US is strong - and is seen to have strong leadership - guys like Putin and Xi take a knee and bide their time.  Sometimes they try to tip elections in their favor like they did in 2016 when they collaborated with the Clinton campaign, and sometimes they succeed like they did in 2020.  This time they got what they wanted:  a weak, incompetent, and corrupt sock-puppet in the Oval Office.

(Throwaway bc I don't want this attached to my main in case my work ever finds it)

I currently work in HR but I'm practically entry level (and at a tech startup). Which means I don't do any of *those* parts of HR: I don't receive reports of harassment, I don't make decisions regarding salary, I don't handle manager/employee disputes, I don't even find out if an employee's been fired until after the decision's been made.

Now, obviously, this won't always be the case if I stay in HR - eventually I'll get promoted to an HR Manager role where I'd have to take on these types of responsibilities. I always figured that by then I'd just quit my job, and go to grad school to get an MSW or something that won't leech my soul from my body.

That said, after a few conversations with various people, I've started to wonder if maybe there's another palatable option, where I stay in HR, take on responsibilities, but influence the org in subtle ways. I mean, obviously I'd never be able to convince any executive team or board of directors to abandon capitalism and embrace a socialist approach to labor, but maybe I could do things like ""creative statistics"" where our salary benchmarks encourage our lowest-paid jobs to be paid more, or become an advocate for employee voices, that type of thing.

I could be, like, an undercover agent of leftism, lol. Hiding in plain sight in a Human Resources department near you.

Problem is, I'm totally lost on how to do this. There are plenty of professional associations that could like me with a mentor in the field, but they almost certainly wouldn't have the right ideological standpoint. I know how these people tend to think.

If this whole idea turns out not to be viable, I'll likely just cut my losses and change fields before it's too late (I mean, yeah, technically I still wouldn't be a capitalist since I wouldn't own any means of production, but still, doesn't mean it would sit right with me to be the capitalist's lackey/dancing monkey/sheriff/etc. The ACAB part of me is too wigged out by the thought). But if it's possible, I'd love to take a stab at it. But I need an advisor, you know?

The Treasury is proposing billionaires paying tax on unrealized capital gains,Conservative,54,qiswdc,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qiswdc/the_treasury_is_proposing_billionaires_paying_tax/,67,"[Here’s how Janet Yellen's proposed tax on unrealised capital gains may work](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.in/international/news/heres-how-janet-yellens-proposed-tax-on-unrealised-capital-gains-may-work/amp_articleshow/87249423.cms)

For those unfamiliar, an unrealized gain is when you hold a financial asset (stock, crypto, options, etc.) that holds a positive value from when you purchased it. When you sell it, it becomes a realized gain, which is already taxed. An unrealized gain can quickly become an unrealized loss because financial assets are variable.

I hope you see how crazy this is. If you happen to be a billionaire then you have to pay a tax, even though you haven't made income and could potentially lose money if the stock declines in value. Furthermore, billionaires generally have most of their wealth in stocks, so it would be a huge tax on them. This would be especially  brutal for founders of companies, who had the stock when it was worth almost nothing. They would have to pay a massive tax on their unrealized gains!

Unlike us regular folks, billionaires don't have to live in the US to work in the US. Why wouldn't they just leave if such a egregious tax were levied? It's also a slippery slope. Once you do it to billionaires, couldn't you eventually push it to millionaires and then less? And if you want change, then why not just raise the capital gains tax on billionaires instead of proposing stupid ideas like this?

As this [source](https://beincrypto.com/treasury-secretary-tax-unrealized-crypto-gains/) puts it:

*Indeed, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled the government was looking into taxing unrealized gains earlier this week and sent some crypto investors into a frenzy with one enthusiast insisting it proved the Biden administration was “willing to annihilate all investor sentiment in order to raise money to fund their reckless spending spree.”*",1635564102.0

Capitalism has many facets but one of them is to drive down price through competition - which is the part I'm talking about today.  Eventually, as long as there is a system that is in place to prevent and punish planed obsolescence, all prices go down to % fractions above cost.  This is because, in a healthy and fair market (which we don't have but that is a different story), productivity and efficiency increases over time.  Well long term, including automation of all things, we are literally talking about a 0 sum game by the end where capitalism wins by evolving itself into something else - what that is I have some hypothesis on (a new revolution in the public domain as well as traditional buying methods both together and combined).  What happens when we hit that point where we have invented the most affordable ways to live, cleared out all margins and middle men and the economic force drives towards 0 because of the unlimited supply (think how digital products have infinite supply but only in a physical reality through automation, 3d printing and so on).  If that isn't the goal, what is ultimately the goal?  Capitalism has great qualities, it's not perfect by far, but there is a point where it may become incompatible with how humans live long term (50-100 years from now).  If you were to select a long term goal for Capitalism, knowing how it works, what does that look like to you today?

Why are you not an anarchist?,Liberal,0,rgs2mq,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/rgs2mq/why_are_you_not_an_anarchist/,9,"Hi,

This is for everyone, anarchist or not. Anarchists can respond to some concerns I have and minarchists can elaborate as to why they aren't anarchists.

So I am very much a market socialist. I know a lot of socialists don't see that as an end goal, but I do.

Whether that final form of market socialism takes the form of libertarian market socialism (i.e. left minarchism mixed with market socialism) or mutualism/some form of left wing market anarchism (Proudhon or Gary Chatier or something like that).

That's my own personal view anyways, this isn't just for market socialists.

So, first, some definitions:

Anarchism: the abolition of all unjust/coercive/involuntary hierarchies (this includes the state and capitalism)

Minarchism: abolition of a lot of all unjust/involuntary hierarchies (certain coercive ones remain in place, primarily: the state)

\-----------------------------------------------

Anyways,

I am hesitant to call myself an anarchist cause I am not neccesairly opposed to the existence of government or some hierarchies.

Let me explain:

I would advocate for a political structure based on the political structure of democratic confederalism or participism: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory\_politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_politics). Think a growing series of councils starting on the neighborhood level all the way up. That would be my end goal. However that is a permanent governance structure for legislation and whatnot. Now, one reason I want to keep a small state is primarily for dispute resolution. See, I have asked about dealing with stuff like externalities or dealing with various disputes between different communes on a variety of different anarchist subs and forums online. Ultimately, the answer usually boils down to some form of direct action. So, like, if a factory is polluting a river and your commune drinks from that river, you would be justified in sabotaging the factory. Perhaps there is a case to be made there. But I feel like there are intermediary steps that can be taken. When I ask about this, sometimes third party arbitration, boycotts/cutoffs of resources, expulsion from wider regional confederations are all suggested. Perhaps that would work, but unless the decision is binding a commune could just go on. Hell, I heard an anarcho-commuist suggest that to solve the issue of the tragedy of the commons that liberals bring up is to exclude people who don't play by the rules. But how do you do that without some form of coercion? I have other concerns as well, notably concerns that anarchists don't seem to win that often. Like, they usually lose. It happened in Catalonia & Ukraine. The modern day libertarian socialist movements aren't pure anarchist movements as old (I have seen many call the EZLN and Rojava not anarchist, I am more in line with the thinking of the Zapatistas and Rojava, so I guess not anarchist)? Idk, to me it seems difficult to coordinate on a larger scale without a governmental structure/body politic of some kind. If Rojava and the ELZN aren't anarchist, but rather libertarian socialist, I guess that puts me in the broader libertarian socialist camp as opposed to anarchist.

Then there are some hierarchies which I am not really opposed to, such as that between a child and parent, which I saw an anarchist in I think either r/Anarchy101 or r/Anarchism advocate for, but I could be wrong about the sub. There are other hierarchies like that that I am not opposed to for the most part.

Idk, like I said I bounce around. So, why are you/aren't you an anarchist? Do you consider Rojava to be anarchist (Rojava + market socialism is basically my ideal world)? 

I think of myself as a libertarian market socialist, usually some form of left-minarchist, but idk if I fit under the anarchist label.",1639547889.0

Question about history and theory: How did catalonia massively improve its economy without markets?,Liberal,19,rycx43,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rycx43/question_about_history_and_theory_how_did/,8,"Hi.

So, full disclosure, I don't know that much about this topic, I am currently learning more.

However, I did read some interesting stuff.

Once  the anarchists split from the MLs in Spain, they basically worked to  establish anarcho-syndicalism. Basically what this means is that  industry was run by confederated trade unions and this was brought about  via a general strike. Basically, they shifted into a decentralized  planned economy. Public services and a lot improved, and quality of life  did go up.

>Although  there were early issues with production in certain instances,  however,  Emma Goldman attested that industrial productivity doubled  almost  everywhere across the country, with agricultural yields increased   ""30-50%"".[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia#cite_note-21)

Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary\_Catalonia#Rural\_collectivization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia#Rural_collectivization)

However, it's also fair to say that this system wasn't around long as the nationalists did take over.

I  am less concerned with the politics here and more the economics to be  clear, not that I don't care about politics, I just want to focus on  economics here.

So, if markets are  required for efficient resource allocation (as I have long believed),  how does one explain the success of economics in anarcho-syndicalist  Spain? Was it a product of it being short-lived and fixing pre-existing  issues? was it that a decentralized planned economy works better?How did  catalonia improve stuff?

Like I said, I am still learning about this topic, so feel free to chime in.

For many years, the social democracies of Europe have fared far better than the United States in protecting its citizens from the abuses of capitalism. They accomplished this with a far more embracing view of the Welfare State and the rights and freedoms of their citizens, or, in other words, the life blood of the society flowed more equitably through the body politic, and the money was spent to nourish each and every body cell.  This nourishment of the body politic manifested itself in universal health care, affordable education, vocational training, strong independent unions and labor laws, and far more services and support for the unemployed, the impoverished, and the aged than in the United States. 

Based upon the 17 sustainability goals for peace and prosperity for the people and the planet established by the UN in 2015 and using the data from the blueprint of the 2016 report by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States scored far below Europe in quality of life and barely looked like a developed country.

"The Femme Fatale, the Witch, the Vampiress, and the She-Wolf/Werewolf: Powerful and Tragic Female Tropes and/or Archetypes",Liberal,50,juc54c,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/juc54c/the_femme_fatale_the_witch_the_vampiress_and_the/,16,"Throughout so many stories, there are various roles, icons, and places women have occupied. Not many as the four above present controversial, strong, and sadly (as so often, or practically all the time) tragic in manner. These figures present both a metaphorical and literal meaning to female characters and women in general (whether human or not). Each has been presented sadly as the 'villain' who must be killed or jailed and/or a woman who must be 'saved, tamed, or cured'. Such figures hopefully will one day be portrayed with so many/some of the traits that make them who they are without them having the endings they endure as stated above.

Femme Fatale- As the literal definition says: An attractive and seductive woman, especially one who will ultimately bring disaster to a man who becomes involved with her. These women (as each of the characters/tropes are, or in some presentations) are physically gorgeous who men are drawn to like moths to the flame. They are temptation given physical form. They are cunning, confident, and promiscuous women who use sex for their means and/or just have sex for fun. These women are practically patriarchy and misogyny's worst nightmare come to life. With this, they are 'dealt with' in usually a couple of ways in stories: killed (with the poor woman usually begging for her life), thrown into jail (with her usually begging to not be thrown into jail), or shown to be 'not so bad' and becomes a 'good, submissive woman'. She is spoken about with desperate lust and derogatory means (and she's sometimes physically and/or verbally assaulted for being an 'immoral woman'). This is a woman who sometimes, or usually, has dealt with the worst parts of men and how they view/treat women. She acts in a way that's best for her, using men's desires against them to get what she wants and needs. Sadly, she is 'foiled' in what she desires. There are some instances where she succeeds (but there are so few of them). This a woman who should be portrayed as the seductive and cunning woman she is who uses her wiles and confidence to take down the men who hurt women lie her and women in general whilst building up the presentation of a woman being sexual, confident, and going for what she desires as something women should try to be. A woman who can get what she wants and acts on obtaining that what she desires: wealth, power, vengeance, etc. in ways that prove women can use what they have to beat the system and come out on top. To show the men who think women shouldn't be sexual, confident, etc. that they cannot be stopped and that women can dominate.

The Witch- Stories of sorcery have existed for practically since humanity began. Magic is powerful and a witch is a powerful woman. However, magic is so often portrayed as evil, and the woman who uses it is portrayed as evil as well. The inner strength she has is something that is feared by the masses, by both men and women, and rumors/warnings are told to avoid such women and/or to run them off. Women accused of witchcraft were murdered in various ways, the most well known being burning, for centuries. The witch is also portrayed as a woman who hates children. She is depicted as a woman who desires sex but not to have children. A woman to have sex just for pleasure is so often deemed as 'immoral' and that a woman should have sex just for children. (This is a trait the Witch has in common with the Femme Fatale, having sex for pleasure and desire rather than to be a mother.) She is seen as something a woman 'shouldn't be': powerful, strong, and indulgent in desires not for the sake of children. She is usually killed in many horrific ways as a 'punishment' as an act against God or the Church, or in humanity in general. She is an 'enemy of faith' and that she belongs to the Devil. The Witch is sometimes portrayed in a more 'favorable' fashion, called a 'light witch' sometimes usually becoming 'too powerful'/used to empower those to likely fight those who are also disenfranchised (ex. the Buffy series and girls would become 'slayers' to slaughter an entire species) or portrayed in a way that she 'has' to give up her magic to become a common woman. The Witch's power is something that should be portrayed as someone who uses their power to empower themselves and other women, to be strong in a way that makes certain people nervous (which it should) so that those hurt by powers that oppress women to be a 'certain way' can feel powerless and be brought down by those they sought to eradicate. To also empower women to act on the desire for sex and not just to be a mother/to have children, to feel the thrill of ecstasy of pleasure, and to feel empowered in their sexuality.

The Vampiress- In many ways, this is a combination of both the Femme Fatale and the Witch. Lore of vampires goes as far back as the Sumerian Age, about 6,000 to 7,000 years ago. A being who drank the blood of humans and animals to survive. In some cases, a 'female' entity who drank the blood of men was one such very early story that continued throughout the millennia. She is the Femme Fatale with her own magic and not just her beauty (which the Witch sometimes has). She uses her feminine wiles and her supernatural hypnosis/compulsion to lure in men for her to feed on (and sometimes sleep with). She's seductive, strong, and highly intelligent. A woman of supernatural prowess who is stronger and smarter than any man. With this, she's seen as a monster. Vampires are predators and they do what they do to survive. But humanity doesn't exactly like the idea of not being at the top of the food chain (though that's not completely true for vampires, but more on that later). If a human woman becomes a vampire, she goes through a change not of the body, but of the mind as well. Her personality is strengthened and heightened just like her physical prowess. She becomes more confident in herself and what she can do. This is seen as an aberration by many. (Ex. in Vamp U, college women become vampires and they are gradually hunted by the vampire who made them, another vampiress, and humans (one of who claims he wouldn't have killed her if she wasn't a vampire; another scene includes one vampiress being sexual and she's staked through a bed with several spikes, both were hard to watch (on a side note, seeing women being killed in film and/or TV is very hard to watch, it's tragic and infuriating). The vampiress who helps kill the others was called 'humble' as if being confident vampiress was evil in itself (the spectrum between arrogance and humility is complicated, and it's sad when a woman is being confident it's seen as 'monstrous'; plus, an 'overconfident' woman is a refreshing as society tries to beat into women to be 'humble and submissive'). She is sometimes killed, like the one vampiress in Vamp U, in sexual or intimate moments, suggesting her seductive nature was also her greatest 'weakness' and led to 'brave men' killing the 'monster'. The Vampiress should be portrayed as the intelligent, seductive, and cunning figure she is. Drinking blood to survive and using her supernatural gifts to defeat such men (and given) and women who seek the slaughter of her and those like her. But also, to use her gifts to achieve not only her survival but her to thrive in life. She would act on her sexual desires and her need for blood, but not kill those unless they are such men who seek her death and those like her.

The She-Wolf/Werewolf- This has similarities to the others (obviously most with the Vampiress) yet is unique in its own way. Stories of werewolves and other shapeshifting beings have existed since humanity painted and drew on cave walls. The werewolf is one of the most infamous of supernatural beings and one of the most feared. A being nigh unstoppable and more ferocious than perhaps almost any known supernatural being. The apex of apex predators, the ultimate hunter, and perhaps the perfect predators. Tied with the woman, this makes the she-wolf a mystic, primal force of nature. Lately, the wolf is linked with desire and one's 'animal nature'/'the beast within'. Such things are considered evil and inhuman, that one is capable of becoming a beast is seen as possibly the greatest evil or one of the greatest. The werewolf is so often to be killed and usually is, but it's presented as an almost impossible task given the superhuman resilience of the lycanthrope and the utter carnage of which one can unleash. When in human form, the woman has some of her bestial traits, including hypersexual and aggressive tendencies. The wolf is supposed to be linked with a girl's/woman's 'coming of age' or linking with her sexual nature. (Ex. in Ginger Snaps, where the main/title character becomes a werewolf and she explores and revels in her heightened sexual desire and acts on her anger. To only later, sadly, to be killed by the one she loved most.) But the wolf is also could be seen as the woman's most 'corrupt part', the being who acts on pure desire and hunger, without 'reason'. Given the sense, it's 'mindless'. But women, like wolves, are meant to run wild and free. Wolves are ferocious when they need to be and act for the survival and happiness of themselves and those they care for. The werewolf also shouldn't be presented as something evil, rather a being whose duality helps sets free and strengthens both the person and the wolf. With women, to be free to act on desire and to be confident in their hunger and strength is something that should truly be manifested. The She-Wolf/Werewolf should present a woman who either becomes a werewolf or already is one that shows women that being free to act on their desire and being so ferocious and powerful that practically none can stand in one's way of what they desire and to make all those who try to go after them realize that they would be/are overwhelmed by the sheer strength and will of the woman, along with the ferocity and protective instinct of the wolf. (As with it, the beast within makes the woman stronger by both existing in harmony rather than trying to suppress/control the beast.)

(Well, I hope this was thought-provoking and something to consider that maybe/possibly could or should happen with the most misunderstood female tropes and/or archetypes. With also possibly presenting new perspectives on how women's lives could be. (Sorry if I'm making too big of a deal out of this. I just really wanted to write this and felt it needed to be said. Y'all stay safe and let me know what y'all think.)",1605398486.0

Hiding wages is anti competition in nature because you dont know that your work is undervalued because you dont know how much others are paid for the same task.

Public company, subsidized firm and bailouts are a source of monopoly. They have unlimited funding, they let people and government pour money into them and then run at deficit for a prolonged period of time to eliminate competition and stimulate demand. 

But once people realize its not giving them any return on investment and stop investing or even pull out from the company and government stop all funding, they will have to catch up with the capital flight to run at profit margin, jacking up price and people stop buying goods and service from them because the price they wanted for it to be worthwhile was when it runs at deficit. As people are leaving, their source of revenue decrease and it eventually collapse and go bankrupt. 

The only way for it to not go bankrupt is if they have finally achieved total monopoly and make it impossible for competition to enter the market and if the goods or service they provided is essential for people to live.

A couple questions about education availability in america and a more general discussion I had with my right libertarian dad about inequality and poverty in America.,Liberal,13,rz14s0,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rz14s0/a_couple_questions_about_education_availability/,5,"Hello,

So again, I recently had a discussion about poverty in America with my right libertarian dad. He tends to think education is the best way forwards and that because of grants and scholarships, that education is equally available to all. And, to him, the inequality seen today is justified because people make poor decisions and get, to quote the man ""stupid degrees like French literature instead of degrees they get jobs like STEM"" and be argues that they therefore end up in debt. It is the old personal responsibility mantra, and that people are poor because they ""choose to"" through bad choices.

So I have a number of issues with this, notably that your parents income is a far better predictor of your future income thanks to stuff like opportunity hoarding, something to fall back on, network advantages (it's easier to find a rich investor if your dad knows a lot of rich investors), etc. There is also some evidence that rich high school dropouts stay rich in the same proportion that poor college graduates do. Plus, rich kids get ""stupid"" degrees all the time, I've personally seen it. Poor families tend to prioritize STEM, there's a reason that there is a joke in a lot of originally poorer immigrant families (based on what I have heard from friends anyways) that ""you will be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer, and nothing else!""
I tend to see that sentiment expressed in poorer families more than rich ones. But that's anecdotal, idk if there is data to back that up.

But idk if his specific claims about education availability or ""stupid"" degrees is accurate. Is it? Why don't scholarships (which they are a lot of, I did just recently have to apply and my brother currently is) prevent the massive student debt crisis we see? My dad thinks it is because people are lazy and don't apply enough. Is that true or is there a better explanation?",1641652353.0

According to distributists, property ownership is a fundamental right and the means of production should be spread as widely as possible rather than being centralized under the control of the state (state socialism), a few individuals (plutocracy), or corporations (corporatocracy). Distributism therefore advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership.

Co-operative economist Race Mathews, argues such a system is key to bringing about a just social order.

Distributism has often been described in opposition to both socialism and capitalism,which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitative. Thomas Storck argues that “both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. Further, some distributists argue that socialism is the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism’s concentrated powers eventually capture the state, resulting in a form of socialism. In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life”.",1638003114.0

Before the source text there is a series of prefaces, including a bizarre one by Ernest Mandel.    
I'm not here about Mandel's literature, so I'm not going into it spare to say it's valuable for perspective on context of when *Capital* was written, as well as the lines of thought that might have influenced Marx's work. It also reads a little like he's Flavor Flav coming on stage to hype the crowd up for...well...Public Enemy.   
There area actually several letters and prefaces that serve to whip the reader up before taking on Capitol which, I think, is a little telling. I can't think of another text I've read that needed seven or eight people to say how important the text is, and why it's so meaningful.  


I will say the most important preface regards the translation. In sum, it explains that the book isn't just a guess German, or a coarse google translate- and that qualified scholars have generally agreed and given their ""blessing"" to this translation.   


Now, finally, onto Capital.  
Chapter 1: The Commodity   
I. The Two Factors of The Commodity: Use-Value and Value (substance of value, magnitude of value).  
I suspect a careless reading of this section is what inspires many bright-eyed communists.   
Marx unpacks that all things have a use value, and a magnitude of value.   
He says, for example, that wheat can be exchanged for boot polish, gold, and so on.  
While white, polish, and gold have their respective use-value of ""1"" - the resources are not fungible.   
Marx goes on to say that because we can trade these goods in different quantities and still maintain the use-value, there must be some commonality among all goods. There must, he states, be some non-physical property about these things that can convert them into a use-value.   
He adds to the mystery he is fabricating:   
""1o0 PoUndS wOrtH of lEAd or iRon is of as GrEaT a VaLUe as oNe HunDrEd PoUndS wOrTH of sIlvER aNd gOlD.""   
He follows up, disingenuously, that this is preposterous, and says ""If then we disregard the use-value of commodities only one property remains, that of being products of labor.""   
Then he goes on to basically say everything is a giant, heaping pile of labor. Marx suggests that all of that labor is fungible. An hour spinning a loom, an hour mining coal, or an hour picking vegetables? All the same. Of course this does not address the comrade who spent his hour catching flies. So Marx qualifies that labor value must include social value. Comrade fly catcher is not contributing because nobody can *use* comrade fly catcher's flies.   
That's the end of Chapter 1, Part 1. \*Record Scratch\* Now let's come back to reality.  
Some of you likely started chuckling when you read Marx's pseudo-conundrum about how we could *possibly* make an exchange between two different items.   
Help me out, Reddit. Is there some medium of exchange out there where, like, I can accept that medium for the wheat I produced and give it to Mary for the boot polish she has? Like, I  thrashed 3 bushels of wheat today and I don't even need one. Mary has enough polish for 20 boots but her family has 5 pairs. But Mary doesn't need wheat either. Could we just, like, let a different medium stand in for value and trade that for goods and services?   


Ohhhh yeah. Fiat. Fiat money was the word we're looking for.     


Now, let's go back to this fungible labor thing. Marx has either sneakily or carelessly written skill out of the formula.   
Let's suppose that, aside from Comrade fly catcher's penchant for catching flies on the clock, he also happens to be an excellent blacksmith. Everything he makes is superb.   
There is another blacksmith, comrade Everyman in town. He's good, and meets the average output needed to have social value, but his wares fall apart long before Comrade fly catcher's.    
In Marx's estimation, an hour of comrade everyman's time is just as valuable and socially useful as comrade fly catcher's time.   
Even in a vacuum where things like profit motive and competition aren't accounted for, society is losing in Marx's Philosophy because it accepts inferior and superior output as equal.

I've researched China's efforts to invest in African nations infrastructures such as building railroads, roads, schools etc in rural Kenya, Ethiopia, and Congo. However these building projects are often maintained, supervised, and owned by Chinese corporations.

Rant: General Strikes and the illusion of a short war,Liberal,83,rwslwy,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rwslwy/rant_general_strikes_and_the_illusion_of_a_short/,23,"Before I get into this post I want to affirm a few things. Workers rights and the exercising of those rights should always be supported, strikes are an effective tactic and this post is aimed at the folks who are always ""organizing"", proclaiming and making graphic posters for general strikes.  The inspiration for this post comes from [tweets](https://twitter.com/ryanhoulihan/status/1477895622028107781) like this and the previously ""planned"" October 15th general strike.

&#x200B;

The short war illusion comes about when the leaders of an army refuse to consider any possibilities other then a total, outright, decisive and immediate victory for there side.  This can happen for a number of reasons, nationalistic pride, a refusal to consider defeat, misunderstandings / ignorance of history and so on.  Now we can look back and see some great examples of this illusion at work, The big hits are the first world war with everyone being ""home for Christmas"",  The French, German and Japanese plans in world war two.  Even more recently the invasion's of Iraq and Afghanistan.  When we refuse to consider all possible outcomes, question are own plans, learn from history and let some form of ideological or nationalistic dogma run the show it tends to always turn into a muddy quagmire that ends up worse then we ever thought.  And right now I see the same mistakes being made when it comes to the supposed general strike that someone or other online is saying is always about to happen.

&#x200B;

So with that tweet its claimed that a 9 day general strike would result in ""we could demand anything we wanted"".  Lets go through a few facts of the matter.

&#x200B;

* Pretty much every successful general strike has taken months and months of direct action.
* I could only find one example of a general strike under 2 weeks being successful and that was the [1998 Spanish General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Spanish_general_strike) which should get an \* next to its name as it happened under a social democratic government who conceded to them
* There is a ton of short term and longer term general strikes that have failed and failed miserably to the point where in the [1926 UK General Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike) they gave up after 9 days and the next year trade union rights were severely impacted.  Both the 1972 Quebec and [1976 Canadian General Strike](https://canadianlabour.ca/the-largest-labour-protest-in-canadian-history/) were unsuccessful at accomplishing there goals and those went on for months.

&#x200B;

Now where do general strikes and war tie in?  They are both struggles between two groups, where as war is traditionally nations and where strikes are about workers vs owners / rich vs poor.  A general strike is not just an action against a specific company but against the system as a whole and the government.  It can be an incredibly powerful tool when used right.  It can also lead to disaster, lose people there homes, create a regression in the rights of workers.  Since this type of strike wouldn't be legal and companies like Walmart can then just fire all there employees lets take a wild guess at whose bank accounts are ready for a war of attrition,  Is it the mega corporation whose gross profit is in the hundreds of billions and can borrow even more from big banks, or would it be the worker who is already behind on there rent, with maxed out credit cards?  So then when the 10th day of this poorly lead strike passes and the workers get none of there ambiguous demands met what happens?  Do they all go back to work with unemployment at record levels and everyone willing to work whatever job they can get for as little pay or do they stay out in the cold after there landlord evicts them?  It is this type of blind, deaf and dumb planning that has lead to such great failures.  These people have failed to consider any outcome other then a ~~short war~~ I mean short general strike and they have failed to do even the most basic research into the history of general strikes.  

&#x200B;

The working class and middle class is getting the shaft right now plain and simple and something has to be done.  But going to war being led by armchair generals who can live off of daddies money regardless of how the strike goes is going to go about as well for the working class as everyone calmly walking towards machine guns across an open field did in 1914.  So if we are going to escalate the ongoing class war, lets put the reckless and idiotic ideologs in there place and look at every possibility, and make the best decisions we can.

There is no such thing as surplus value,Conservative,39,s6bnin,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/s6bnin/there_is_no_such_thing_as_surplus_value/,147,"The core of socialist philosophy is that the worker is generating a 'surplus value,' and that workers are entitled to this surplus because they own their own labor. This is completely wrong and backwards thinking.

When purchasing goods or service on a market, you are paying for their function at the market rate. The seller, who understands the cost to produce the good/service (development cost, time, skill, etc) dictates the price. The price is impacted by other sellers who offer comparable products. The price of a good is influenced by demand.  

Consider a hammer. The seller sets a price for the hammer based on their costs (literal cost, time to produce, experience, etc) and the desirability of hammers in the market. A buyer purchases the hammer based on the market rate and their budget.

If the buyer goes on to build a patio for their family, or a desk that sells for $5000, or a bird-feeder that sells for $10, this does not mean the hammer generated 'surplus value' and the hammer seller is now entitled to additional compensation. It does not mean that the value of the hammer changes depending on the project it is used for. The hammer was simply accomplishing its function for the price it was bought, while the buyer used the hammer along with many other tools and their own skills to produce something greater than the sum of its parts. This aggregation became an entirely new product which has its own price that can be set on the market. The buyer transitions to a seller.

The employee is the same as the hammer in this example. They have a specific price, set by themselves which might be lower, equal to, or greater than the market rate. They sell their skills to buyers (employers) to accomplish a function. The buyer then combines these skills alongside many others to produce something entirely new (the business) whose outputs are purchased at the market rate. 

Nowhere in this cycle was any surplus value being created. Employees are no more entitled to a percent of revenue generated from a business, as a hammer is entitled to revenue generated by the craftsman for their projects.",1642445707.0

Ideally, industry should be responsible to the people. The competing aspect of multiple industry can be done away with if the management of these industries is elected by the people instead of being incentivized to act at the workers and buyers expense whenever possible.

I have an issue, though, with workers electing managers of the industry they work at directly. If this were the case then would the workers not just elect management that will allocate most resources into their own leisure at the expense of production? 

Instead, why not have a state representative of the working class. And then have representatives of industry elected by anyone in the community who works. This would incentivize production as people would elect management of industry while prioritizing production as they will be consuming from them. There would also be mutual assurance of favorable working conditions across the board as one could not vote on managers of another industry that would dramatically cut working conditions to increase production without fear of the same happening to the industry they themselves work at.",1645191455.0

There are two reasons: 1) Lack of investment incentives and 2) lack of founder incentives.

The first is easier to solve: Crowdfunding, bonds, credit unions, etc.

The  second is harder. Because starting a firm take a lot of time, labor and  energy. Oftentimes firms are not profitable for years. But in a  standard worker coop, the founder doesn't get any additional kickback  for that work. So why would they bother to found it? That's where my  idea comes in:

You could do a multi-stakeholder cooperative like this: [https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/](https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/)

Use  an EOT or have a union and have it own like 90% of the firm, and then the founder owns  the 10% of the rest, with it written in the bylaws of the company that  this 10% may not be sold to anyone outside the firm/other than the  workers and that it cannot be passed onto to anyone else. When the  founder stops working at the firm, they will lose ownership of the 10%  and it is given to the workers. To leave the firm, the entrepreneur  sells the 10% to the workers, transferring all ownership to the workers.  The founder can still get paid quite well, and is compensated for their  initial work, their idea, and risk. The founder must keep working in  order to keep the stock, and if the entrepreneur wants to sell to the  workers at an earlier point, they can. The ownership will end up 100% in  the hands of the workers, however the founder gets a nice kickback and  an extra share of the profit for the risk, initial work, and the idea,  and thus are fairly compensated.

What do you think of this idea?

My  only concern is that by retaining that 10% the founder may be able to  exploit workers by taking more value than they produced, but if that is  the case I guess the workers could buy the stock or vote to kick the  founder out of the company, at which point they'd be forced to sell  anyways. So I don't think that is likely.

  
Edit:  


Ok so rethinking  this a bit. Instead of the founder starting with 10% let's say 50% (just for argument's sake, the number can vary).

The founder doesn't have to sell to the workers. They have a futures contract. So they can ""sell"" the stock to whoever, but the workers will get it by a set date. So the founder can still cash out. A model for this already exists in the futures market today.

Doesn't communism aim to abolish all forms of trade in  the first place? Castro had this economic ""import substitution"" scheme,which means trying to get rid of imports while trying to bolster local production i order to reach a self-sustaining economy or an Autarky.the iaim of an autarky is to eventually cut all sorts of trade.and the latter mentioned is/was a common theme among already extinct communist regimes of the past. Japan and the soyviet onion is a case in point:

Incel Soyviet onion-exports local grain in able to purchase Western technology and raw materials for the NEP'a hard industry growth.

Based Japan-Import raw materials,capitalise on their productivity then export for profit.

Portugal and the future of lefitst unity,Liberal,39,s021ar,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/s021ar/portugal_and_the_future_of_lefitst_unity/,14,"Years before mainstream social democratic parties in Europe started to make their ""big come back"" Portugal was frequently cited as an exception to what seemed at the time like a very pronounced trend of electoral decline for the center-left. Despite finishing 2nd in the 2015 legislative election, the Socialist Party managed to form a government with the support of the other left-wing parties in parliament. While many doubted that this agreement would be long-lasting, the government was popular and lasted four years, with the left-wing majority coming out reinforced in 2019. Alas, all things come to an end, and with the 2022 budget proposal failing to pass in parliament we're heading to early elections.

As a Portuguese member of this subreddit, I thought it would be interesting to write a brief analysis of the situation and hopefully get some discussion among the broader international centre-left. Maybe we can learn something about this type of ""united left"" strategies and whether or not they are the future. 

**What is the ""Geringonça""**

""Geringonça"" is Portuguese for ""contraption"" and it's an informal term for the political arrangement we've had for the past 6 years, where the Socialist Party (PS - SocDem/DemSoc) forms a single-party government with the parliamentary support of the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP - Marxism-Leninist), Left Bloc (BE - big tent leftist) and Ecologist Party ""The Greens"" (PEV - Eco-socialist, usually runs in elections as part of the Unitary Democratic Coalition - CDU - with the communists). The name of the pact was actually given to it by Paulo Portas, deputy Prime minister in the previous (centre-right) government who said ""this is not a government, this is a contraption"", but has since been embraced by the left as a marker of pride. Between 2015 and 2019, this worked through a formal confidence and supply agreement, but in 2019 the PCP refused to sign anything after losing a good part of their electorate to the PS. The BE wanted to make a two-party pact at the time, but the PS refused saying it wanted to be able to rely on the support of the two parties and not just one, and so it was better to negotiate each budget/measure individually. Ironically enough, it ended up being the communists who allowed the 2020 and 2021 budgets to pass, with the Bloc voting against both.

In any case, the government had its detractors from both left and right, but overall it has been popular in Portuguese society due to its success in scrapping austerity measures, regenerating the welfare state and securing good economic growth. Leftists often cricticize it for not having reversed every single austerity measure yet, whie rightists cricticize it for spending too much money and keeping taxes too high. Personally, while I have some cricticisms of my own in regards to how certain particular issues were handled, and would certainly like for them to have been a little bit bolder on a few things, I think the government did a fairly good job and was genuinely the best we've had in a very long time.

**How it fell**

In a certain way, the Geringonça fell victim to its own success because of the way it shaped PCP internal politics. The government was so popular among traditional communist voters that these voters started to vote for the PS. This became apparent after the 2021 local elections, where the PCP continued a long trend of electoral decline in their former strongholds in the south. This proved problematic because the southern local government machine was primary support base for the more moderate and technocratic wing of the PCP. As a result of its decline, the party underwent a hardline shift (or at least we think so, it's kinda hard to know what their internal politics are like because they are pretty secretive about them) and the trade unions gained greater influence.

So, fast forward to the time when the 2022 budget was being discussed. The negotiations were expected to be tough from the start so the PS tried to win over the other parties by committing to greatly increase public spending. The end result was the most left-wing budget proposal since the 1970s. Still, the BE and PCP remained unconvinced, not so much because of anything in the budget itself, but more because of the government's refusal to negotiate other matters in tandem with the budget. Among other things, they wanted to raise the minimum wage to a higher value than the government was willing to consider and they wanted a complete and immediate reversal of the previous government's labour reforms. The PS was scared that if they gave in that could jeopardise the covid crisis recovery and, most importantly, make EU sanctions a likely prospect again.

In many ways the geringonça was reliant on the PS's ability to constantly perform a balancing act of meeting the demands of the left-wing while assauging the EU's fears at the same time.

**So, who's to blame**

In my opinion, the BE and PCP for being to inflexible and not understanding the situation, although I also can't stop thinking that none of this would have happened if the PS had accepted a formal agreement with the BE when they could. Not doing so was a dumb political move in my opinion.

**Dangers in the new elections**

No one is really sure what will happen after the election. The left is projected to retain its majority, but with a much reduced margin. More concerningly, for the first time in Portuguese political history, two genuinely right-wing parties (traditionally, our ""right"" was mostly composed of former center-left and centrist parties who had moved right with time but still had an ongoing identity crisis), the far-right CHEGA and the right-libertarian Liberal Initiative, are projected to capture a significant number of seats in parliament. This will dramatically shift the overton window to the right, especially on economics where the two parties defend policies (like a flat tax and a multi-payer healthcare system) that were previously considered nearly unthinkable in Portuguese politics. 

**Most likely future scenarios**

A few months ago, it seemed like the PS was preparing to drop the geringonça after the election and form a grand coalition with its main rival, the centrist/centre-right Social Democratic Party (yes, confusing name, I know), but recent developments have made that less likely (though still on the table). 

Firstly, despite a very moderate leadership (current leader Rui Rio would be considered centre-left in many people's books), the PSD has been working hard to win the right-wing vote back from the newer parties, forcing them to commit to pretty big tax cuts and even show openess to certain very right-wing policies (like life sentences for certain criminal). 

Secondly, PS internal politics are also not very conducent to a grand coalition. While previously the party had flirted with a more centrist/Third Way approach, this changed drastically when current leader and Prime Minister António Costa took over in 2015, leading to a significant left turn. Since then, the more centrist types have been completely marginalized and kicked out of every important important party or government position. I had expected some of them to get uncanned in preparation to a new ""re-centering"" of the party, but when the party lists came out it became clear that that was not going to happen. Everyone in a good position is either a member of Costa's faction or of the ""far-left"" faction led by Infrastructure Minister Pedro Nuno Santos, widely seen as the frontrunner in a potential future leadership election. It doesn't look like the parliamentary group that would be best suited to make a deal with the right.

However, Costa is not exactly trying to rebuild bridges with the other left-wing parties either, so we'll have to wait and see what happens...

**Takeaway**

My takeaway from this is that united left strategies *are viable* and can be used to effect progressive change in various countries. However, for them to work I believe that the centre-left needs to try to be more genuine (no weird political moves like refusing a formal agreement to gain maneuvering space) while the left needs to be more pragmatic (look at reality and understand that their ideal world is not going to come about in a day, or a year, or four years even). 

Hope this was at least somewhat interesting for non-Portuguese people!

You can also just give your kids these books; heck, give 'em to other kids too. If you think the ban is egregious enough, you should have the power to change schools, or homeschool.

- Legalize drugs and prostitution, placing heavy regulation/taxation on both.

People would absolutely still strive to work, for additional income/status. Those who couldn’t would have basic needs covered - homelessness gone. 

Everyone would develop a lifelong learning skill set with free skill-based education. Businesses would absolutely encourage additional higher education with tax break incentives. With universal childcare and preschool kids would have continuous learning available for their entire lives, fueling innovation and employment supply for commerce. 

The cost of all that big government would be covered by a steady supply of healthy, highly educated and emotionally supported workers paying income taxes and businesses paying appropriately for their staff balanced by the cost savings of entitlements they now don’t have to pay for.

One thing that becomes clear is that the Soviet government was full of reformers who knew exactly what needed to be done to save the economy. It's not as if it was a mystery. Everyone knew that the military was consuming too many resources, and that it would have to be cut if the economy was going to be revived. But no one had the power to stop the military. 

To my mind, this rule is true in every country, not just the Soviet Union: there are always plenty of reformers who know exactly what must be done to make the situation better, but often, those reformers are unable to gain the power needed to fix the problems.

From the book:

The military-industrial complex alone constituted perhaps one-fifth of Soviet economic output. Even a cursory glance at the gargantuan scale of the military-industrial complex showed it needed to be downsized. Yet the army was protected not only by its role in defending the USSR from foreign aggression. Its vast scale gave the military-industrial complex political clout that made it difficult to touch. It employed at least 15 million people, almost one-tenth of the Soviet workforce. Most of the Soviet Union’s scientific and technological research took place within the defense sector, too. “Just think about it,” Gorbachev told the Politburo in 1989, “75% of science goes on within defense industries.” The defense industries used 60 percent of the country’s steel, and, though statistics are dubious, consumed much of the country’s overall industrial output.

Even before Gorbachev came to power, he and many other top Soviet officials wanted to cut the military budget. But it was untouchable. When Baibakov was the head of Gosplan, the state planning agency, he asked Gorbachev, then a young politician, to raise the question of defense cuts during the next meeting of the Politburo, the top policymaking body. Like Gorbachev, Baibakov knew that military spending was growing faster than the economy as a whole, consuming resources that would better be deployed elsewhere. But Gorbachev told Baibakov that he would not propose military cuts. “You see,” Baibakov responded, “I wouldn’t do it either.” The politics were simply too tough. “We both knew,” Gorbachev later wrote, “that even a mention of this subject would mean immediate dismissal.”

He showed pictures of graves of young Russian gangsters that died in the 90s and he explained how it became a trend to depict pictures of the deceased on the grave where they would typically be holding car keys with a Mercedes or Porsche behind them, to show that they had made something of their life BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT A CAR.

Examples of US-led election meddling by William Blum,Conservative,1,sxz32v,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sxz32v/examples_of_usled_election_meddling_by_william/,15,"I know this is a generally anti-socialist subreddit, and Blum is certainly some kind of socialist. But I still think we can come together to condemn election meddling and the CIA generally.

Blum has a list of countries in the book Rogue State, where the US has interfered with their domestic politics to pervert their elections. These include:

**Palestine 2005-6**

**Great Britain?**

Go and read various articles in *Lobster*, which describe the way the US and its various front organisations collaborated with the right-wing of the Labour party to stop possible Communist influence. In the 1980s Reagan also created the [British-American Project for the Successor Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British-American_Project), alias BAP, to cultivate rising politicians of both the left and the right, and make them more favourable towards America and the Atlantic alliance. These included Tony Blair and Ed Balls, but you won’t read about it in the *Times*, because it’s editor was also a BAP alumnus.

I need help editing a post about African Imperialism meant to radicalize my friends,Liberal,3,snz1g4,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/snz1g4/i_need_help_editing_a_post_about_african/,0,"Hello, I'm new to this sub but definitely not the online left overall. I was working on a post to help radicalize my friends on Facebook and I need help editing/finishing it, and sourcing reasources related to the topic at the end. I started to get really burnt out towards the end and felt like it was getting unorganized and ranty, and I want to fix that and get feedback overall. 
The post is bellow is for black history month, my goal is to connect America's history of racism  to modern exploitation of Africa specifically (I have a lot of BLM supporters on my friendslist,) and show how America's elite export racism, exploitation, and most of its issues to poorer, and mostly minority countries. I don't want to mention capitalism, or socialism in the post or language like that, because that can easily put off people in the early stages of their journey toward being a leftist, or make them think I'm trying to co opt black issues for political reasons. 
I'd especially like help on how to order the things I'm saying, what should be removed vs what should be expanded upon, and good things to include in the additional reasources section.

Here's the rough draft I have so far:


If you consider yourself anti racist, and an ally to black people, or even a decent human being, and don't want to be like the same people who did nothing while slavery was happen not fighting against, or questioning it then you need to read this, educate yourself. It may seem like the majority of the battle against racism is done, or maybe you've put in your part by supporting BLM, however that can't be farther from the truth. 
Our nations wealth has been, and still is built off the exploitation of others (especially minorities), with both being the larger now than ever. The exploitation our nations wealth is built off of is like a virus, evolving and responding to every attempt to stop it. If fighting against the exploitation of others isn't enough of a call to action, then consider this quote 

""The elite, cocky and filled with greed, will sell the rope that is used to hang themselves.""

It's projected that America will soon not be the wealthiest or most poweful nation on Earth, with the reason being the greed which led our elite to chase cheaper labor and less regulation being to blame. 

With it being black history month, and I'd like to remind you that America's racism is alive stronger than ever, with things far worse than slavery happening to fuel American consumerism and wealth. Most the world, but especially Africa carries the burden for our countries wealth and our comfortable lives, its a necessity to fight against that to truly care about black lives. The BLM movement was important for fighting for the rights of black people in our country, but they are a tiny fraction of the black people oppressed by us, and far from the ones worst effected. 

In the past we shipped African slaves to America to build our own wealth and expand our influence, its a fallacy that this dynamic ever ended or even improved. Now instead America builds its wealth in Africa directly by exploiting it's workers and reasources, topling any governments that challenge them, all under the guise of spreading our wealth and ideals (neither of which are true or help Africans.) 

It may seem hopeless when learning about stuff like this, or seem pointless to the point you think learning about politics/news is a waste of time, but trust me there's hope, you just need to believe in the humanity of your fellow man. The few always will have less power than the many, my hope lies in believing that with a true understanding of what shapes our society a majority of people will think it'd wrong and be willing to fight against it. When you believe this the only barrier to change is educating the many on the true enemy, I believe no matter how much propaganda and control is used the power of the truth can overcome. 

 The elite can and have easily toppled many countries that threaten their power, however the people there still fought despite this. As citizens of America we pose the greatest threat to the elite because our privilege, they can't use a fraction of the tools they use in other countries to stop a threat to their power here. While in other countries they can use military police, assassinations of political figures, destruction of economies, and much more, their main tools they can use in America itself are already in use. For their system to continue they need us to not know the atrocities they commit, the alternatives that exist, the fact we don't need them, and most importantly the power we hold to change things. Us feeling hopeless, apathetic, using all our effort to fix symptoms, instead of the root issues, and believing them is the glue that holds this whole system together. The majority of books on propaganda you read were directed at this exact system, not some theoretical society or far off land like North Korea.

Social Democracy and Education - a historical analysis for the future,Liberal,23,q9xiy4,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/q9xiy4/social_democracy_and_education_a_historical/,3,"Hello fellow friends, comrades and colleagues

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was a delegate to the state conference of the *Junge Generation* (""Young Generation"", the youth unit of the SPÖ). In the main speech, held by our federal JG leader Claudia O'Brien she mentioned that education is something very important. As a response to the speech I answered that it is a huge problem that we forget about education, not on the classic level of obligatory schools, but more outside of school in various ways, for instance in ""Arbeiterschulen"" (Workers schools) run by SocDem parties.

As I took the train home, I thought about the concepts that Social Democrats developed in the early years of the movement - and still continue in some way. Today, I'd like to talk about education in the context of Social Democracy and how it can be a helpful tool for the future.

&#x200B;

**It's the education, stupid!**

Early in the formation of Social Democracy and Socialism as a political force, intellectuals like Victor Adler and August Bebel realised the importance of education for the improvement of conditions worldwide. Victor Adler, a physician, saw first hand the poor conditions of the Viennese workers in the 1870s and 1880s, struck by an economic desaster in Austria-Hungary. In this time, he saw that education was a low priority for children as they had to help their parents in the field or work in factories. Therefore their prospects for the future were bad as well as their life expectancy. Early on, even in the times of the *Sozialistengesetze* (Socialists Laws) in Germany, some intellectuals and smart people founded the first Abendschulen (Evening Schools) or Arbeiterschulen (Workers Schools) to teach basic things and especially the ideas of Marx and socialism in general.

Although the German Social Democrats were under ruthless pressure from Bismarck and the police, they did their best to bring more education to the people as best they could. Schools were only one form of this.

&#x200B;

**Vienna ahead!**

Victor Adler was the founder of the Austrian Social Democratic Workers Party in 1889. Before that, smaller clubs of Social Democrats did the same thing as in Germany: teaching workers. This even went in some instances so far to teach skills that could be helpful for daily work life - everyone was able to learn more from others. In the time of Red Vienna (*Rotes Wien*), the party improved their ideas and for once put them into effect on a great scale. Public schools were reformed under the supervision of Otto Glöckel - one of the fathers of modern public education. Not only increasing the public school budget but too educating the teachers in a new way - no physical punishment and more interactive learning methods between teacher and pupils.

Alongside came an offensive in party education, but not only in terms of classes. One things was the Arbeiterorchester (""Workers Orchestra"") where workers and socially poor people could attend concerts and such for very cheap money or even free. Singing choirs and such were too part of this. But the crown of it all was the Arbeiterhochschule (""Workers college""). Although it only existed for five years in the 1920s, it was a role model for educating promising members for higher positions in the crafts of politics and other things like economics. Some of the teachers were famous Austrian Social Democrats like Karl Renner, Otto Bauer, Max Adler and Julius Deutsch.

Another very important factor was the establishing of workplace libraries or even those in the Gemeindebauten (City Buildings - cheap but dam effective living quarters)

&#x200B;

**Education in modern times**

After the war, classic workers schools didn't contine - but rahter were reformed into different organisations. In Germany, the most famous one is the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, close to the SPD and financed by the state as well as donations. Not only give they speeches and courses, but help students of lower classes with their studies at university with scholarships. Today, the FES provides a lot of courses on the history of Social Democracy and other interesting facts to politics, economics and life in general.

In Austria, two institues close to the SPÖ are important places for party and general education: the Dr. Karl-Renner-Institut and the Jahoda-Bauer-Institut. Both give regular courses as well as help with book writings etc. For instance, I asked the JBI for help with materials for my bachelors thesis - and they gladly helped me with that. Both institutes provide a broad range of courses and ideas that can be visited by everyone interested, even and especially non-party members. The unions either cooperate with the two institutes or themselves provide their own courses from a wide range of topics - often enough historical ones (which I like and were even invited to - as a possible guest speaker).

One successor in the german-speaking areas were the *Volkshochschulen* (Peoples Colleges), where people of all ranges can take courses on all kinds of things - from languages to skills like cooking you'll find a lot there. They are indepedent, but the idea stems from the *Arbeiterschulen* of the earlier years. And: they aren't too expensive, but it depends on the region in which you live.

In Sweden, the ABF still serves a similar purpose, but it is more connected to other leftist movements today.

In Switzerland, Movendo is the educational institute of the SP Schweiz as well as the unions and are similar in idea and structure as the sister institutions in Germany and Austria.

**The future of an old idea**

With this short view into history, I'd like to argue that this founding idea is one that Social Democracy should keep for various reasons.

One is quite easy: providing free or cheap education on various topics for all that are interested as education today is more important than ever for reaching our goals.

Second to show what we as Social Democrats want to do to improve the lives of the people - to hear their needs and develop innovative and progressive ideas.

Third to meet new people/friends and connect with them - talking about what wsa learned and how it can be put to use.

Fourth: to provide culture in a cheap and effective format - to be independent of high concert prices for classic music concerts for instance.

Fifth: providing cheap libraries is a great addition for all age groups - as all can benefit from the books there.

Sixth (and for me the most important): to secure and save the history of the movement. The Jahoda-bauer-Institut for instance is very active in remembering the February Uprising of 1934 in Austria, a very important bot often enough forgotten moment of Austria. Same with the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in remembering the fight against National Socialism with the words of Otto Wels echoing into the future: ""*Freiheit und Leben kann man uns nehmen, die Ehre nicht!*"" (You can take our freedoms and lives, but not our honour!""). That we shall never forget, that education is something for every human on this planet, not for the wealthy elites.

To crack the chains of class thinking and more social mobility - and I am one of those that profits from this!

I even see a great benefit from this: it might help to bring back our old strength and mobilise more people to the cause of Social Democracy - possibly even resulting in better voting results for SocDem parties. As we show that we not only care, but provide help to those that want and need it, independently from being in government or not.

&#x200B;

Therefore I am in favor of not only continuing, but expanding the idea - so that more people can learn what Social Democracy is about and understand the ideas behind it - striving for a better future.

For Liberty, Justice, Solidarity - and these three arrows are surrounded by a circle, by our most important value we have - democracy!

Anyone here interested in listening to the 'Revolutions' Podcast by Mike Duncan together?,Liberal,5,sr5mdg,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sr5mdg/anyone_here_interested_in_listening_to_the/,5," 

Hi all thogether! Quite a few people have complained about a lack of historical knowlage of others and in equal amount many have voiced their regret at being themselves somewhat limited in their historical understanding. Now ofcourse 'studying history' is such a broad goal that as a discription it is almost meaningless and further specification would be useful. Even to gain something that could be qualified as 'broad historical knowlage' would require an extended amount of time and effort, especially if done autodidactically, so it would seem prudent to concentrate ones initial engagement into somewhat connected subjects.

One of the best historical engagements that deal with a specific subject in a broad and non reductive manner is the 'Revolutions' Podcast by Mike Duncan. And seeing as there are many socialists and communists in this sub it would seem to be a very sensible place to start ones engagement with history.

Mike Duncan began his Revolutions series in late 2013 and has since then attempted to cover all the major Liberal and Socialist revolutions of the modern age. He has covered 10 revolutions in the process:

1. The English Revolution
2. The American Revolution
3. The French Revolution
4. The Hatian Revolution
5. The South American Wars of Independence
6. The Revolutions of 1830
7. The Revolution of 1848
8. The Paris Commune
9. The Mexican Revolution
10. The Russian Revolution (Not yet complete)

So far the series has 333 episodes each between 20-50 mins. So a complete engagement with it is a considerable time investment, though each Revolution can be listened to independently of the others if one so wishes. [Here is the link to episode 0.00 in which he lays out the parameters of his work](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/2013/09/000-introduction.html). 

My question to you would be, do you have an interest in listening to the podcast together and to discuss and debate what happens?

If yes, then how many episodes a week should we listen to? And should we listen to the podcast from beginning to end or do you have an specific interest in a certain timeperiod? Would you like me to give an abstract to the contents of each episode if we listen to it or would you prefer to do it blind?

Verizon Labor Union Strike Beats Back Company Attack - Organize All Wireless Workers!,Liberal,2,4s1jui,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4s1jui/verizon_labor_union_strike_beats_back_company/,0,"Workers Vanguard No. 1092 1 July 2016

Verizon workers along the East Coast organized in the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) have voted overwhelmingly to ratify contracts agreed to at the end of their hard-fought seven-week strike this spring. The company had been out for blood against the unions, which are concentrated in the wireline (landline and FiOS broadband) division, aiming to further gut the shrinking union workforce. Instead, the strike forced Verizon to back down from its “last, best and final offer,” a litany of giveback demands ranging from pension concessions to attacks on job security that would have led to layoffs and more outsourcing.

The company was also forced to relent on work-rule changes that would have let management deploy workers far from their homes at whim. Several workers told Workers Vanguard that they were happy to see that the hated Quality Assurance Review (QAR) program, which the company had used to enforce discipline, was done away with. Undoubtedly the company will try to implement a new draconian discipline system that the workers have to be ready to confront; as one veteran union steward told WV, “You can have a contract and the company can violate it all the time. They always try that,” adding, “You always have to fight.”

In the end, the one big concession obtained by Verizon was hundreds of millions of dollars in health care cost savings. Union officials had offered this giveback long before the strike began. The additional cost to workers will eat up much of the 10.9 percent increase in wages agreed to over the four-year life of the contracts.

Verizon was also hell-bent on blocking union inroads into its highly profitable wireless sector, which is dependent on the infrastructure of the unionized wireline business but is virtually unorganized. The company had rebuffed all attempts at negotiation with nearly 80 retail workers in Brooklyn and Everett, Massachusetts, who voted for union representation by the CWA in 2014. Now, as a direct result of the strike, these workers have finally won their first contract, timed to expire with the wireline contracts and the contract of 100 wireless technicians who were already CWA members. This common expiration date backs up the handful of organized wireless workers with the leverage of the entire unionized workforce. Union tops say they “plan to build on this foothold” to unionize the wireless workers. In fact, if this Rottweiler of a company is to be kept at bay, every wireless worker must be organized, making all of Verizon a union shop. The future of the CWA and IBEW at Verizon is on the line.

But the strategy of the union bureaucrats is to rely on the agencies of the capitalist class enemy and its state, including mobilizing votes for Democratic politicians who would putatively appoint “pro-labor” officials to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). After the 2000 contract, union officials touted a “neutrality agreement” with Verizon that supposedly ensured that the company would not interfere in organizing efforts. But the bosses are never neutral when it comes to profits, and Verizon flouted that agreement from day one. After nearly 16 years of “neutrality,” the unions have managed to organize fewer than 200 wireless workers. It took a strike to win a contract for the wireless store workers, and it will take unions flexing their muscle and relying on their power and organization—not appeals to the capitalist government and the bosses—to organize and win decent contracts for Verizon’s 70,000 wireless workers.

The success of the Verizon strike demonstrates that the only way to repel the vicious attacks of the capitalist bosses is through class struggle. This point was underscored on the first day after the strike ended, when workers at multiple garages returned to work wearing the CWA’s signature red T-shirts instead of regulation Verizon gear. The color red is meant to memorialize CWA chief steward Gerry Horgan, a member killed on the picket lines in the 1989 strike when the daughter of a plant manager hit him with her car (see “CWA Striker Murdered on the Picket Line,” WV No. 484, 1 September 1989). Acting as if the recent strike had never happened, Verizon managers demanded that the workers take off the shirts. Instead, they walked out.

However, if the union tops have their way, that militancy will be channeled into stumping for the Democratic Party in the presidential elections. The pro-capitalist labor bureaucracy has time and time again pushed the strategy of electing “friend of labor” Democrats who, once in power, would supposedly act in the interest of the workers. In reality, this strategy has served to demobilize the power of the workers and their unions, resulting in one defeat after another and helping to lay the basis for the decimation of the unions.

Union officials timed the strike to coincide with the April primaries in New York and elsewhere on the East Coast. Last year, the outgoing president of the CWA, Larry Cohen, became a senior campaign adviser to Bernie Sanders. Months afterward, the CWA endorsed this capitalist politician who is touted as “socialist.” Both Sanders and Hillary Clinton stated that they supported the strike, though Clinton’s “support” was far more muted. Now, with the Sanders campaign folding, union members will be told that they must mobilize to defeat Republican reactionary Donald Trump at all costs—i.e., to vote for Clinton. But reliance on the Democrats, or on any capitalist party, is a losing strategy. The Democratic Party is a bosses party no less than the Republicans. Democratic claims to be the “friends of labor” are merely aimed at hoodwinking working people into supporting a party that represents the interests of the capitalist exploiters.

CWA and IBEW officials expressed gratitude that Obama’s labor secretary, Thomas Perez, and federal mediators got Verizon to negotiate with the unions. In fact, Perez only intervened because the strike was hurting Verizon’s bottom line. Despite months of preparation by the company, including training a scab army of 20,000 managers and non-union workers, the strike began to bite a few weeks in. The scabs did not have the skill sets to do the work of the strikers, and Verizon ran up a backlog of installs, new orders and customer complaints. The profit-hungry giant burned through cash reserves. With the strike hurting Verizon, Perez moved to broker negotiations to end the labor action and prevent further damage to the company. All the actions of the mediators were in the long-term interests of Verizon investors and the American capitalist class as a whole.

Or take the actions of the NLRB early on in this strike. When CWA pickets at hotels, backed up by Teamsters and honored by Hotel Trades Council members, caused scabs to be evicted from New York hotels from which they were being dispatched, the NLRB got a federal judge to slap the CWA with a picket ban. The capitalists’ labor boards, along with their courts and their cops, are on the side of the bosses. Having Democrats in power does not change this basic truth.

Speaking to Jacobin (15 June), CWA political director Bob Master told a rather telling joke: “Remind us never to go on strike again unless it’s a week before a contested New York primary when a socialist is running for president.” In reality, it was the defiance and resolution of the 39,000 striking workers that staved off Verizon’s anti-union assault. Picketers remained determined to fight and win, despite having their health insurance cut off by the company and experiencing up close and personal the scabherding by the police, for whom strikebreaking is a job description.

The political program of the union bureaucracy is based on the lie that there is a “partnership” between the workers and their capitalist class enemies. At bottom, these misleaders promote the myth that capitalism can be “fair” to working people, and that companies like Verizon should give workers their “fair share.” But capitalism is a system of production for profit, and that profit comes from the exploitation of the working class. That’s why Verizon has been determined to scuttle organizing efforts of its wireless workers: the weaker the unions, the lower the wages and benefits, the greater the profits.

The company did not win this battle. But as American Trotskyist leader James P. Cannon, who played a key role in the 1934 victory of the Minneapolis Teamsters strikes, observed in 1936, any settlement between the employers and the workers “is only a temporary truce and the nature of such a settlement is decided by power” (see Notebook of an Agitator, 1958). The four-year contracts between Verizon and the unions represent such a truce between two forces whose interests are irreconcilable. Skirmishes between the workers and the bosses will continue, whether there is a piece of paper with signatures on it or not.

What’s key is the relative strength of the opposing forces, and this depends in large part on the leadership of the unions. The track record of the CWA and IBEW labor bureaucrats is written in the contracts themselves, each of which preserves the core of previous settlements. Like many labor agreements, they carry a no-strike clause forbidding labor action until the contract expires. This shackles the membership’s ability to defend itself, and the workers should fight to scrap it. Even when contracts expire—along with their no-strike clauses—the union bureaucrats try mightily to avert strikes. When Verizon workers went on strike in 2011, the labor tops sent them back to work after two weeks without a contract. When the last contract expired in August, the workers were itching to strike but the union misleaders held them back until April. This time around, the workers were brought back to work before voting on the contract, or even seeing it.

The union tops point to the promised creation of 1,300 new union call center jobs, which were won in exchange for granting management more flexibility in routing customer calls. Assuming the company even creates these jobs, they will come with a big asterisk. In the 2003 and 2012 contracts, the CWA and IBEW negotiators made concessions that created a second tier for new hires. At the time, Verizon was not hiring. But now new jobs will fall into the second tier. New hires will not enjoy the same job security provisions as existing workers. Even if they make it to retirement, they would not receive retiree health care—instead, getting a stipend—nor would they get the defined benefit pension that retirees who were on the payroll in 2003 get. The bureaucrats have built in the basis for corrosive divisions in the ranks, which will be an obstacle to future organizing. What is vital is for the unions to fight for equal pay and benefits for equal work.

America’s union movement can only be rebuilt through persistent, clear-eyed class battles waged against the bosses, with no illusions in the capitalists’ parties and their state. It will be in the course of such battles that union militants will be able to forge a new, class-struggle leadership in the unions. Such a leadership will be crucial in the building of a workers party that fights for a workers government, whose task will be to expropriate the capitalist exploiters and build a planned, socialist economy. Those who labor must rule!

I've been seeing a ton of Fox News style propoganda against the Canadian government posted here which is odd as I imagine most people here are Americans.  I was wondering whether libertarians show the same outrage towards their governments 'printing' money. With the recent uptick in inflation many people are concerned that this is leading to a permanent reduction in the purchasing power of most people. So say if you could buy a certain amount of trucks and guns or even other things like homes, Christmas presents, vacations, taking your kids out to the ball game etc before the pandemic. You will now be able to buy less of all that over the span of your life. This is  amplifying a heartfelt concern that many people already shared that they won't be able to buy homes and many other goods/services as apparently the cost of living has outpaced wage gains (although I'm sure you could find an economist that argues otherwise).

Do libertarians care that they will be able to buy less guns and trucks over the span of their life because governments 'printed' money to bail out Jeffrey Epstein's friends (i.e. the American elite)? Does this need to be put in left wing and right wing terms for American libertarians to care? Can't fox news blame it on the Democrats so libertarians will care?

As for the republican in both chambers we should still write them and ask them to support the bill because while they would not vote for it maybe enough emails/letter could get a few to abstain.

Hello name here,

I an writing you to urge you to strongly consider voting for Assembly Bill 1400 would set up ""CalCare,"" a state-run, statewide universal halthcare system, and Assembly Constitutional Amendment 11 would change the state's tax code to pay for it through a voter referendum. (Dont know the state of the amendment btw, i recomend yall to double check it)

Universal heathcare is incredibly popular among the electorate in California. A 2021 PNHP poll showed that of all likely voters in California support a state Medicare for All system by a +26-point margin, with 60% of voters supporting it.

Currently California has around 3,2 million uninsured citizens. By passing this legislation we could get it to zero, while cutting costs of millions of middle class Californians.

Universal healthcare is popular and would help nearly all Californians. Therefore I urge you to vote for this proposal.

Could the Democrats' Stupid Behavior Be A Long-Term Plan To Cripple Lefty Attempts to Gain the Presidency?,Liberal,0,rn9f8i,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rn9f8i/could_the_democrats_stupid_behavior_be_a_longterm/,11,"I have so much trouble understanding why the Democrats are being such idiots as far as policy goes. They've been unwilling to end the filibuster. They got almost all of the the House ""progressives"" to allow them to decouple Buiild Back Better from the infrastructure bill, and of course in an entirely predictable move, Manchin tanked BBB in the Senate soon after. 

But Senate maneuvers aside, Biden won't even legalize marijuana, end student debt or do a number of other things he could do with a stroke of his pen, which are very popular with the American people.

Well, why the hell not? We have a lot of explanations from the media, none of them convincing. The polls are very clear on which issues are popular with the American people, and the Democrats are ignoring them, mostly. Undoubtedly that is primarily because their donors don't want them to. But here's the thing. It would be VERY easy for Biden to do something like legalize marijuana. The American people would love it, and the donors will not, for the most part, care. Also, there was a LOT of money for some American corporations (read: donors) in Build Back Better. Losses from one group of donors can be balanced out from donations from another group.

But the Democrats are apparently totally unconcerned, and by Democrats I mean the DNC Democrats, the corporatists who control the party. Why are they unconcerned?

One reason could be that DNC types don't care about winning. The money rolls in for the incumbents and their staffers and the firms that they hire no matter who's in power in Congress and the White House. The begging letters just change topic, is all. And that's a partial answer, I think. The Democrats are willing to lose elections. But there could be a deeper answer.

See, the corporate Dems know they have a problem. The progressive Democrats are that problem, much more so than the Republicans. The progressive Dems not only threaten their donor base directly, they also support all those policies that are so damnably attractive to their voter base, and are unattractive to their donor base. Thinking long term, they would REALLY like to spike the progressive Dem's chances of winning election, ever. And that's problematical, since the progressives are so damned popular and seem to be growing in popularity despite the mainstream media's obedient attempts to suppress progressive ideas and opinions.

Plus, the DNC types know they have weak prospects looking down the road at 2024. Biden's old and senile, and getting nothing but older and more senile. Kamala Harris is INCREDIBLY unpopular, and their anointed rising star, Pete Buttigieg, is also not popular. Their chances of holding the Senate and the House in 2022 are looking dimmer and dimmer.

So why not, if a loss is inevitable, take the opportunity to tank the progressive movement by letting a progressive win the primary in 2024, but only after the Democrats have stunk up Washington so thoroughly that he or she would have NO chance of winning against the Republican? The Republicans take the helm at the White House for another term, la-de-da. Who cares? The defeat is described as ""proof that America is not ready for a progressive Democrat of any kind"" and progressive dreams are stifled for a generation.

I realize that I am connecting a lot of dots that may not necessarily connect up in four years, but this would at least explain what's going on very neatly: a long term plan to tank the 2024 Presidential election as a tool to spike serious challenges from the left. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.",1640305339.0

Looking for help for a young woman -,Liberal,3,kop0n1,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/kop0n1/looking_for_help_for_a_young_woman/,2,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm really struggling to try to find the right resources for a young woman I met online, who needs some help. I stumbled across her question on the Quora site where she asked a question that hinted at some trouble at home & when I saw the original question, I saw that she had added some frustration that people were rude to her & part of my life staying sober is trying to help people who seem to need help, mostly because no one helped me growing up. We have a saying, that you try to Do The Next Right Thing.

I commented on the post that I was going to send her a private message & I have a 26 year old daughter who is also sober & if I ever reach out to a young woman, I always offer to set them up with my daughter if they are uncomfortable talking to a man. I offered to answer the question & which started a steady exchange of emails with this young woman.

She's 20 years old, she lived in North Carolina, & her mother took her out of public school in the 7th grade & has not only sheltered her from a more social life, but she to this day, actively shadows her, if she goes to her college class, the mother will drive her there, & hang out to watch her. Her mother forced her to take classes that the mother felt were good, mostly in cyber security & IT stuff, but she wants to be a chef some day.

She's been assaulted by family members in the past & everything she has is monitored, she has no idea what her absent father pays in support, & she's never seen any evidence that she's getting a benefit in that way. Her mother signed up for social services & added other children that don't live there for extra cash & food stamps. She controls the daughter's bank account, & she's been getting new credit cards in the daughter's name.

I know that some may read this & wonder why I trust some kid I don't know & I don't really want to write about my past & how I was raised to defend myself, & I ask that you just work on the assumption that she's honest & very believable. She has reported her mother several times, to police, to her grandmother's health aids, to the therapists & psychiatrists her mother sent her too, & its pretty clear that people don't want to get too involved & her mother is talented at talking it away.

She's really very intelligent, & I would say brave as well, but she's very naive, admittedly, she knows that she doesn't know what a lot of 20 year olds should know & she's pretty desperate to escape at this point. The only advice she's gotten from the few adults that have seen the abuse, has been, she should steal the car & run away, join the military or find a man to date or marry & hope he's nice. I'm sure that most of us can see the futility & real danger that could result in.

I've been trying to search online for organizations that help young women, to find her some resources. I'm very hesitant to just report it to her local child services & such because so far they haven't done much good & I worry that if we take action that doesn't work, things will get much worse for her. Really all I'm hoping for is that someone here can give me a name, an organization, something solid I can pursue & if not that, some direction on perhaps making a plea to the public or a reporter that likes to do personal stories of people in need - anything that could create the opportunity she needs to live her own life. I promise you, she's a remarkable young person & if given the chance, she will make the best of it.

LOOKING FOR: Red Pilled Radical Feminists (or just to chat),Liberal,6,7q7hdf,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/7q7hdf/looking_for_red_pilled_radical_feminists_or_just/,2,"No, I'm not a troll. I'm just a woman who discovered radical feminism many years ago and found it not only comforting but life-changing. It changed the way I perceived other women (regardless of my opinion on them or if I got along with them) and it helped me realise my sexuality. However, over the years I've become more and more disillusioned - not just with radical feminism, but with general leftist activism in general. While I still agree with all radical feminist ideology, in particular when it comes to the root of sexism, on the issue of pornography and prostitution, etc, I find myself stepping further away from it and many other popular leftist forms of ideology (such as supporting BLM or Antifa or communism). 

The way I've started to think about it is like this: When it comes to oppression (of women in particular) there are two things that matter: laws put in place specifically to keep certain groups of people from having certain rights; and social stigma. These things usually go hand in hand, but I believe they need to be developed both together as well as separately. It's not just a matter of putting laws in place and wiping our hands of it, nor is it just a matter of changing people's minds without any legal backing. For example, gay marriage laws. It's fine to pass the law so no gays or lesbians suffer repercussions for attempting to marry who we love, but then if the general population still has a conservative mindset, what does that help?

I'm getting a bit off-topic here... what I mean is, I personally feel like it doesn't make sense to talk about oppression anymore if we include everything from what happens to women in countries like Saudi Arabia to how a woman in Sweden is stigmatized for having been a prostitute. The difference between the two is both law and society. In the first example, you not only have law preventing women in Saudi Arabia (and other countries) from having freedom, but you also have society at large preventing them from it. In the second, you don't have any laws that may harm a prostituted woman in Sweden, but you do still have some social stigma against her.

I don't think these are comparable. The former I would truly call oppression (and other sex-based oppressions, such as FGM, femicide, child brides) while the other I'd categorize as  prejudice. I hope I'm getting my point across.. I'm truly just trying to look for someone to talk to, because I feel like I've fallen between the floorboards. I have never found any allies in the left since I found radical feminism, but neither do I see myself with the right.

I'm curious if anyone else has been having any ""bad"" thoughts we're not really supposed to voice, or maybe someone just wants to talk about this. Or I'll get banned for questioning this, you never know...",1515879837.0

How is it only the Libertarians have attempted this?,Liberal,4,s2q1of,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/s2q1of/how_is_it_only_the_libertarians_have_attempted/,8,"So I read an article about ‘Seasteading’ recently.

Long story short, apparently some AnCap types have made several attempts to create their own countries out of ships or artificial islands in international waters. As with most Libertarian attempts at ‘Utopia’, all of these, as far as I can see, either fell apart during the planning phase or were dead on arrival. It’s gotten me thinking though, why not us?

 I don’t know how effective moving out to sea really is as a way for a community/ideology to achieve sovereignty or autonomy, but the seemingly total dearth of any Socialist, Leftist, or Anarchist equivalents to these projects shocks me. I mean come on, we fantasize about this sort of project as a matter of routine! The idea of retreating into the woods, or starting a commune with friends, or otherwise forming some sort of self-sufficient community organized along Socialist values is a constant fixture of discussion in Leftist spaces, but what I can’t see is anyone actually attempting it, at least not on any great scale.

So with that in mind, does the prospect interest anyone here? First and foremost, let me be clear that I know most people have bigger fish to fry than to risk their futures on an idealistic whim. I’m not trying to suggest this flippantly, nor am I supposing such a thing would be easy or trivial to do. As somebody about to come out of college, though, who’s presently staring down the barrel of a thoroughly unexcitable existence, I’ve had this on the brain for a long time, and I imagine some of you have too.

Evidence of CIA involvement in the Alt Right and Reddit/4chan,Liberal,5,hml56x,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/hml56x/evidence_of_cia_involvement_in_the_alt_right_and/,1," I'm gonna post this all across Reddit, 4chan etc because it relates to these communities. This is what I have spent the last month of lockdown doing. I have titled this article, 'The Truth About The Alt Right: A Destruction By Facts and Logic.' Part of the reason I write this article is that I sincerely hope those on the Alt-Right consider its implications and question their beliefs. The other part is that I sincerely hope the left begins to more fully understand the scope of the alt-right itself, but also of the intelligence agencies who, I believe I have shown in this article, are the creators and backers of the alt-right movement. I hope that perhaps they might consider what they could do to combat these influences specifically online.

While the alt-right have money, we have a lot of people. In the article I first outline who the alt right are and what they believe, as well as outlining a fairly orthodox theory of where fascism comes from. I then discuss The Roots of the Alt Right and the connections to intelligence agencies therein, their relationship to the conspiracy theory community and other alternative media. I also give a brief history of 4chan. I then discuss the Alt-Right itself, the alt-right specific theories such as Pizzagate and Qanon, as well as the alt-rights involvement the election of Donald Trump.

From here, I go on to discuss the various different groups and interests who put large amounts of money behind the election of Donald Trump. This money paid for the astroturfing of various forums on the internet, including Reddit and 4chan, by these paid meme magic factories. Those who paid for these factories are some interesting characters, including one Jim Dowson, part of a shadowy group called The Knights Templar International, ruled by a mysterious 'Council of Nine'. Yes, you heard me correctly.

Outside of these interests, I also show the massive and blatant amount of intelligence agency interference in these communities. I then go on discuss the esoteric leanings of many of these Neo Nazi groups implicated in this astroturfing campaign, as well as their own connections to intelligence groups, which are often direct and stark. I discuss generally how these various influences have formed a militant anti left bloc, with global reach and influence as well as considerable militant capabilities. This network forms a Fascist International and has links right to the top of many states. 4Chan and Reddit have been a key media outlet in their growth.

I am aware the article is very long, so if you have a pretty good grasp 4chan/Reddit history, you can skip ahead to the section, Entitled 'The God Emporer Saves Us From His Pedophile Friends' , or, if you want to get straight to the sections most relevant to 4chan and Reddit, you can skip to the section entitled 'Evidence of Glow Posting'. It is from this section of the article that the whole thing grew. I wanted to collect the little evidence I had of glow posting into one document, that lead here and there and now I have over 20,000 words. You will find that at the start of the article in the introduction there are few citations, don't assume that is because I don't use them, I reference 143 sources in total. This is a link to the article. Hope you find it interesting.

"""Anarcho-Capitalism Is Real Anarchism"" by Cosmosaic",Conservative,11,s0a0kh,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/s0a0kh/anarchocapitalism_is_real_anarchism_by_cosmosaic/,116," ""I’m almost looking forward to the scoffing responses from any Leftists who happen to read this one. Any “true” Anarchist surely knows that Capitalism cannot co-exist with Anarchism, right? For, Capitalism and their Overlords (capital O) are the ones the Anarchists are rebelling against! But I beg to differ. The reason being that true Anarchism needs to be based on Individualism rather than Collectivism. Why is this you ask? Because Collectivism automatically will lead to some kind of function of a State, and Anarchism by nature is a society without a State.

Private Property owners are not a State. A Government is a State. A Government is unique in that it has a Monopoly on coercion through physical force. If they didn’t, then you could just choose to not pay your Taxes with no penalty. Wal Mart on the other hand, the biggest corporation in the world, has no Monopoly on coercing you through physical force to buy their products, or to work there. You can just choose to not have Wal Mart be a part of your life, with no punishment. That’s Voluntarism.

In a Collectivist attempt or approach to Anarchism, you hypothetically have no State and everyone is just collectively working together in a unified Socialist/Communist community of harmony and bliss. That is, until someone steps out of line.

Suddenly, someone comes along one day that doesn’t want to dance the Socialist dance anymore. Instead, he’s been reading Murray Rothbard and thinking, and has decided that he wants to start his own business. By himself. Without input from the community, and with his own resources and money. He decides to share this notion with one close friend to get a better sense if he wants to go solo or start a partnership, and in the meantime gets to work to get his small business running on the edge of town, using the funds of his basic income to do so. The friend decides to leak this news to others. Word of mouth spreads the news throughout the community.

Outraged, a shadow overcomes the blissful harmonic Anarchist community. Nobody agrees with or likes this Outcast. This Traitor. Something will need to be done about this person. How selfish of him to think that he can have his own privately run business in this Collectivist community where we are all sharing and helping each other in this giant group-hug of harmony and bliss! How DARE this person be so selfish and want to strike out on his own venture, using public money for himself?!

Not that it will matter. He will be shut down. Because in our community, there is no private property, or private profit. We are all in this together. And if he doesn’t shut down, then things will have to get physical. We will all make sure of that. Because Capitalism is not allowed here in any form. We are Anarchist.

But, we assure you, this is a STATELESS society.

Many miles away, there’s another town, known as Ancapistan, and they base their community on Individualism and Voluntarism. There is no Government here. Each person represents, governs and rules themselves and their own body, beliefs, and pursuits, and voluntarily trades with other individuals. Private property is honored here. Private businesses abound, and occasionally greedy Monopolies emerge which try to corner a specific market, but since there is so much competition, their greed puts them out of business unless they adapt to the prices and services of their competitors.

Some people are overwhelmed by so much Capitalism, and so a handful of people start reading Karl Marx and decide they would rather start their own Communes on the edge of town. Their fellow Libertarians catch wind of this, shrug and say “have fun, just do not attempt to overthrow this town with your Commie crap! If you attempt to seize our private businesses, we will defend ourselves.”

A few Libertarians even get intrigued enough to pop in and out of these Communes at their own will. Some decide to hang out there for good, while others get tired of the Collectivist approach and leave at their own leisure.

Any Fascist authoritarian personalities who disapprove of this Communist attitude in an otherwise Libertarian society will just have to put up with it. If they attempt to shut down the Communes, they’re on their own, and the Commies have every right to defend themselves, and convince others to join in helping, although nobody has to.

In this society, the Non-Aggression Principle is the only Law, which states that the only justified form of violence is self-defense. Otherwise, each person is free to live as they choose. ‘Do what thou wilt’.

So what is the difference between these two societies? The difference is that if you go against the Collectivist/Socialist grain, you’re ganged up on, and will be forced to fall back in line or you will be thrown out, or worse. Physical force will ensue if necessary.

If you go against the Individualist/Libertarian grain, you are free to do so, so long as you do not impose your way of life and beliefs on other individuals without their consent. If you do, then they have the right to defend themselves with physical force if necessary.

# The first society will gang up on you with physical force if necessary for practicing Capitalism. The second society will not gang up on those practicing Communism, but will defend themselves from aggression from the Communists if necessary.

## One society will violently overthrow Capitalists, while the other will merely self-defend from imposed violence from Communists.

## Therefore, Anarcho-Capitalism is the truly Stateless society, since it does not hold a Monopoly on coercion through physical force, also known as a State.""",1641785807.0

We fucked up our response, plain and simple. I don't think anyone disagrees here.

The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.

But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.

We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.

The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.

Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.

These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.

>**Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.**

>1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
>4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.
>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production.

When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.

In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

It is apparent that capitalism can prosper under both democratic and authoritarian regimes but that so far, democracy has existed only with capitalism. Nevertheless, capitalism and democracy are guided by different principles that create tensions between the two.

About the 3rd paragraph in the intro of the quoted research article (below) I linked breaks up the number of countries with democracy to authoritarian (e.g., Singapore).  It’s less than  50% with their standard of democracy.

>The success of democracy in the last quarter of the twentieth century was impressive. However, democracy’s success pales in comparison to the spread of capitalism throughout the world. If we take the minimal standards of democracy as a measurement, there were 123 countries (out of around 200) that could be called an “electoral democracy” in 2010 (Freedom House 2010). If the much more stringent concept of a liberal democracy is applied, only 60 countries can be classified as liberal rule of law-based democracies (Merkel 2010). Yet, both electoral and liberal democracies coexist with capitalist economies. Historical evidence also confirms that no developed democracy could exist without capitalism. Vice versa this is not the case. National Socialist Germany, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore and the capitalist dictatorships of Latin America or Asia in the twentieth century all exemplify that capitalism can coexist or even flourish in the context of different forms of political government, such as democracy and dictatorship.",1644550865.0

Falling US life expectancy: Product of deliberate ruling class policy (Boston Indie) 9 February 2018,Liberal,1,7yycul,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/7yycul/falling_us_life_expectancy_product_of_deliberate/,0,"Falling US life expectancy: The product of a deliberate ruling class policy 9 February 2018

An editorial in a British medical journal has focused renewed attention on the shocking reality that life expectancy in the United States is declining. ""Failing health of the United States: The role of challenging life conditions and the policies behind them,"" published Wednesday in BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, builds on reports in December by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that revealed US life expectancy declined in 2016 for the second year in a row.

The editorial's authors, Steven H. Woolf and Laudan Aron, both sat on a joint panel of the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine in 2013 that investigated US health disadvantage compared to other member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). According to World Bank Data, the average life expectancy of an aggregate of 35 OECD countries stood at about 75.5 years in 1995. By 2015 the rate had risen to 80.3 years, while the US lagged behind at 78.7 years.

The editorial points to the myriad diseases and behaviors contributing to decreased lifespans in America, as well as to the social and economic factors driving them. The picture emerging is one of a society wracked by burgeoning social inequality, a catastrophic health crisis, and a government health policy aimed at deliberately lowering life expectancy while catering to corporate profit.

The opioid epidemic, alcohol abuse and suicides are leading causes of death in the US. The rate of fatal drug overdoses rose by 137 percent from 2000 to 2014. In 2015 alone, more than 64,000 people died from drug overdoses, exceeding the number of US fatal casualties in the Vietnam War. The suicide rate rose by a staggering 24 percent between 1999 and 2014.

These ""deaths of despair"" have disproportionately affected white Americans, including adults aged 25-59, those with limited education, and women. The sharpest increases have been in rural areas.

As to why the rise in mortality has been greatest among white, middle-aged adults and some rural communities, the editorial points to possible factors, which all relate to class issues. They include ""the collapse of industries and the local economies they supported, the erosion of social cohesion and greater social isolation, economic hardship, and distress among white workers over losing the security their parents once enjoyed.""

The 2013 panel found that ""Americans had poorer health in many domains, including birth outcomes, injuries, homicides, adolescent pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease."" It found that Americans are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie foods, drug abuse and firearm ownership.

The editorial also notes that such behaviors are linked to ""weaker social welfare supports and lack of universal health insurance."" What does this mean in the lives of workers and their families? It means cuts to food stamps and cash welfare assistance, the shutdown of community clinics and scarcity of substance abuse programs, lack of health insurance and/or burdensome medical bills. All these factors contribute to poor health outcomes and premature deaths.

Falling life expectancy--one of the most important measures of the social health of a society--has elicited no response from any faction of the US political establishment, neither the Trump administration nor the Democratic Party. On Thursday evening, the US Senate was deliberating on a two-year budget agreement that would increase military spending by $305 billion.

At his weekly press conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that the main factor contributing to the government's increasing deficit is not the Pentagon's gargantuan budget, which funds the US military's aggression around the globe, but the so-called entitlements--Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--programs that workers depend on for their retirement and their families' health.

As the Democratic Party continues its obsession with claims of Russian meddling in the 2018 US elections, the Trump administration has pursued its assault on social programs. After failing in numerous attempts to repeal and/or replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the White House repealed the ACA's individual mandate as part of the corporate tax overhaul, and has allowed states to begin imposing work requirements for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and the disabled.

Discussion of health care and the well-being of American workers has become a non-issue for the Democrats, as they have emerged as the most adamant representatives of the military-intelligence agencies, supporting an impending war against Russia--in opposition to Trump and the Republicans and their saber-rattling against North Korea.

In reality, the war against the health of American workers has been a bipartisan conspiracy conducted over decades as part of a conscious strategy to pare back the gains won through the social struggles of the working class begun over a century ago.

Under the Obama administration, the implementation of the ACA was a key volley in the ruling elite's social counterrevolution in health care. Sold as an expansion of health care, it was in fact aimed at limiting and rationing workers' access to vital medical treatments and medicines as ""unnecessary"" and ""lavish."" At the same time, through the universal mandate, it required individuals and families to purchase coverage from private health insurers under threat of tax penalties.

Both the Democrats and Republicans bemoan the high cost of health care in America. But the reality is that the high cost of health care--Americans pay on average $10,000 per person, per year--is not the result of actual spending on health care for workers and their families for vital treatments. It is because the US leaves the vast majority of pricing for drugs, procedures and hospital stays in the hands of the private sector. While hospitals and drug companies charge outrageous prices, millions of people remain uninsured and untreated.

For the ruling class, the increasing number of deaths of working men, women and youth is a ""cost of doing business."" Indeed, it is seen as a positive good, as early deaths mean fewer costs associated with caring for the elderly--and more resources to pump into the stock market.

The US health care crisis is a national emergency. The ruling classes of the world, moreover, look to the US as a model for their own ruthless assault on jobs and social programs. To address this crisis requires a frontal assault on the wealth of the corporate and financial elite.

The socialists call for the expropriation of the wealth of the corporate and financial aristocracy, and the transformation of the giant drug and health care corporations into public utilities, run on the basis of social need. The vast resources currently monopolized by the top one percent must be made available to finance a universal health care system, in which everyone has access to high-quality care as a basic social right.

Such a social and economic reorganization requires the building of a mass movement of the working class, in opposition to both Democrats and Republicans, uniting workers of all races and nationalities in a fight against the capitalist profit system.

How to pay less for medicines: what can be learnt from the European/Spanish model.,Liberal,38,qaa78w,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qaa78w/how_to_pay_less_for_medicines_what_can_be_learnt/,17,"# Introduction

Medication is a fundamental part of healthcare, because seeing doctors won't help you much if you can't afford the drugs prescribed by them. Furthermore, the same arguments for demanding socialized/public/state healthcare can be applied to medicaments, so **it is essential to have a system capable of providing efficient, safe, and cheap medicines** to the whole population, from the poorest to the richest, the elderly to the youth, and the urbanite to that farmer living in the middle of nowhere.

I won't talk about patents, drug production, drug investigation, etc. for two reasons: firstly, the current system already covers our requirements (cheap, safe and efficient), because secondly, the same drug companies that produce and develop drugs for the US do it for Europe, but the problem with the prices exists only in some places and not in others, proving said problem resides in the commercialization of medicaments. Everything discussed here will come after a drug has been developed, tested, and approved by the corresponding agency (FDA in the US).

I'm here to present the system, commonly called the ""Mediterranean system"" but used in (obviously, with different between countries) **Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain** ([according to this paper](https://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-68512010000200011)). Even the EU Court of Justice approved its use saying that it doesn't contradict EU law.

# The system

**Price control**

The first important element is the price of the drugs themselves. The Spanish approach is quite straightforward: a price set by the Ministry of Health, revised annually:

* Firstly, **the Ministry negotiates a price** (the ""Industrial Price"" ) **with the producers** (companies like Pfizer, Khen Pharma, etc.) The government subsidizes a part of this price if needed.
* The **Retail Price is set by the government**. This is the price that the pharmacies will charge for that medicine to the users.
* Pharmacies will buy the drug to the producers at the Industrial Price and sell it at the Retail Price. If the Retail Price is lower than the Industrial Price, the government will reimburse the difference to the pharmacists.
* This happens with all ""prescription drugs"".
* Retired and disabled people have even a higher discount, meaning that those people who need drugs the most don't pay for them.

**Retail community pharmacies**

The second part of the Spanish system is the regulation of pharmacies. These are **heavily regulated** with important **restrictions on ownership and location.** The most important aspects:

* **No one is allowed to own more than one pharmacy.**
* Pharmacies **must be owned** **by** physical people with **a graduate in pharmacy**.
* Pharmacies **must be at least 250 meters separated from one another**.
* **Demographic limits:** new pharmacies can only be opened if there are more than 2000 inhabitants per pharmacy in that area.
* Pharmacies **can't advertise themselves.**
* Regulation on opening hours: pharmacies must operate at least 7 hours on working days, and the owner or a substitute with a degree in Pharmacy must be physically present.
* Licences for new are handed out throw merit tender. Already existing pharmacies can be sold or inherited (obviously, to a pharmacist).
* etc. The specifics variate from region to region, but in general, the system is the same everywhere.

# Advantages

If you ever go to Spain, you will notice that all **pharmacies are all small businesses, owned by everyday people and not by multinationals**. There are 22.000 pharmacies in Spain, approximately one for every 2118 inhabitants, the **highest proportion** in the OECD. A result of this is that pharmacies (and pharmacists) are closer to the citizens, who know that they are trustworthy professionals who will help them with any questions regarding the use of medicaments. This is especially important for elderly people, who can have problems using modern technology.

65% of pharmacies are outside provincial capitals, and **99% of Spaniards have a pharmacy inside their municipality**. This makes them **accessible to the rural population** and helps to prevent depopulation since access to this basic resource is guaranteed almost everywhere in the country. The ""area density"" of pharmacies is also 5 times higher than in the US (1 pharmacy per 23 km^(2) vs 1 per 112 km^(2)).

And what about economics? Well, liberals and libertarians will say that ""sTrIcT rEgUlAtIoN cHoKeS bUsiNesSes"", but nothing further from reality. The average billing of a pharmacy is 912.000€ (1,067,556$) and **the average annual income of pharmacists is** 24.467€ (28,388$, which may seem low but it is **20% higher than the median** in Spain). Only 822 pharmacies (all of them in rural underpopulated areas) needed financial assistance in 2019. The demographic limitations let all pharmacies have a minimum number of clients and a minimum income, the strict regulations ensure low prices and high quality; but the strict regulation leaves enough room for some competition (I could go to at least 5 different pharmacies by waking 15 minutes) and incentives for giving a good service. Because, after all, who is more incentivised to offer a good service: an employee who works from nine to five in a big company with no chances of improving their position, or the one who owns the company where it works? As you may expect, existing pharmacists lobby quite hard the government to maintaining this system, because it protects them from the savage competence of multinationals.

**Spain's per capita yearly pharmaceutical spending** **is** 532$, **60% lower than the US';** despite having a population 10% older. And this figure includes government spending; without it, it would be even lower. And this money saved does not hurt by any means Spanish healthcare; on the contrary, **Spaniards live longer than their US counterparts** and **their healthcare is ranked the** [**8th in the world**](https://ceoworld.biz/2021/04/27/revealed-countries-with-the-best-health-care-systems-2021/) **by the CEO index and the 7th by** [**the WHO efficiency index**](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/paper30.pdf).

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the way of reducing the costs of medicaments is to **implement price control negotiated between governments and companies** and **regulation eliminating monopolies/oligopolies in retailers**.

**The** Spanish (or European) **system could be partially implemented in other countries**. It proves that regulation can improve the quality and reduce the costs of a service of public interest such as the distribution and sale of medication.  However, I'm not very optimistic about doing it in the US. The price control could be applied (circumventing lobbyists), but the retailer system would be impossible to implement, because it would involve expropriating and redistributing existing pharmacies, something too radical to happen in the near future.

In addition, the pharmaceutical system also shows us another way of creating a market of public interest were workers have more power and provide a public service without having to create structures of administration or employing thousands of public workers. Pharmacies, after all, are **private enterprises that perform a public service**.

P.S: I hope it hasn't been that boring (this is my first effortpost), and sorry for the broken English.

We can’t keep doing this. There’s a simple solution to fixing American society.,Liberal,7,lu38fc,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/lu38fc/we_cant_keep_doing_this_theres_a_simple_solution/,1,"I think we can all pretty much all agree that there are some serious problems with American society, and that we have been on a steady trajectory of ignoring them and/or making them worse. The fact that we have been moving in the wrong direction for so long comes with a certain momentum that limits the range of possible futures we might encounter. At this point, the bullseye of what we can expect is pointing somewhere in the cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic genre. With utopian futurism somewhere off the edge of the dartboard, if it’s still even within the range of possibilities.

So, I would strongly suggest that what is needed now is radical change. However, I would prefer it not be violent revolution, because aside from that being horrific, it would likely make the situation worse before it gets better, and likely just delay solutions to what needs solving.

When I stay up at night wondering what will be the ultimate fate of this society, there is only one outcome that gives me hope. A populous uprising, through democratic means, that forces our government to change into one that benefits the common people over the interest of the elites. 

The thing we are fighting, the source of all of these problems, is corruption, primarily that which has captured the two major governing parties. How well we solve this problem today will dictate how well all of the other problems rampant in our society are allowed to be fixed tomorrow.

I am working locally to institute new legislation to reform our elections, which will allow for new parties to replace the current establishment, or at least threaten them into action. However, the two-parties are largely united against this reform since it undermines their base of support. So, I have dreamt up an idea for a movement to force that change to occur faster.

It’s called Split Your Vote. It’s a bipartisan movement for people who are dissatisfied by their representation under the two-party system and want to support the growth of alternative options. Right now, support for both parties is at an all-time low, yet people are forced to support them because they see the other party as a worse alternative, so are trapped into voting for the lessor of two evils. 

I’m encouraging people to pair up with trusted friends or family who are going to be voting opposite them and see if they can come to an agreement to both support third-party candidates instead. Since their votes would have cancelled out anyway, this is a way of supporting alternatives without the worry of throwing off the ratio of the two-party race. I’m hoping to generate some momentum for a mass migration of people withdrawing their support from the two-party establishment.

You can read more at [www.splityourvote.com](http://www.splityourvote.com/). If you want to help you can read through the site about how to take the pledge to join. I also just set up a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/) if you want to assist promoting the movement.

TLDR: Society is broken because of corruption in the two major political parties, so let’s try and replace them both by triggering a mass migration away from the current establishment. The mythology of which will be people pairing up across the aisle and voting third-party, since then their votes would have cancelled out anyway, they don’t have to worry about throwing off the results of the two-party race.",1614479276.0

The group is a fun role playing group where we run in elections, introduce bills when elected, and vote for those to represent us. You can be a billionaire who lobbies elected officials, run a news channel, be an activist that participates in events, or even just be a voter. If you want to join when you enter the group you would select Democratic Alliance as the party.

"I am having trouble understanding Steve Keen's criticism of the Labor Theory of Value, would love some help",Liberal,2,s01ovi,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/s01ovi/i_am_having_trouble_understanding_steve_keens/,6,"Hi,

I am relatively new to marxist theory (sorry), but I have long been fascinated by economics in general.

So anyways, I recently listened to this podcast: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwavxl-w\_Z4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwavxl-w_Z4)

which interviews Australian Post-Keynesian Economics Professor Steve Keen.

I am currently trying to understand his critique of the Marxist Labor Theory of Value.

He starts to talk about it around 29:40 for those interested, and expands until about 35:00-ish.

Anyways,

This is my understanding, is this correct:

The use value of labor power is the value it can create, i.e. the value and use value of labor power are the same. This means, that the surplus value of labor is measured by taking the Exchange value and subtracting the value (use value) from it. So Surplus = Exchange - use.

The exchange value of labor is its wages, and its use-value is the value of the products it can create.

A similar logic applies to machines. Their use value is what they can produce. And the exchange value is the price of production.

Therefore they too can create a surplus value.

I asked this of a Marxist and the response I got was this:

>Machinery can't add any value because this constant capital will regulate the socially necessary labor time on a given market. Which means once every capitalist has the same technology / machine, the only thing that will regulate the profit / value creation is the abstract labor itself

&#x200B;

But I don't feel that really touches on the argument Keen is making right? Because Marx was using the whole use-value exchange-value paradigm to prove the labor theory of value right?

I checked the wikipedia and found this part, which I really didn't understand:

>Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of  machines to production is solely their use-value and not their  exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of  a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his  claim that the two were unrelated.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-57)  Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are  incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add ""more  use-value"" than it is worth in value-terms is a [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_error). According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of *human* labor.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-58)[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-59)  Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if  the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx  argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their  use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value; they simply  transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#cite_note-60) Keen's machinery argument can also be applied to [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery) based modes of production, which also profit from extracting more use value from the laborers than they return to laborers.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor\_theory\_of\_value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value#Karl_Marx)

Is my understanding of Keen's criticism correct?

So ultimately he argues that a machine can create a surplus. But,

>Machinery can't add any value because this constant capital will regulate the socially necessary labor time on a given market. Which means once every capitalist has the same technology / machine, the only thing that will regulate the profit / value creation is the abstract labor itself

means that it's wrong to say machines are a source of value?

"If Pramila Jayapal takes debt ceiling threat off the table, the progressive movement is doomed.",Liberal,13,r0zsct,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/r0zsct/if_pramila_jayapal_takes_debt_ceiling_threat_off/,7,"With America sliding into Autocracy, and two Dem senators holding up voting rights legislation, the progressives may have no choice but to use a debt ceiling threat to move their agenda.

I dont think they have it in them. Ive heard the cynics say 'that is a bad legacy' for the progressive movement, so what is the alternative? Can Jayapal and others near the left prepared to live with the consequences of Autocracy and their refusal to threaten the full faith and credit of the USA?

Republicans never hesitated to use the debt ceiling as a weapon. The republicans and the corporate establishment only understand exercises of power, nothing else.

If the corporate elite and republicans realize the progressives are willing to throw the country into default unless significant electoral reforms are made, then they will yield to those reforms.

A package of pro-democracy reforms must be passed and if the progressives refuse to leverage their power in the house to do it, they may never get another chance and American's will be consigned to live in a Neo-facist state allied with Russia and North Korea.

The danger of doing it is not just a hit to national wealth, but that republicans may use the same tactic in the future. Thats why Democrats must include significant electoral reforms including proportional representation a-la Germany's system and universal mail-in balloting for every single living person above the age of 16 in every state in the nation. We need federal balloting, not state controlled politicians that gives 50 opportunities to sabotage things.

Jayapal is too concerned with the reputation of a unpopular president, when the American people by and large support the progressive agenda.

This is not like the tea-party shutting down government during the Obama era. The tea-party was largely a reaction to the bank bailouts that was co-opted by corporate elites, where as the progressive left share a wide range of support on many popular policy positions.

Unfortunately, democrats in the house are more interested in preserving the 2 party system than doing what will actually save the USA from a Trump style dictator in the future.

Democracy is the ONLY antidote to this slide into Autocracy, and Jayapal has the power to get it done.

The mere mention of a default should scare Sinema and Manchin. Sure they may simply abandon the democrats and paint the progressives as 'fools' but if the shoe was on the other foot, the tea party would be screaming on every cable channel about why they are doing the right thing.

I can tell you what is NOT helping the progressive cause. AOC's refusal to force the vote over Medicare for All, Jayapal's blind loyalty to the democratic party and obsession with 2 party politics, and Nancy Pelosi getting away with saying shit like 'America needs a strong republican party'. Going along with the bi-partisan bill giving insider ghouls a win was a signal the democrats arent willing to fight. They want to go along to get along while the planet melts down.

The left needs to scream for these reforms now and every day until the end of the year. They need to prime the pump for what they should be prepared to do. The American people must be reassured the progressives can win back democracy for them and knowing that we have nothing left to lose.

People want strong leadership that will use every tool at its disposal to save this planet from itself, and Jayapal is not the person for our time.",1637740175.0
US Rep. Swalwell Suggests Kicking Russians Out of US Universities But Ignores Chinese in US Universities Stealing US Knowledge and Research Used in Development of COVID-19,Conservative,10,t1543o,conservatives,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/t1543o/us_rep_swalwell_suggests_kicking_russians_out_of/,10,"By Joe Hoft

Published February 25, 2022 at 8:00am

&#x200B;

Democrat US Congressman Eric Swalwell from California suggests that Russian students should be removed from US universities but he for some reason has never suggested the same for Chinese students. 

FOXNews reported on Swalwell’s interview on CNN:

&#x200B;

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said on CNN Thursday that kicking Russian students out of U.S. universities should be “on the table” in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin launching an invasion into Ukraine.

&#x200B;

“Frankly, I think closing their embassy in the United States, kicking every Russian student out of the United States … should … be on the table. … Vladimir Putin needs to know every day that he is in Ukraine, there are more severe options that could come,” Swalwell said on “CNN Newsroom.”

&#x200B;

The congressman added that other retaliatory actions should be sanctioning Putin personally and “completely” removing Russians from SWIFT, an international banking system that facilitates financial transactions between banks globally.

&#x200B;

Shockingly, Swalwell never suggested that same after the Chinese released COVID on the world.  We have reported that the knowledge, research and development, and money used to develop COVID and build China’s bioweapons expertise was paid in large part by the US and US universities.

&#x200B;

There may be reasons to address Russians in US universities but to discount the massive infiltration of Chinese in US universities who bring back to China billions in knowledge, training, and state of the art knowledge in multiple industries.  There is a good reason why Swalwell will never address this – because he is compromised.

&#x200B;

Swalwell was caught sleeping with a Chinese spy and yet he still holds a position on the Intel Committee in Congress.

&#x200B;

The problem with the US is that crooks like Eric Swalwell are not held accountable for their corrupt actions.  So when they make statements about anything, they leave a question of doubt due to their prior actions and no one knows if they are responding in good faith or based on their conflicts.",1645798735.0

Published February 26, 2022 at 7:30am

&#x200B;

As YouTube works to eliminate pro-American channels (Dan Bongino being the latest casualty), Facebook shadowbans and eliminates conservative pages, and Twitter infamously bans then-sitting-President Trump and this website, Gateway Pundit, both platforms are openly allowing the Russian government to spread its propaganda and disinformation. Apparently, invading a sovereign country isn’t a violation of terms, but questioning the integrity of an election or saying a particular Covid treatment works is strictly forbidden.

&#x200B;

Over on Twitter, u/KremlinRussia_E is the official blue-check-marked account for the President of Russia in English. There is also a duplicate of that account in Russian language, u/KremlinRussia.  They are actively posting tweets. Twitter has no problem with this. Also operating with impunity on Twitter are accounts for Government Of Russia (@GovernmentRF) and the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs (@mfa\_russia).

&#x200B;

You can also count on the Metaverse as a safe haven for Putin and his supporters, as Zuck’s Facebook allows for a Vladimir Putin page, which has over three million followers:

&#x200B;

It’s unclear whether this is his official page or just a fan page, but Zuck doesn’t seem to care.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, YouTube has been allowing Russia Today (RT) to live stream continuously. RT is funded by the Russian government. It features lots of English speakers, namely from the UK. This includes anchors and reporters, some of whom are based in Moscow.

&#x200B;

RT is framing the invasion as a “special operation” and claiming Russia is only trying to liberate Donetsk and Luhansk, which they say Ukraine has unlawfully claimed as their own in violation of the Minsk agreements. They claim Ukraine recently shelled a grade school in Donetsk, killing two teachers and that Ukrainian militia groups have been attacking the region for years. Much of the content is to draw sympathy to the Russian cause and demonize the west and Ukraine.

&#x200B;

But if that were true, why is Russia attacking from all angles instead of just an eastern front, as well as making threats about Finland joining NATO?

&#x200B;

News reports are sprinkled in around repeating puff pieces, one of which chronicles the life of a Spetsnaz soldier. They also claim Russia has no intention of attacking civilian poplulations, despite evidence to the contrary.

&#x200B;

In a bizarre statement, Putin started randomly claiming that Ukraine is run by neo-nazis and white nationalists. Where have we heard this kind of rhetoric before? Oh yeah, from antifa terrorists in the US, trying to justify their street violence against those with whom they disagree.

&#x200B;

The RT roster also includes an American, who reported on air after the UN “security council” meeting. He 100% took Russia’s side with his biased reporting:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While it’s oftentimes important to see what the other side is saying, clearly RT’s role is to convert Westerners into Russian sympathizers, as they constantly paint NATO and Western countries out to be liars and blame the west for the war.

&#x200B;

So all of this is perfectly acceptable on American Big Tech platforms, but don’t you dare post a meme of a doctor saying covid vaccinations cause heart problems!",1645888179.0

"American Healthcare, a providers perspective",Liberal,7,qsplhb,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/qsplhb/american_healthcare_a_providers_perspective/,1,"One of many reasons for the inflated prices of American healthcare.(using obviously fake numbers to keep the illustration simple)

Lets say you need a procedure done, and the fair price for this procedure is $100.  Thats the amount for materials + labor that the doctor needs to recoup to stay in business.  Okay, so lets say you cant afford the procedure but still need it, so you pay $10/month for health insurance and they agree to pay for the procedure for you.  Sounds good.

Then the insurance company goes to the doctor and says ""we will pay for this procedure for all of our members, but you have to agree to give us a discount, and we will only pay you 40% of whatever you  \* charge \*.  Oh, and btw, if you refuse this offer, not only will we not pay for this procedure, but we will declare you 'out of network' and we will not pay for any procedures done by you for any of our members.""  Meanwhile every other insurance company gives the same offer.

So now, the doctor is forced to take the insurance company offer, because he knows that his patients cant afford the procedures, and if he has no patients he cant stay in business.  But, he still needs to recoup $100 for each of the procedures, and the insurance company will only pay 40% ""of what he charges"".  So now, the doctor \*charges\* $400 to the insurance, they pay him $100 as agreed upon.

Okay so the charge becomes a made up number, and the actual money exchange is still the same, so whats the problem?  Well lets say you're a patient who either doesnt have insurance or doesnt want to buy it, and you just pay out of pocket.  Well....then they pass laws that make it ILLEGAL for the doctor to \*charge\* you less than they are charging the insurance company.  And how much are they charging?  Thats right, $400.  They cannot charge you the $100, because then they are charging the insurance (or Medicare) more than they are charging the self payor.  And that my friends is insurance fraud.

Then the icing on the cake is that the insurance company comes to you and says ""part of our agreement with you is that in addition to the $10/month, you also have to pay a $25 copay for the procedure, and also you have a $200 deductible where we wont start paying for anything until you meet that amount.""

So you take the insurance, pay $10/month, pay $25 copay to the doctor, pay $175 to the doctor (to meet your deductible, because remember the charge is actually $400).  Then the insurance company pays $0 to the doctor (because they agreed to 40% of the charge and that amount was already covered by you).

So the insurance company wins at both ends.  They force the doctor to take their lowball offer, then force you to pay for the actual services, and when the math works out that the costs are way higher than they should be, your anger can get directed at the doctor for charging so much.

Taking a knee,Liberal,5,lu11zz,progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/lu11zz/taking_a_knee/,0,"My thoughts are that when an athlete takes a knee, one party interprets it as 'they hate America, they hate our soldiers, they hate our flag and they are traitors to our nation'.

That is far from the truth.  Taking a knee is simply meant to silently and peacefully bring attention to apparent widespread systemic racism by the police.  

Soon that message morphed to police brutality in general against all races.  Hundreds of thousands of people of all colors worldwide agreed and took to the streets to peacefully show their support.

It was a [military veteran](https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-53098516) who suggested to Colin Kaepernick that taking a knee, instead of merely sitting on the bench, would be a simple, innocent gesture to use to garner more attention to his cause to raise awareness about police brutality.  

Simple and innocent - yes, but red hats politicized it and told their cult it was hate speech.  And, of course being a mindless, obedient maga red hat cult, they started hating the people who want less police brutality like they were told.  

So, using the associative property in math, if you disagree with the athletes taking a knee against police brutality - that means you agree with and want more police brutality.  

And that exact scenario played out in many cities across America in the summer of 2020.  People peacefully demonstrated against police brutality and to silence them they were brutalized by the police and military forces sent by trump**.

Shocking, right?  An entire political party rallying for more police brutality.  Hard to believe, but welcome to America under trump** rule...

As an aside, I saw trump** political ads during his reelection campaign that showed riots and violence with the headline **THIS WILL BE AMERICA UNDER BIDEN!!**, when the photos were taken in America under the trump** regime.  

That should be in the dictionary under the definition of irony...

Athletes who take a knee love America, and found a peaceful, silent way to protest and bring attention to a problem that needs national attention, without disrupting society.  

Perhaps if while taking a knee, singing along to the National Anthem with hand over heart will dispel the accusations of hatred for America and our troops and show their love for America and her traditions.  

Maybe they can take a knee while also waving a small American flag so the 'we love America but police brutality needs to be addressed' message gets out there!! 

Soon after these silent protests, the world watched (within days of each other) a police officer callously smirk at the camera while he outright murdered a black man with his knee on his neck for 9 minutes, watched 2 men in a pickup truck murder a black man jogging in a neighborhood where they thought he didn't belong and read about a sleeping black woman awoke and murdered by plainclothes police, who broke in, guns drawn, during a no knock warrant at the wrong house.

That's when the shit hit the fan and blacks, whites, browns, yellows, pinks and all colors took to the streets to protest *all police brutality* under the banner Black Lives Matter.  It became apparent that one political party fought back with the message *BLACK LIVES DO NOT MATTER*.  Sad

All three of those incidents played out over the course of a few days.  Similar incidents happen every day but don't get the worldwide press.

Ironic that so many peaceful demonstrations against police brutality were met by even more violent police brutality.  Once police and federal forces got violent trying to break up those mostly peaceful demonstrations, the demonstrators fought back.

To complicate the reporting of the protests, the DOJ, FBI and local authorities identified many of the arrested rioters as proud boys, oath keepers, boogaloo bois, evropa (I had to [google evropa when the DOJ and FBI brought them up](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=evropa&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) - wow), Q, 3 percenters and other trump** [red hat militias](https://i.imgur.com/Vp9etje.jpg).

I wish I still had the link, but many mayors & governors, including Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond, Virginia identified the rioters as white supremacists marching under the banner of Black Lives Matter, to implicate them in the violence.  Granted, many BLM protestors fought back, but the extreme right and the trump** police/militia armed for war played a major role in the violence that ensued.  

Very early in the protests the media showed a masked man dressed in black holding a black umbrella (it wasn't raining) breaking windows to incite a crowd to riot.  Investigations revealed he was a detective and the umbrella was a signal to police to leave him alone.

Something that really stuck with me was watching a vigil by many violin players gathered to pay tribute to Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black violinist and massage therapist from Aurora, Colorado, who died after being placed in a chokehold by police and being sedated by paramedics.  

During lunch breaks, he brought his instruments to animal shelters and played for the abandoned animals, believing that music put them at ease.  Many violin players played together in a park to honor his memory and support bringing attention to police brutality..

The video showed people, many sitting and swaying and just listening to music, when all of a sudden police armed for war came in violently, without being provoked, to brutally break up the vigil with tear gas, rubber bullets and batons.  

American citizens were silently sitting listening to music when the trump** mercenaries crushed them.... 

Today everyone has a video camera in their pocket, and the massive, daily documentation of police brutality, of every color, has received the attention needed to show the seriousness of police brutality in even the simplest interactions with the public.  

This has led to a justified distrust and even hatred of police and the federal troops trump** and his government send in to violently disperse any crowds, no matter how peaceful and are merely exercising their Constitutional right to assembly.

Many believe the cherry on top of this horrendous chapter in American history was when trump** ordered his military troops and police force to violently break up a peaceful demonstration with tear gas and rubber bullets and batons in Lafayette Square park in front of St John's Church across from the White House.  

Once a path was cleared, trump** walked to the church he has never attended [surrounded by his military guard](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/la-attorney-resists-the-call-to-reopen-courts-amid-covid-19/trump-response-protests/@@images/rectangular_image/page-header?v=1591135700.32)  to [hold up a Bible (upside down)](https://www.ncronline.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_full_width/public/20200602T0722-264-CNS-USA-PROTEST.jpg?itok=GnnbbQWM) which he has never read in a staged [photo-op](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/06/05/george-floyd-protests-trump-church-photo-curfew-park/3127684001/) for his evangelical base who choose what parts of the Bible to follow and which to ignore.

Is it any wonder why there is so much distrust for the trump** administration and police??

That is why athletes take a knee during the National Anthem, it has nothing to do with hating America or hating soldiers or hating the flag, merely peacefully & silently bringing national attention to widespread police brutality.

Perhaps the most ironic lesson to be taken from last summer is that peaceful protests against violent police brutality were met by even more violent, senseless police brutality to quiet their voices!

A lasting tribute to America under trump** we should all be ashamed of...

America is currently on the border of this, with many workers not being able to afford all the things above. The problem for America comes down to corporations opting to spend their profits each year on expansion, rather than employee pay. I'm not going to give my opinion on a solution, but to me, that seems to be the core of the problem. And if you think this isn't a problem, look around. It's not a few dozen workers, it's the whole country, throwing a fit.

Capitalism & Depression,Liberal,20,so6yxu,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/so6yxu/capitalism_depression/,7,"Content warning: Depression and suicide

(Narrated version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPFxQhA4lYk))

Depression seems to be a common problem in leftist circles. When I gained class consciousness, I realized things that ended up hurting me to a level of pain that makes me contemplate whether being alive is worth it. It’s the realization that what makes this world a horrible place is a system that is entirely unnecessary. A system that robs us of most of our day’s time, our energy, and our humanity. A system that makes it near impossible to self actualize or enjoy life without being hindered by wage slavery.

I’m comfortable now saying publicly that I’ve suffered with suicidal thoughts and tendencies for a long time. Now I’m here as a graduate who realizes they didn’t really have a childhood, and now looking towards the future, realizes that adulthood most likely isn’t going to make up for such a loss. A lack of friends when I was younger isn’t terribly difficult to fix, but escaping the mental health issues that arise from working under capitalism is an entirely new magnitude of difficulty.

Sadly, I am not writing this because I have answers, instead, I hope to analyze what causes depression under capitalism, and will look at mental health issues as an environmental problem.

There are a few main factors that cause people to be depressed. Three prevalent ones are:

1. Feeling that you or your work/efforts are meaningless
2. Feeling trapped or unable to escape a problem
3. Feeling that a problem is outside of your control

The first of these three has to do with meaning. When a person’s labor or existence in society isn’t valued, they will end up coming to the conclusion that their future existence either isn’t wanted or necessary. It’s why a lot of depressed people consider themselves a burden. Sometimes even blaming themselves and reminiscing on problems which make their condition even worse. Capitalism in its current practice does exactly the kinds of things that can cause these problems. It does not fully appreciate the labor of its workers as they are not fully rewarded for their toil. Not only is surplus value extracted from them, meaning they don’t get the full worth of their work, but additionally, [their pay doesn’t keep up with inflation, nor production output](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/10/03/us-wages-have-been-rising-faster-than-productivity-for-decades/#246f24c57342). Of course, pay isn’t everything, someone can easily decide that a low-paying job is worth it as long as it is fun or meaningful. Problem is, work under capitalism isn’t meaningful either. Putting aside the existence of bullshit jobs, workers under capitalism are alienated from their own labor. While capitalists do not value labor, the same goes for the laborer. A capitalist doesn’t need *you specifically*, they just need someone who can perform similar tasks to you. This leads them to [treat mildly difficult employees, such union organizers, as easily replaceable nuisances](https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/26/technology/tesla-uaw-firings/index.html). Nobody likes being arbitrarily let go, but when businesses realize that reducing labor costs increases profits, your interests in the security of your job are no longer valued by the person who has control of said security.

The second thing that causes depression is the feeling of being trapped or being unable to escape an issue or problem. Putting aside that moving to a better country or state for most people is unrealistic, capitalism isn’t a problem we can run away from. No matter if you move to Germany or Denmark, Vietnam or China, you will not be able to ""move away"" from capitalism. The ability to bail from an uncomfortable situation is important for one’s mental well-being as it does not force them into situations that can deteriorate their mental health. Unfortunately, this system is something we cannot bail from. Capitalism is not voluntary. It constantly has a gun to your head that forces you to work to survive. If you decide not to participate, if you decide to bail, you have effectively surrendered your life in capitalism. This requirement of work to survive is also part of the reason that some people are forced into careers they don’t enjoy. [A majority of workers are disengaged from their work](https://www.inc.com/sonia-thompson/68-percent-of-employees-are-disengaged-but-there-i.html), and it’s for a damn good reason. When people are unhappy with their work, or want better wages for their time, it is not common that an alternative job opportunity will arise. People do not willingly pick bad jobs. They are there for reasons outside of their control.

Speaking of control, a perceived lack of it is the third major factor that causes depression. In psychology, it is considered an “external locus of control” which means that you believe your problems are due to factors outside of your control such as luck. In this case, that thing outside of your control is capitalism. Many people with an internal locus of control have tried to tell themselves that they can control their material conditions under capitalism. That if they just “work hard enough” they will be OK. General statistics would disprove this. Around 60% of Americans made under 40k in 2020, and 50% of them made under 30k (US SSA Wage Statistics 2020). As an individual, [these kinds of salaries would get you considered as “low-income”](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/20/15343720/housing-income-limits) in [places where most of America’s population presides](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_population_map.png). Considering how common it is for Americans to be low income, I have my doubts about people who say that working hard will allow you to escape this problem. 60% of Americans certainly aren’t lazy; that’s ridiculous. There is a different problem afoot, and that’s capitalism. Problem is, our efforts might not be effective enough to make people *feel* that they have control over their capitalist problems. While many are now starting unions, going to protests, or engaging in direct action, these forms of praxis alone are not always sufficient enough to form the revolutionary optimism needed to pull people out of their capitalist-caused external locus of control. We may fight, but many workers still have to suffer in the meantime, which can be discouraging. Your will to live shouldn’t have to originate from the struggle against what stole it in the first place.

To explain this better, I’ll use an analogy. If you’re in an abusive relationship, your life’s meaning shouldn't have to be about leaving it, putting up with it, or reliving it when it’s over. It should be about living beyond abuse. Same goes for capitalism. It is depressing to make one’s entire life about fighting the system that abuses them when their life could be about flourishing from the absence of said system. Nobody’s meaning should have to come from fighting what abuses them. Their meaning should come from self actualization and true fulfillment. This does not mean I am against direct action, but I do have my critiques. We are in a system where change is made intentionally slow, and this will inevitably kill us. Both mentally and physically. We are in time sensitive situations that unveil the weaknesses of politicians taking their time or trying to be “civil” while their constituents inhabit a living hell. I am not here for gradualism, nor am I here to fight a long time for changes that will be rolled back instantly. I do not mind being a revolutionary, but I want the ideas of our comrades to matter. Considering how much the realization of our suffering hurts, I’d hate to see this system live long enough for someone else to have to feel the same way.

As someone who likes to dabble in psychology, I happen to have my own opinions about certain arguments within the subject. One of those being nature vs nurture. The argument over whether your genetics are more or less important in determining your behavior than the environment you were raised in. While I acknowledge that certain behaviors will arise from your genetics such as likelihood of schizophrenia and type of temperament, it is my opinion that generally how you were raised, and more importantly, your environment, will affect your behavior more than genetics. This is what leads me to come to the theory that mental health problems, and in this case specifically, depression, are environmental issues. Again, I do acknowledge that chemical imbalances exist, but for many other people this might not be the case. Curing depression isn’t easy; like dreams, psychologists admit they don’t entirely know what happens on a neurological level when these things occur. This might be because we are trying to look at depression as purely a neurological process or something we can cure the same way we would a physical illness. Certainly, it is simpler and easier to ""fix"" an individual than the environment they preside in.

A therapist isn’t going to be able to change your material conditions, nor is any brand of depression medication. While they may allow you to look at the situation differently, it ultimately won’t change the environment you’re in. [During the economic crisis of 2008, and for some time after, there was a spike in suicides, upwards of around ten thousand of them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniehaiken/2014/06/12/more-than-10000-suicides-tied-to-economic-crisis-study-says/#64e158ad7ae2). This is not a coincidence, and [studies that have analyzed larger periods of time were able to find a correlation between rising unemployment rates and a higher risk of suicide](https://www.thejournal.ie/unemployment-4500-deaths-by-suicide-1930270-Feb2015/). As I said already, people don’t like being arbitrarily let go by being fired, so it makes sense that their mental health can spiral downwards as unemployment becomes a problem for them.

We are trapped in this environment. It’s either unemployment and the suicide that follows, or actually having a job, and suffering alienation while surrendering your humanity just to be given the capitalist privilege of being allowed to live.

As I have said at the beginning of this essay, I don’t have solutions. I really wish I did because if that was the case, I wouldn’t mentally be in this place right now. This all just happens to be my best understanding of the problem at hand, and how it might be affecting other people. Maybe, I’m not meant to be here. I certainly don’t think I will be able to handle this absurd environment, and will have to take the only avenue that is available for me to escape it. I did not suffer during my childhood only to be given an adulthood that forces me to deal with even greater problems when all I want to do is recover. While I still have some hopes for the future that might save me from some of the emotional problems I associate with capitalism, I feel as if I am dangling my life by thin threads.

Accurate Definition of Socialism,Conservative,0,rn8bap,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/rn8bap/accurate_definition_of_socialism/,208,"Socialism holds the collective as superior to the individuals and forms hierarchies around the leaders of the collective. It rejects private property rights so that a collective of workers can forcibly and violently remove private property from others to control it. The decision on how to use and distribute that property is usually decided by the leaders of the worker collective, but can sometimes be put to a majority vote where minority voices will be excluded entirely. Typically, leaders convince a majority to vote for them by inducing feelings of envy and frustration in the public and using conspiracy theories to scapegoat minorities as the root cause of the majority's problems. 

Socialism has lead to the deaths of many millions of its own citizens. Specifically:

* Ideological collectivist economic projects that resulted in the starvation of millions
* Elimination of different political or religious populations through political purges

* Collective rights above Individual rights - illiberal
* Scapegoating minorities - populist
* Propensity to use force and violence - oppressive
* The state was unopposed with a high degree of political and economic power - authoritarian
   * Socialism is against political pluralism
* Has a system of beliefs about collective justice - ideological

A democratic form of Government presupposes a democratic form of society. The formal framework of democracy is of no value and would indeed be a misfit if there was no social democracy. The politicals never realized that democracy was not a form of Government. It was essentially a form of society. It may not be necessary for a democratic society to be marked by unity, by community of purpose, by loyalty to public ends and by mutuality of sympathy. But it does unmistakably involve two things. The first is an attitude of mind, an attitude of respect and equality towards their fellows. The second is a social organization free from rigid social barriers. Democracy is incompatible and inconsistent with isolation and exclusiveness, resulting in the distinction between the privileged and the unprivileged.

So the reason a whopping 70% of people say they are middle class has to do with how Americans want their income perceived.

As a middle-class American,  you are a representative of the center of society,   You have a voice in the political process. You’re not so economically precarious that you feel powerless and completely dependent on gifts from others.  Ultimately, if you are in the middle class, you are the norm or the control group.

With it's founder, [John Cowperthwaite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Cowperthwaite) going so far as to ban the collection of economic data to discourage government intervention:

>He refused to compile GDP statistics arguing that such data was not useful to managing an economy and would lead to officials meddling in the economy. He was once asked what the key thing that poor countries could do to improve their growth. He replied: **""They should abolish the office of national statistics.""**

This banning of even collecting statistics is even more anti-government than most libertarians I've seen.

They’ve united with venture capital and Silicon Valley in a depressingly on-brand pivot to the gig economy.

Saving money on labor, regardless of the outcome for workers and patients, is the name of the game in hospital management. It’s how we got into this mess to begin with. And it seems the responsible parties know better than to let a good crisis go to waste.

Companies like CareRev and its competitors — ShiftMed, Trusted Health, Nomad Health, connectRN — are raising tens of millions of dollars in venture capital investment because they provide value to their customers. But their customers are not the health care workers who want to earn a living on their platforms. Their actual customers are for-profit hospitals desperate to cut labor costs.

The ultimate problem is that it treats workers and patients as little more than inputs in a system designed to generate profit. Do we want a health care system designed to heal us when we’re sick, or do we want a business scheme designed to enrich a few executives at everyone else’s expense?",1643252541.0

Freedom of movement is the idea of being able to travel or move about, nation to nation, even within a nation, without someone asking to ""see your papers"".

As a libertarian philosophy, its definitely rooted in freedom and the NAP.  

&nbsp;

Where we run into practical issues, atleast in the United States, is when you have a government which provides an incentive.

Meaning government/tax payer handouts: welfare, food stamps, free education, free healthcare, free housing etc.

If there were no government handout system, for citizens and non-citizens alike, but especially for non-citizens, people would have much less of an issue with immigration, freedom of movement etc, even ""open"" borders.

Hear me out! Tuition fees are a good thing.,Liberal,3,qxqkak,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qxqkak/hear_me_out_tuition_fees_are_a_good_thing/,37,"Here in the UK, the Labour party put the abolishing of tuition fees in their manifesto, this pledge won the support of a great many young people. However, [this](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/9217) piece from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that these policies would increase the government deficit by around £12.7 billion, of which £11 billion is from scrapping fees. It concludes that Labour’s Higher Education proposals will cost £8bn per year, although increase the deficit by more. Graduates who earn most in the future would benefit most.

On a recent thread on this sub, a comment in response to mine showing support for tuition fees went like this:

[College is even free in ex yugolavia which is by no means social democratic lmoa. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qx6tnj/comment/hl91qzv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[ah I remember this c\*ntrist](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qx6tnj/comment/hl91qzv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Btw, that is not true, only one ex-Yugoslav republic has free college, unsurprisingly, it's Slovenia.

I think [this link](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1501.pdf), which talks in great detail about the situation before tuition fees in England, the issue which led to their establishment and their result, is a good source for this issue from one of the most prestigious economic institutes in the world. This report was co-written by its head, Stephen Machin.

It ultimately concludes

>we study the English higher education system which has, in just two decades, moved from a free college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world. Our findings suggest that England’s shift has resulted in increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. In contrast to other systems with high tuition fees, the English system is distinct in that its income-contingent loan system keeps university free at the point of entry, and provides students with comparatively generous assistance for living expenses. We conclude that tuition fees, at least in the English case supported their goals of increasing quality, quantity, and equity in higher education. 

We must also look at how people pay back this debt.

If I were to start paying off my debts tomorrow, here is how my repayment would work:

The thresholds are £524 a week or £2,274 a month (before tax and other deductions). 

I'm paid weekly and your income changes each week. This week my income was £600, which is over the Plan 2 weekly threshold of £524.

My income was £76 over the threshold (£600 minus £524). I will pay back £6 (9% of £76) this week.

I will pay back just 1% of my weekly earnings each week. 

It is not like I have to pay the 100,000 of debt I will be left with by the end of 30 years with interest because, after 30 years, all of my debt left unpaid will be written off.

[This is a cool tool](https://www.student-loan-calculator.co.uk/) you can use to figure out at what wage and how much you would pay back for your debts in the UK.

Fundamentally, there isn't much the UK does better than Europe at, but universities and upper education including tuition fees is one of the things we exceed at. We have a greater proportion of people from lower socio-economic backgrounds going to university and it has only grown since the measures of the coalition government.

I don't think we should be throwing billions of pounds at removing tuition fees so fewer poor people can go to university. 

If you read this far, thank you! You probably disagree with me but thanks for reading what I have to say.

Edit: I am only talking about the English tuition fee system, I don't know much about the American model.

Nazism falls not far from it's tree(fascism) only, The nazis newly found addiction pushed them further towards a much ambitious goal,and that is to carry out socialism only now,with the might of nationalism and race combined. and this is apparent upon the drafting of the Nazi's electoral manifesto(25-point plan) back in the 20's



The program of the NSDAP


The program is the political foundation of the NSDAP and accordingly the primary political law of the State. It has been made brief and clear intentionally.
All legal precepts must be applied in the spirit of the party program.
Since the taking over of control, the Fuehrer has succeeded in the realization of essential portions of the Party program from the fundamentals to the detail.
The Party Program of the NSDAP was proclaimed on the 24 February 1920 by Adolf Hitler at the first large Party gathering in Munich and since that day has remained unaltered. Within the national socialist philosophy is summarized in 25 points:
1. We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of peoples.
2. We demand equality of rights for the German people in respect to the other nations; abrogation of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.
3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people, and colonization for our surplus population.
4. Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently no Jew can be a member of the race.
5. Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest, and must be
under the authority of legislation for foreigners.
6. The right to determine matters concerning administration and law belongs only to the citizen.
Therefore we demand that every public office, of any sort whatsoever, whether in the Reich, the county or municipality, be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting parliamentary economy, office- holding only according to party inclinations without consideration of character or abilities.
7. We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to sustain the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich.
8. Any further immigration of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since the 2 August 1914, be forced immediately to leave the Reich.
9. All citizens must have equal rights and obligations.
10. The first obligation of every citizen must be to work both spiritually and physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all
Consequently we demand:
11. Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of rent-slavery.
12. In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore we demand the total confiscation of all war profits.
13. We demand the nationalization of all (previous) associated industries (trusts).
14. We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries.
15. We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.
16. We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate
communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.
17. We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land.
18. We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, Schieber1 and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.
19. We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order.
20. The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the State must be striven for by the school [Staatsbuergerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the State of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.
21. The State is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.
22. We demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army.
23. We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that a: All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race b: Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language c: Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications or any influence on them and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications which are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.
24. We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: common utility precedes individual utility.
1 “Trafficker”
 
25. For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.

A Hypothetical,Conservative,0,3903hh,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/3903hh/a_hypothetical/,9,"Let's say you're in a libertarian utopia, and you buy some large tracts of land. You don't want anybody violating this property of yours, and decide to shoot trespassers on sight. This must be respected, nobody can infringe upon your freedom to say what goes on in your own damn property, no faggot government or nothin. But it seems that your lands stretch over a dirt road that you overlooked, and is used by the locals to get here and there casually. This doesn't stand with you, so you hire the pinkertons. They capture anyone crossing through your land and kill them. Now, since you are an enterprising person, you seek access to the ocean, and you work out a deal with a corporation wherein you buy some land which borders the sea. It turns out there are quite a few people living there, and you decide it would be unprofitable to try to purge them all together. But since they won't leave your property when you request them to, and they are not allowed to be there, you decide they might as well be put to good use. You send the pinkertons to force them into fishing and working in mines, all with quotas they must fulfill. You profit greatly from this, and buy more land. There are people living here too. You follow the same procedure, and after years pass you have millions of people under your freedom of jurisdiction and right to determine what goes on in your property. Sometimes they get rowdy and rebellious, so you decide it would be good for small children to be separated from their families and put into facilities that you had erected, and in these facilities they would be shown advertisements for your company, particularly advertisements that glorify you as a god and romanticize working for your company and promise good lives if work is done well. They would attend these facilities for about 6 hours a day. But then back to work. Your get old and die, and your son inherits your property. By this time a unique and homogeneous culture has developed thanks to your education facilities conditioning the minds of the young. Your son is widely celebrated among the people, and he feels they can be trusted to be hired as militia, to accompany the pinkertons, who had been getting very old lately. Your son wishes to expand the property even further. Luckily, the company with bordering land was not doing so well- the inhabitants of those lands had overthrown the owners, and of course this was immoral and illegal! Your son feels it is justified to restore order to the land, by force if necessary. So he mobilizes the people of his property, gives them weapons, and sends them off to battle against the neighboring savages. The result is a victory for your son, and so he annexes the lands. The army was happy to fight for their homelend and king (er, CEO). The assimilation process begins, with more facilities being developed in the new lands. Another generation passes, and the kingdom (er, property) is passed down to your grandson, and by this time the inhabitants of the new lands had mostly been assimilated. Unfortunately, the company which had formerly claimed those lands was upset over your company's holding of them, and they were ready to fight your grandson about it. They had also amassed an army over time, and so the war began. The battles stretched for 10 years, with no clear victor in sight. The people of your grandson's property began to become angry, and there was not enough money to be spent on schooling and assimilation, because the GDP had to be totally spent on the war effort, and so the people became increasingly militant and rebellious. Eventually your grandson was usurped by the youngest son of a wealthy family from within the property, who promised the people a better life and an end to wars. This man worked out a peace deal with the other corporation- they would get the lands back. The man's dynasty ruled fairly for a few generations, but skirmishes became more frequent with neighboring landowners once more. Some wars would be won, some would be lost; and eventually rule became more corrupt and exploitative, and the people once again became upset, until there was yet another usurping. This pattern would continue for a thousand years, and the situation for all other lands in the area was the same.

In no way is this post supposed to make me or my parents look like victims. I just need some perspective because I’m really struggling with this. So both my parents are conservatives almost in their 60s. They are both understanding people and have very good hearts. I myself am on the very opposite political spectrum as them. The thing that stresses me out is that they voted for trump. They are not trump supporters they just voted conservative because they always have because the way they grew up or whatever. I’m just so scared that my friends will find out they voted for trump and hate them. Neither of them are really educated about politics at all because they are constantly working and barely have any time to themselves. (I know that’s not an excuse it’s just what I noticed.) If they fully understood the weight of everything they might have voted differently. I know deep down they are good people that care deeply about people. And for some reason I feel guilty for not hating them. Am I a part of the problem for still wanting a good relationship with them? I’ve seen on tik tok some people say “I found out my parents voted for trump and I cut them off” do I need to do the same to be a good person?

Edit: sorry if this post seems stupid I struggle with ocd fears that make me afraid I’m a bad person all the time, and I can get pretty in my head sometimes. so I made this post to hear other perspectives",1627877191.0
"My response to ""Socialism has failed every time its been tried"".",Liberal,9,sexd6o,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sexd6o/my_response_to_socialism_has_failed_every_time/,4," I am pretty sure we have all experienced a conversation at some point in time where someone says, ""Socialism has failed every time it has been tried!' I am also sure that many of you are more educated than myself about socialism and history and have good responses to this kind of objection but I've given it some thought myself and would like to share what I would say. Please feel free to correct me or add your own thoughts so that I may learn!

Firstly, it is not socialism that has failed in places like the USSR, China, North Korea, or Venezuela. Socialism is worker ownership of the means of production. Thats it. You can have socialism without a planned economy or even just government regulation. That would market socialism, where every enterprise is owned and controlled by the workers. Businesses could still turn a profit and they could still fail if they do business badly. This could happen in a democratic country or a dictatorship. Governance isn't the defining factor.

Secondly, what failed in the aforementioned countries was the leaders' ability to create stable, democratic governments following a violent revolution. Here are two examples to illustrate this point: the American Revolution and the French Revolution. The American Revolution was successful in gaining independence for the country and creating a stable government because the colonies were democratic to start. There were democratic institutions before, throughout, and following the revolution. And the citizens were familiar with the democratic process.

As for the French Revolution, well... it was much more revolutionary. Several factors played a part in driving society to the brink. In just a few years, they went from undoing feudalism to overthrowing the king. The years that followed included the reign of terror, in which 16,600 counter-revolutionaries were killed (according to Wikipedia). The Republic lasted only 7 or 8 years before Napoleon entered the scene and things went back to authoritarianism. The revolution was a mess.

The difference here is that all of the countries that have had socialist revolutions tried to do what France tried to do back then. They were oppressed and wanted more for themselves. But they were going from zero to sixty in no time flat and they didn't have democratic institutions to stabilize the process. Things wound up being oppressive again because things were a mess and corrupt leaders took advantage of that. Socialism isn't the problem, governance is.

Again, please let me know if I've made mistakes here or if there is something you would add. I want to learn!",1643394815.0

But the mere existence of that tension/demand/incentive raises ethical and rational questions for me concerning the logical underpinning of anarchocapitalism.  

I can get all wordy with it but over the years arguing with my Ancap friends I have reduced it to a pretty basic scenario/question so here goes-

if you are born into a stateless society and have no land, then you are necessarily reduced to organizing your entire life around gratifying the interests of those who do.  And there is little incentive for them to permit the elevation of your station.  So, why is it not coercion to tell a newborn baby, ""Oh you want water? Get a job.""


*my working out of this conundrum has since caused me to abandon the moral and logical precepts of AC'ism in search of an idea that respects the property of our species' cognitive hardware that recognizes rather instinctively the injustice of dooming babies to servitude and barring their access to territorial resources for their sustenance.

Sweden's state ownership was far more extensive than China's state ownership today (and of course Sweden also had workers co-determination in all enterprises, strong sectoral unions, political democracy, an expansive cooperative sector, wage earner funds, etc). Sweden had state ownership of gas and electricity, railways, airlines, aerospace, shipbuilding, textiles, steel, iron ore, forestry, pharmacies, alcohol retail, pharmacies and pharmaceutical production, chemicals, healthcare services, the post office and more. There was even a state owned hotel and restaurant chain and a large amount of the housing stock was publicly owned.

So for conext: I (22f) recently left an abusive relationship where I was frequently SAed, and it's left me feeling like my only value as a human is sexual and that my body is just an object for horny men to stick their doodles in. 🙄 

I've been given an amazing opportunity for my art to be shown at my first ever exhibition! Yay! I really wanted my art to centre around empowerment and reclamation of my body. So I drew a nude self portrait of me as a fairy. I LOVE the drawing. In it I have huge butterfly wings and im holding a dagger like a bad ass. It makes my body look beautiful and powerful.
I haven't told anyone that the drawing is me. I don't want to tell anyone but a few close friends. 

So, I showed the sketch to my mum and my sister... and both of them made comments about the size of my fairy's tits. I have disproportionately large tits. Real huge knockers. Whatever. I'm used to them being sexualised, that's what got me in this mess to begin with. My mum even said ""don't you want someone to buy ur drawing? Do u think anyones going to want to hang this on their wall?"" 
And then when I told my sister what my mum said, I was like ""it's just a body. It's not like it's porn or anything."" And then my sister was like ""is it not porn?"" 🥲😑😭

I know that if my body was less curvy, if my ass and boobs were smaller, those comments wouldn't have been made. My fairy would just be a beautiful little free spirit and definitely NOT porn. THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS WAS TO SHOW HOW MY BODY ISNT SEXUAL. IT'S ART. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. fufksmsnruf.

I'm scared to put my art into the gallery. I'm scared of what people are going to say about my body, without even realising that it's mine. Am I just re-traumatising myself? Im GOING TO submit my art. I love it and the way it makes me feel. I WANT to say ""fuck anyone who sexualises it"". But it's hard and it's scary... 

I'm hoping for some words of wisdom. Has anyone else made art like this? How did people react and how did you handle it?

The solution to housing unaffordability,Liberal,4,qtccac,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/qtccac/the_solution_to_housing_unaffordability/,2,"As you already know, housing affordability is an issue. It is reaching the point where an entire generation may not be able to afford to rent or buy a home.

The status quo allows a certain group of people to gain wealth off of land. The issue is that land is in fixed supply and is absolutely essential for living and working. As a result, land has a perfectly inelastic supply and a fairly inelastic demand as well. This allows landlords to charge very close to what renters are willing to pay. There are also land speculators who make a profit from buying land and selling at a later date. Just to be clear here, land speculators make this profit without contributing anything to the economy.

Adam Smith is often heralded by conservatives as the one who invented capitalism. He had this to say

&#x200B;

[The quotes that conservatives don't tell are just as interesting as the ones which they do](https://preview.redd.it/ytfffgf8efz71.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0d7cedeed262d532f0c560867ef3f2e3f0380c3)

A major problem is that our tax system doesn't really tax this method of raking in profit without contributing to society. We have taxes on labor (income and payroll tax) and on consumption (sales tax). Neither of these taxes fix the problem because they tax wages rather than wealth. In other words, raising income taxes on the rich really affect the upper middle class the most. Capital gains and estate taxes are a bit better but they don't just tax land, they also tax all wealth, including improvements. If such taxes are too high, they may discourage investment. That's also the issue with property tax which taxes the land but also the improvements made to it. Property tax discourages land speculation but it also discourages more efficient land use since that taxes improvements to land as well as the land itself. In other words, assuming that land value is the same, a parking lot will see a lower property tax than a highrise.

There is such a tax which does tax land profit and it's called a land value tax. The LVT is similar to the property tax in that it taxes stationary property but it only taxes the land rather than anything built on it. It would incentivize more efficient use of land since that wouldn't increase the LVT like a property tax would. Imagine how much a certain property would be worth if it were just dirt, if the LVT were 10%, the landowner would be paying 10% of that every year. Because of this annual fee, land speculation is discouraged. If implemented at the state or federal level, it would also significantly reduce single family zoning because it would incentivize the same people who lobby against new development to reconsider as they pay LVT through the nose.

A land value tax ensures that the value of land is allocated efficiently for the good of society rather than being hoarded by speculators. Depending on how much revenue can be raised from the tax, it can either add to the current tax system or replace every other tax. The revenue can be used to fund basic government services and run a budget surplus or it can be used to fund a basic income.",1636844522.0

Contrast this with what is equivalent to a middle class income not in developing or extremely poor countries, but Greece, turkey, Russia, Bulgaria and the Slovak republic: on average figures are around 10-15K. So around one third or half as much as richer countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, but not even anywhere close to Brazil where middle class means around 7-8K or India where it means less than 3K. If you’re curious, you check out my source right here: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=IDD

A few things to note here: 

1. This is *median* and **not** average income. While averages tend to be skewed by a few outliers (in this case, very rich or very poor people), medians do not suffer the same criticism.
2. This is by *purchasing power parity*, **not** absolute income, and thus accounts for cost of living.

In other words, this is actually a pretty damn accurate measure of your average person’s *actual living standards*. 

Bottom line: *Poverty is all relative*.

Are we really saying that someone who is middle class in Greece, Russia or Turkey is somehow living an extremely shitty life and can’t even function day to day? Of course not. Yet someone who is middle class in Russia is quite literally at the poverty line in Canada. In fact, the person in Canada making the poverty line is actually slightly *better* than our middle class Russian dude.

Now, to be clear, I am not saying that capitalism is some sort of deity or that we don’t need taxes, welfare, unions etc. 

What I am saying is that much of the doomerism in my generation (Gen Z) about how nobody can afford to survive is coming from the right place, but just objectively wrong when it comes to the actual data.

What I am **NOT** saying is that global poverty is not a problem. It absolutely 100% *is*.

Why not anarchism?,Liberal,8,ri1pj5,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/ri1pj5/why_not_anarchism/,25,"Hi,

As I am sure is the case for a lot of you, as I got older I have gone farther and farther leftwards. I grew up in a fairly conservative household and then moved to libertarianism (I know, cringe phase lol), liberalism, social liberalism, social democracy, left social democracy (seeing social democracy as a stepping stone to my ultimate goal: libertarian market socialism).

In my leftward drift I usually have had no real attraction to the dictatorships and authoritarian leftist regimes of the past, USSR, Pol Pot's Cambodia, etc

What has beem more attractive to me is anarchism: the belief that hierarchy ought to be abolished (this includes capitalism and the state).

Anarchy, kinda obviously, doesn't really have a history of authoritarianism (cause again, opposed to the state and power hierarchies). I think many of us are even sympathetic to a lot of anarchist criticisms of capitalism (business buying politicians, etc). 

I outlined personal criticisms in a recent post, but I'd like to hear what you guys think.

Personally I think the biggest problem with anarchism is scalability and dispute resolution mechanisms 

So say we have three communes on a river. Commune A is upstream Commune B which is upstream Commune C. A&B both have factories that pollute the river. Obviously A benefits the most cause their incoming water isn't polluted. B is second hurt and C is the most hurt. Obviously B doesn't like what A is going and complains. A doesn't really have to listen but B threatens to send it's members to sabatoge A's factory (I have seen anarchists propose this is a solution, so I am not making this up). C threatens to do the same to A & B. Now A & B share a common enemy, C. Why wouldn't they team up as C poses a mutual threat (historically this is how alliances actually work, they are not based on if you like your ally but if you hate the same people). Even if every commune had equal resources and population (which would very much not be the case), C is now outnumbered and outgunned. What exactly is it gonna do?

B And A have their differences sure, but that's sorted out after C.


Perhaps some third party arbitrator, commune D could step in to arbitrate. But this isn't really binding, and if they rule against a & b they may comply, but they are still incentived to cheat and undermine the ruling or straight up ignore it. Sure reputations are on the line, but reputational damage is just a cost. Countries and companies do shit like this all the time.  What is C gonna do? Retaliate? Sure, but A & B can just retaliate back no?

See what I am getting at? If you share a common resource you need enforceable rules. And to do that requires some form of authority/central governance. What form that should take is the real discussion no?

So yeah, what do you all think?",1639692924.0

            Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialised skill is 
            rendered worthless by new methods of production.”

Powerful companies, concentrations of wealth, and new methods of production make it increasingly difficult for independent professionals and middle-class merchants to maintain their status.   They end up with the wrong skill set or working for companies that have put their kind out of business.     In other words,  Marx anticipated the Walmartification of capitalist societies.

Marx did not simply dismiss capitalism. He was impressed by it. He argued that it has been the most productive system that the world has seen: 

                 “The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than 
            have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and 
            agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole 
             populations conjured out of the ground — what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the 
            lap of social labour?”

Question about capitalist crisis,Liberal,9,rg38hn,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rg38hn/question_about_capitalist_crisis/,4,"Hi,

So I recently had a post on here about capitalist crisis and I got an interesting response I read:

""
This YouTuber is unaware that Marx rejected under-consumptionist theories of capitalist crisis and that [he never finished his own theory of crisis and capital accumulation](https://mronline.org/2013/12/01/heinrich-answers-critics/).
""

I read through that document and want to check my understanding.

So the argument presented is that Marx assumed a constant surplus value right? This meant that as organic capital increased, the denominator increased and the numerator remained constant, cause the fraction to shrink and thus meaning the rate of profit falls. Right? So this article argues that was flawed because surplus value (the numerator) also changes because of productivity. This means that the numerator and denominator increase and the relative rates determine if profit falls or rises. Is this a correct understanding? Why/why not?

[State capitalism in international context: Varieties and variations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090951620300882)

> We conceptualize state capitalism broadly to capture the three main mechanisms of state intervention in the economy: state ownership, statism, and the degree of threat the governments pose to the private market sphere.

Most reformists who support only social democracy support what the authors define as ""welfare states"": low on ""government threat,"" low on state ownership, and high on what they consider ""statism"" (subsidies, investments, procurements, other indicative planning mechanisms, and regulations).

South Korea is an example of an ""interventionist state"": high on ""government threat,"" low on state ownership, and low on ""statism.""

Singapore, whose government employs over 30% of the workforce, is an example of an ""entrepreneurial state"": low on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and low on ""statism.""

Czechia is an example of the opposite, an ""interventionist welfare state"": high on ""government threat,"" low on state ownership, and high on ""statism.""

Modern Russia is an example of an ""interventionist entrepreneurial state"": high on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and low on ""statism.""  [Unfortunately, as has been argued by Vladislav Inozemtsev, Lenin's New Economic Policy was also low on ""statism.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/piowoj/lenins_new_economic_policy_and_the_russian/)

According to the paper, there is no modern state that has been low on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and high on ""statism.""  No modern state has been an ""entrepreneurial welfare state"" (""entrepreneurial"" in the sense that government competes for business opportunities and assets).

I disagree.  The PRC definitely has subsidies, investments, procurements, other indicative planning mechanisms, and regulations. It is much higher on ""statism"" that what the paper suggests. However, from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao, the economy has been low on ""government threat.""

On the other hand, Greece is high on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and high on ""statism"": an ""interventionist entrepreneurial welfare state.""

What strikes me, in this section, is how many ""moderate"" conservatives, in many countries, were willing to work with the Nazis. 

Fascism needs help from moderates. It is the attitude of those in the center who determine whether fascism can thrive. In some eras the moderates are unified against fascism, and in those eras fascism will remain asleep. But when the moderates favor cooperation with fascism, then fascism will tend to grow. During the 1930s, it was noteworthy how many moderate conservatives were willing to work with Nazi Germany. This was international – in Norway and Sweden and Belgium and the Netherlands there was a thick network of fascists helping the Nazis, and the moderate conservatives, where they were in power, were perfectly content to let this happen. Brandt’s story offers dozens of examples of how much the Nazis gained power because of help from right-of-center governments that were not nominally fascist.

Comparing Covid lockdowns To Laws Against Drink Driving Is A False Equivalency,Conservative,0,sygvna,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sygvna/comparing_covid_lockdowns_to_laws_against_drink/,13,"1: Laws against drink driving do no violate established civil liberties. They do not impact freedom of expression, freedom of movement, the right to a speedy trial, the right to be free from searches without a warrant or the right to work. The same can't be said about lockdowns.

2: Laws against drink driving are limited in scope. They only require somebody to refrain from drink driving. Lockdowns impact most if not all aspects of a person's life. They impact the person both socially and economically and in so many other ways.

3: Laws against drink driving do not cause harm. Although not being able to drive home while drunk may be annoying, the benefits of not driving home drunk absolutely outweigh downsides. Lockdowns cause widespread harm to society including social, psychological and economic harm. This harm disproportionately harms the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of society.

4: Laws against drink driving achieve their intended purpose. Laws against drink driving do in fact save lives and are supported by science. Lockdowns save little to no lives and are not backed by science. Every pandemic plan prior to covid-19 opposed lockdowns and current studies are showing that they have slim to none impact on saving lives from covid-19.

5: It is more difficult to use laws against drink driving as a political weapon. Lockdown rules can easily be used to target and shut down political groups and movements. This is seen in both third world countries and in western countries as well. For example, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews shutting down the entire construction industry to punish them for a protest and the Chinese government using covid restrictions to restrict the travel of political dissidents.

6: Laws against drink driving are proportional to the threat of drunk drivers and there doesn't seem to be any viable alternatives to laws against drink drivers. Lockdowns are disproportionate to the threat of covid-19. Although covid-19 can make people from some demographics very sick, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the average person. We also have some vaccines that can reduce the severity of the disease. Focused protection is not just a viable alternative to lockdowns, it also saves lives unlike lockdowns.",1645512527.0

A striking case in point is given by the late Stephen Jay Gould in his book The Mismeasure of Man. He recounts the story of American physician Samuel George Morton, who had collected some 600 skulls representing populations on the continents of North and South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Morton measured the cranial volume of the skulls (a good measure of the brain size of the person when alive) and published his results, including the original data. Just as Morton would have expected, Anglo-Saxons had the highest average (92 cubic inches), followed by Asians in the middle and blacks on the bottom (83 cu in). When Gould re-analyzed Morton’s data he found biases built into the specimens used for each racial group. For example, the aboriginal sample was heavily represented by skulls from Peruvian people who are short. Similarly, the black sample included proportionally more women than the Caucasian. Smaller bodies means smaller brain mass—it has nothing to do with intelligence, and should have been corrected (but wasn’t). As Gould noted, this was done “without conscious motivation; expectation is a powerful guide to action.”

In medicine today, researchers use the double-blind randomized clinical trial to eliminate such subjective biases from influencing the results. Double-blind means that both the study subjects and those providing the treatment do not know whether any particular patient is receiving the actual medicine or a sham control. Blinding the patients by randomization helps correct for the placebo effect—people want to be cured or get some relief from illness or pain and will respond just to the soothing voice of a caregiver or to a sugar pill (especially if brightly colored!). Blinding the caregiver prevents unconscious cues being given to the patient that would allow the latter to guess that they are receiving real treatment rather than the control.

Medical Quackery

It is true that what is now called science-based medicine is rather a recent innovation. Voltaire is credited with the aphorism, “Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of which they know nothing.” In 1891, the writer and physician Oliver Wendell Holmes acidly noted that if most of the drugs then in use were loaded on a ship and if it “could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes.”

Times do change, and procedures such as MRI or CT scans which are routine today would have seemed like science fiction a generation or two ago. As advances have been made in physics and chemistry, and especially molecular biology, they have dramatically affected the practice of medicine. Yet the popularity of “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) is great and rising. Many people can’t afford regular medical care, and patients will grasp at anything that promises a cure. I.e., CAM is a social problem.

What is alternative medicine? There are lots of definitions, but at bottom it is the same division that separates science from non-science. Real medicine is based on substances or procedures whose efficacy can be explained by purely natural causes. All the rest depends on something non-physical, be it divine intervention (prayer healing) or the invocation of some mysterious “energy” or “life force” outside the laws of physics. Medicine is real and the rest is faith-based, not unlike religion, though at times without the guy in the sky.

Buzzwords like “energy” and “life force,” which are at the heart of all alternative medicine nostrums, are really nothing but a cover for the idea of “vitalism”—i.e., that there is something unique about living systems. This was scientific mainstream until the 1820s when German chemist Friedrich Wöhler accidentally synthesized urea from inorganic compounds. This was the first time a molecule previously only obtained from living organisms had been created in the laboratory, and it marked the birth of organic chemistry. Actually the division of chemistry into organic and inorganic is itself a vestige of the vitalist era. The laws governing chemical reactions are the same.

Edzard Ernst, an MD and also practitioner of CAM, and Simon Singh, a British science journalist, have written a useful book, Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine. If anything the authors bend over backwards to give CAM the widest latitude to show proof of some shred of benefit beyond the placebo effect. And what is the conclusion? Acupuncture and homeopathy: useless; chiropractic: maybe you could try it but only for lower back pain, though a physical therapist would be just as good, and cheaper; herbal medicines: a few have a mildly positive effect, but in most cases conventional drugs work as well or better.

So why is CAM still around? Here are 33.9 billion reasons: that is the number of dollars Americans spent out-of-pocket on alternative medicines in 2007, according to the National Institute of Health’s alternative medicine center. This does not even include charges to insurance. Out of that, about $15 billion went for supplements—that’s about one third of the out-of-pocket expenses for real prescription drugs. One possible reason is the odd belief that nature is this kind, gentle, holistic entity that has only your best interests at heart. This shows a profound ignorance of the natural world. I would suggest that those so believing pick up a good book on human parasitology, preferably with good color pictures!

Chiropractic Pseudoscience

I’ll pick on chiropractic. These guys not only fleece you but can cause great damage in the process. Chiropractic started in the 1890s when one Daniel David Palmer came up with the idea that diseases were caused by misalignments of the vertebrae that interfered with the flow of “innate intelligence” from the nervous system to the organs. These disruptions were called subluxations. Was this on the basis of systematic investigations of any kind? No. Palmer’s epiphany came one day when he claimed to have cured a person with hearing problems by adjusting his spine. One slight problem is that the cranial nerves controlling hearing and balance go directly from the lower brain to the middle ear—they do not emanate from the spinal cord at all. As for the “innate intelligence,” not a shred of physical proof has ever been given for its existence.

Chiropractors perform what they call manipulation to cure the subluxations in the vertebral column. This is a rapid acceleration thrust on the bone which moves it just past the point where muscles could conceivably move it on their own, but short of bone and tissue damage. Well, that’s the theory. For my book, it sounds more like what happens to your spine in an automobile accident. When applied to the cervical vertebrae—the seven vertebrae of the spinal column in your neck—the results can be vertebral arterial dissection. This can obstruct blood flow to the brain or throw a clot that leads to a stroke.

Chiropractors, like all purveyors of “alternative medicine,” like to portray themselves as little Davids struggling against the Goliaths of Big Pharma and the American Medical Association. But chiropractors pull in almost $4 billion a year—it’s a business, just like Big Pharma. Chiropractor Web sites are full of handy tips on “practice building”—roping in more patients, preferably for weekly or biweekly office visits. Even if you are well, they want you to get an adjustment—like a tune-up, I guess. Even cars only need an oil change every 6,000 miles, not every week!

Religious Obscurantism

Now we come to the granddaddy of all quackery: religion. I’m going to concentrate on the Christian fundamentalists, in particular the very political anti-science, anti-evolution movement now masquerading as Intelligent Design (ID). All three of the so-called Abrahamic faiths share a common creation myth. God created everything, and all the animals and plants have come from that creation pretty much unchanged. Some of the anti-evolution types allow for a bit of change within a species, but no speciation. So, it was no surprise that Darwin’s book was met with such hostility by the believers of theism: God was removed as the causative agent for the wonderful variety of living things, and man was an animal like the rest and descended from primate ancestors. And what the yahoos couldn’t stomach at all was Darwin’s speculation—now backed by overwhelming evidence—that the human ancestor had come out of Africa.

Intelligent Design is a relatively recent sprout on the Christian bush. Actually, it is an example of rapid speciation into a new environment. Prior to 1987, the creationists were touting “creation science” and demanding that it be taught in the public schools alongside evolution. That got shot down by a series of court decisions, starting with an Arkansas case in 1982, and then in the Supreme Court in 1987. So rather quickly—no evolution here!—“creation science” transformed itself into “intelligent design.”

Intelligent Design pretends that it is scientific, but its basic premises are very wrong and it is important to see why. Premise one is “irreducible complexity”—there exist things in nature like the eye, or with a nod to nanotech, cellular assemblages such as the bacterial flagellar motor. According to ID, such things have to be taken as a whole, with every part essential to function—remove one piece and it is non-functional. Supposedly there is no step-by-step way of building these structures, i.e., no Darwinian method. Since they are so complex, they couldn’t have come about by chance and therefore had to have been created by a Designer. They’re careful not to say God, but it’s pretty clear they are not referring to the Tooth Fairy.

In the Origin of Species, Darwin anticipated such problems, including the example of the vertebrate eye, and the creationists love to quote his sentence: “To suppose that the eye…could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.” But they never mention his answer in the very next sentence of the passage: “If any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.” Think about it: would you rather have blurred vision, or be totally blind? Even an imperfect eye gives an organism a selective advantage compared with no sight at all.

The second premise is the Anthropic Principle. There is such vastness to the universe. There is the beautiful, intricate motion of the planets around the Sun, moons around the planets, of the stars and the galaxies—they now agree with Copernicus and Galileo—and here is Earth, just right for living things to exist on. If the Earth were closer to the Sun it would be too hot—look at Venus. Further away and it would be too cold. It looks like the whole universe was created or fine-tuned with human life in mind, so to speak. Hence, there must have been a Creator. Sir John Polkinghorne, a respected British physicist and also a Christian minister, stated: “The fundamental parameters of the universe are such as to permit the creation of observers within it.”

Sounds profound, right? But physicist Robert L. Park translated Polkinghorne into something less pretentious, more along the lines of what Yogi Berra might have said: “If things were different, things would not be the way things are.” There is another amusing argument put forward by the late author Douglas Adams, who, among other things, wrote the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and was a script editor for the famous British series Doctor Who in 1979. He compared the Anthropic Principle to a “puddle waking up one morning and thinking, ‘This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn’t it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!’”

Of course the whole geological record shows that the Earth is much older than 6,000 years, and that thousands of species have come and gone over the ages. Creationists used to wail on about the lack of transitional forms for whales—how could a terrestrial mammal smoothly evolve into one now at home only in the oceans? Well, in the last 15 or so years, a whole string of fossils have been discovered showing in beautiful detail all those “missing forms.” In any case, the creationists aren’t about to let facts get in the way. Henry Morris, founder of the modern creationist movement, stated: “No geological difficulties, real or imagined, can be allowed to take precedence over the clear statements and necessary inferences of Scripture.”

While the creationists may seem fringe oddballs (comedian Lewis Black described them as the people who are “watching The Flintstones as if it were a documentary”), they are very political and they have supporters with deep pockets. In 1998, the Discovery Institute, a major think tank for creationism/ID, produced an internal memo called the “Wedge Document.” It was called that because they considered their attack on Darwin and evolution as the “thin edge of the wedge” for their broader “Governing Goals”: “to defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies” and “to replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.”

Science and Communist Liberation

Human evolution happened in such a way that no hominid ancestor survived; it could have been otherwise but wasn’t. All humans are genetically members of the same species and there is no biological basis for the separation into races. It should be noted that Darwin was a staunch abolitionist, and during the U.S. Civil War hoped that the North would put emancipation on its banner and eliminate slavery no matter the cost in blood. As we wrote in “Hail Charles Darwin!” (WV No. 854, 16 September 2005):

“America’s other peculiarity among advanced capitalist countries is its deeply religious character. Nowhere else—not even in Italy where the Vatican still heavily influences civil society—is there such refractory religiosity and visceral hostility to the long-established facts of Darwinian natural selection as the motor force of evolution. Why? The absence of even a mass reformist workers party that expresses in even a blurry way that working people have needs and interests counterposed to those of their exploiters is a large part of the explanation for political backwardness in the U.S. But like everything else in this country, it also boils down to the central intersection of race and class. Religion in the U.S. supplies an ideology that can seemingly harmonize conflicting class interests while keeping this society with two races firmly ordered: capital above labor and white above black.”

Liberals worry about the denigration of science and rationalism—how is the country to maintain a competitive position in the world if the next generation knows more about the Book of Numbers than about algebra? Marxists are materialists and take it as a given that science and religion are incompatible.

Here we come to the fundamental difference between Marxists and liberals. At bottom, liberals accept the existence of the capitalist order and their most radical demand is for reforms. Their high point was the French Revolution—liberty, fraternity, equality. All abstract ideals, behind which lurk the sanctity of private property and the class rule of the bourgeoisie. Liberals, it is true, will recognize the class struggle, but what they reject is that the proletariat should actually seize state power from the bourgeoisie.

The “liberty” so beloved by a capitalist is his liberty to make a profit, which necessarily comes through the exploitation of the workers he employs. Such exploitation is built into the capitalist system, a system that is at bottom irrational. Economic competition inevitably leads to military competition, and imperialist war. Imperialism can’t be reformed—the whole system of private property has to be overthrown. The goal of the Marxists is the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which on a global scale can lay the basis for a classless communist society.

Science can open up as yet undreamt possibilities for humanity. But under capitalism today, vast resources devoted to research are for military purposes. The American ruling class was the first to own and so far the only one to use nuclear weapons, and the warheads in the U.S. arsenal are now each 20 or more times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Even a “limited” nuclear war could have catastrophic consequences, beyond the initial effects of the explosions. Climactic changes could wreak havoc on key agricultural areas, putting the survival of the human species at risk.

The imperialists have to be removed from power and disarmed by the workers before the rulers kill us all. That will require building a revolutionary workers party, independent of all the parties of capital, including the Democrats. Obama has continued to carry on all the essential policies of the administrations before him. That is actually why the bourgeoisie put him in power. The whole racist, murderous edifice of American imperialism has to be smashed by the multiracial working class, organized into democratically elected councils and led by its Leninist-Trotskyist vanguard party.

As this talk has been in defense of Marxism and science, it is worth noting Marx’s words at the end of the preface to the first German edition of Capital: “The present society is no solid crystal, but an organism capable of change, and is constantly changing.” This dialectical mode of thought inspired Lenin, Trotsky and the whole Bolshevik Party that made the October Revolution in Russia in 1917. It remained a cornerstone of Trotsky’s thinking until the day he died.

In The Prophet Unarmed (1959) Marxist historian Isaac Deutscher cites a revealing sample of Trotsky’s vision of a future society, after capitalism’s demise: “The drudgery of feeding and bringing up children…will be lifted from the individual family by social initiative…. Woman will at last emerge from semi-slavery…. Socio-educational experiments…will evolve with a now inconceivable elan. The communist way of life will not grow up blindly like coral reefs in the sea. It will be built consciously. It will be checked by critical thought. It will be directed and corrected…. No sooner will one crust begin to form itself on the human existence than it will burst under the pressure of new inventions and achievements.”

The men and women of the future will no longer need religion, what Marx described as solace, the “opium of the people.” And the key to unlock human potential will be science, not superstition.

Words to remind us of our mission,Liberal,40,se7oyx,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/se7oyx/words_to_remind_us_of_our_mission/,7,"Fellow comrades, colleagues and friends

today the results of the poll have been published and from this position I may thank you all for your vote and candidacies. It shows how invested people are and that we care.

I concur with this result and will humbly accept the award, that you gave your vote for - therefore I'd like to personally say my thanks to you all. For the trust you give me and the insight into a lot of things. I will take the prize - but I won't accept the personalised community flair. Instead, if the mods will allow it, I'd like to hand in my option for a personalised flair and exchange it for a general flair. I would like to recommend some options.

Adding to that, I'd like to congratulate u/virbrevis to his victory as well as you all - apparently we all won due to a good joke :D

Let me assert my belief in the job and good work of this particular subreddit. Although I ain't a long-serving member of this sub (barely nine months), it was not only a good thing to see/meet like-minded people from all over the world, but to gain a better understandning of a lot of topics.

As most of you are aware, most of my effortposts are about historical matters stemming from my studies at university. But one thing that I learned in this sub as well as my activities in elections and daily party life showed me more to the movement than is ideology. While ideology is a necessary groundstone for the daily work and enthusiasm of our movement, Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism always defined itself as a synthesis of ideology and pragmatism.

As someone that is quite invested in the work of Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism, I would like to say the following:

*While our way will never be an easy one, while we might face great hurdles along this way, we will go our way. While it is a stony one, we will always go it. While personal matters strike us down or weaken us, when we are unhappy with ourselves and the world, we are weak from hard work - we will still stand up. While tragedy might strike us, while things might look bleak and the situation unnerving, all options gone - we will go our way.*

*With sunlight, knowledge and passion - the greatest assets humankind has ever posessed - we will go our way. On it we shall never stop or hold for just a second - instead we shall continuously walk it. Let us be a unified group of people, that care for the same things and fight for the betterment of humanity and a better future. While we may differ in the smaller things, let us be united in the greater common cause of things - a line that shall not only connect us, but let us become brothers and sisters. To not be blinded by personal greed, instead working for the greater cause of society and humanity in all fields of life.*

*In rememberance to all the great idols of the movement that shared not only their minds, but their whole lives for the cause of a better world, let us carry their ideals like a flag forwards on the way we are walking. And let their ideas be the torches that will light the darkness that is the future, the unknown land. For we shall not fear of change, not be afraid of the future - as we will continue our way with peace of mind and without fear. Let us be the first line of attack for a better future for all, leaving no one behind - at the same time, let us not forget about those that have perished on the way, as we are deeply and eternally thankful for their deeds, help and service.*

*With these tools, my dear friends, I don't fear the future - on the contrary. Together I believe we shall persevere the darkness and walk into a bright future. On this spot I'll guarantee you that I will always be on your side, to give my full strength and mind to this cause - as it is the greatest cause of humankind. So let us walk this way together, united all over the world with the cries of millions, the torches and flags - shouting our eternal slogan: Democracy - Liberty, Justice, Solidarity forever!*

He rejected Fascism and Communism and the experiments that had run rampant during his youth -- that much seems like a positive thing. But here he went so far as to avoid hard thinking about what institutions would need to exist for the EU to be fully functional and healthy. 

I've mentioned before that I'm dumping my research notes onto my Substack. Today I write a bit about how this avoidance of ""institutional perfection"" morphed into an unwillingness to do any hard thinking about what institutions were necessary to ensure the success of democracy at the pan-European level:

In the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, [Singapore](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/singapore) ranks as the second most “economically free” country in the world just behind Hong Kong. Since many use this index as a shorthand for “most capitalist” countries, a lot of prominent people end up saying some really weird things about Singapore. For instance, in his Liberty Con remarks, Bryan Caplan claimed Singapore was one of the closest countries to the capitalist ideal.

It is true of course that Singapore has a market economy. But it’s also true that, in Singapore, the state owns a huge amount of the means of production. In fact, depending on how you count it, the Singaporean government probably owns more capital than any other developed country in the world after Norway.

The Singaporean state [owns](https://books.google.com/books?id=UC2wCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=singapore+state+owns+land&source=bl&ots=iUqL7GyZTd&sig=fmeD-Q-5txks2RNalyglYEMxCl0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE5oydut7ZAhWSVt8KHYtwDhU4ChDoAQhDMAU#v=onepage&q=singapore%20state%20owns%20land&f=false) 90 percent of the country’s land. Remarkably, this level of ownership was not present from the beginning. In 1949, the state owned just 31 percent of the country’s land. It got up to 90 percent land ownership through [decades of forced sales](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/1f669eff-bc82-49d1-a27c-2624e4cab8c6), or what people in the US call eminent domain.

The Singaporean state does not merely own the land. They directly develop it, especially for residential purposes. Over 80 percent of Singapore’s population [lives in](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us) housing constructed by the country’s public housing agency HDB. The Singaporean government claims that around 90 percent of people living in HDB units “own” their home. But the way it really works is that, when a new HDB unit is built, the government [sells](https://www.gov.sg/factually/content/do-hdb-flat-buyers-own-their-flat) a transferable 99-year lease for it. The value of that lease slowly declines as it approaches the 99-year mark, after which point the lease expires and possession of the HDB unit reverts back to the state. Thus, Singapore is a land where almost everyone is a long-term public housing tenant.

Then there are the state-owned enterprises, which they euphemistically call Government-linked Companies (GLCs). Through its sovereign wealth fund Temasek, the Singaporean government [owns](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/Portals/0/docs/FinalReport_SOE_1July2014.pdf) a large share (20% or more) of 20 companies (2012 figure). Together these companies make up 37% of the market capitalization of the Singaporean stock market. The state also owns a large share of 8 real estate investment trust (REIT) companies (2012 figure), which they call GLREITs. The value of the GLREITs make up 54% of the country’s total REIT market.

The sovereign wealth fund Temasek doesn’t just own domestic assets. It also is invested broadly throughout the world, especially in other Asian countries. In March of last year, Temasek [had](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/our-financials/portfolio-performance.html) a net portfolio value of S$275 billion, which is equal to around 62% of the [country’s annual GDP](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/browse-by-theme/national-accounts). To put this figure in more familiar terms, Temasek’s total holdings are equivalent to if the US government built a $12.4 trillion wealth fund.

Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t generally associate state ownership of the means of production with capitalism. One way to see whether libertarians or conservatives actually think Singapore’s system is uber-capitalistic is to imagine how they would respond to someone who ran a campaign in the US aimed at bringing the country up to the Singaporean ideal.

In this campaign, the candidate would say that the state should expropriate nearly all of the land in the country, build virtually all of the housing in the country, move almost everyone into public housing leaseholds, become the largest shareholder of more than a third of the country’s publicly-traded companies (weighted by market capitalization), and build out a sovereign wealth fund that holds tens of trillions of dollars of corporate assets. Would this campaign meet with a warm libertarian embrace or perhaps be derided as a bit socialistic?

The case of Singapore is more than just a funny gotcha to use against right-wingers. It actually raises an interesting question about what it is people care about when it comes to “capitalism” and “socialism.” Is capitalism primarily about markets or private ownership? Relatedly, is socialism primarily about ending markets or promoting collective ownership? Often these things are bundled together, but they are logically and practically separable. Singapore (and Norway, among others) shows that it is quite possible to collectively own the means of production while also using price systems to assist in the allocation of productive factors. This is what market socialists have been saying for a hundred years.

Welfare economists elucidates the problem with a 2D graph where the x axis measures A's utility, u1, while the Y axis B's, u2. The distribution problem is to find some point on the line joining A's and B's utility. In this particular example, this line can be mathematically expressed as

u1+2u2 =200

Welfare economist's suggestion is to make the two utilities  equal, i.e.,


u1 =u2 .

Down through the years one of the most persistent attacks on Karl Marx by the high priests of bourgeois economics--the ideological guardians of the profit system--has been his contention that, in the final analysis, capitalism depends on the impoverishment of the working class.

History, they maintain, has proven otherwise and refuted Marx. While there have been periods of crisis, and rapid and even prolonged falls in the living standards of the masses, in the long run the profit system has served to uplift them and will continue to do so into the indefinite future, whatever fluctuations it may undergo.

Moreover, there is no possible alternative because the market system is not a historically developed mode of production, which came into being at one point and is therefore destined to pass away like earlier modes of production before it, slavery and feudalism. Rather, it is rooted in the laws of nature itself and is necessary and therefore eternal. In other words, despite some imperfections, which may give rise to problems at certain points, all is really for the best in the best of all possible worlds.

In feudal times, the high priests of the Church, who played the key role in sustaining and sanctifying the ruling classes of their day, maintained that when crises arose this was not a product of the social system but an ""act of God,"" a punishment for the sins of man deriving from his fall.

While there have been enormous advances in social and political thought since then--a product of the Enlightenment and the vast advances in the scientific understanding--the modus operandi of the present day ""high priests"" of capitalist economy, the bourgeois economists and pundits, is not altogether different from their predecessors.

When confronted with economic crises and their persistence, they maintain that these are not a product of the inexorable workings of the capitalist system itself, but arise from ""market imperfections"" or some external, unforeseen or accidental event. That is, they proceed, as Marx put it, on the basis that so long as capitalism acts according to the textbooks--the modern day scriptures used to justify the present socio-economic order--crises are not endemic to the system.

The events of the past two weeks, with the largest fall in markets since the crisis of 2008, raising the spectre of an even bigger disaster than that of a decade ago, have provided a damning exposure of this entire ideological framework.

Before going into a deeper analysis of the underlying driving forces and the inherent and irresolvable contradictions of which these events are an expression, let us begin with one undeniable economic fact.

In the decade since the eruption of the global financial crisis of 2008, none of the underlying contradictions that exploded to the surface has been resolved. At the same time, the immediate and ongoing consequences of the breakdown have been the reduction of the living standards of billions of people, while creating unprecedented wealth for a capitalist oligarchy occupying the heights of society. Or as Marx put it, the accumulation of wealth at one pole, amid poverty, misery and degradation at the other.

Whatever the immediate outcome, the financial turmoil of the past days has established, as an undeniable reality, the continuing threat of a meltdown of the capitalist economy. It hangs like a sword of Damocles over the working masses of the world, destined to fall, if not in this crisis, then in others to come.

Moreover, one of the most striking features of the latest crisis, is that it was not sparked by the immediate threat of recession but by news that economic growth was enjoying an uptick--the best period of synchronised global growth since 2009, according to the International Monetary Fund. Most significantly, it was triggered by data showing that wages in the US experienced their largest annual rise since 2009.

Most of what passed for analysis in the bourgeois media did little better than the tweet forthcoming from the very limited intelligence of US President Donald Trump. He noted: ""In the 'old days,' when good news was reported the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake and we have so much good (great) news about the economy!""

Trump's ""analysis"" omitted a central feature of the market rise over the past nine years. It has not taken place on the basis of ""good news"" but in a period of the lowest growth in any ""recovery"" in the post-World War II period. It has been sustained only by the continued inflow of ultra-cheap money from the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks.

Lawrence Summers, former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and now Harvard professor of economics, was slightly more insightful. ""This is not yet a major earthquake,"" he wrote. ""Whether it's an early tremor or a random fluctuation remains to be seen. I'm nervous and will stay nervous. [It is] far from clear that good growth and stable finance are compatible.""

Summers is at least vaguely aware that in the present situation there is something deeply troubling for the capitalist class for which he speaks. The very measures undertaken in response to the last crisis, supposedly aimed at restoring economic health and growth, may in fact have created the conditions for another financial disaster as growth begins to rise.

The tendency of the rate of profit to fall

To analyse the present situation, it is necessary to leave the sphere of bourgeois economics--based on the premise that there are no inherent and objective contradictions in the profit system--and probe its historical development on the basis of the laws of motion of the capitalist economy uncovered by Marx.

The ongoing turmoil in financial markets, beginning with the Wall Street crash of October 1987, must be analysed on the basis of one of the most important contradictions of the capitalist economy explained by Marx. That is the long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

This tendency was noted by the foremost representatives of English classical political economy--Adam Smith and David Ricardo--who preceded Marx in the period when the bourgeoisie was a rising and progressive class.

While Smith and Ricardo found the tendency of the rate of profit to fall deeply disturbing, especially the latter because of its implications for the long-term future of the capitalist economy, they were unable to give any scientific explanation for it. That was provided by Marx, beginning with his uncovering of the secret of surplus value.

While Smith and Ricardo had the notion that the origin of surplus value was the labour of the developing working class, its actual source always remained a mystery to Marx's predecessors. How was it possible, they cudgelled their brains, on the basis of the laws of commodity exchange in the market, where equivalents exchange for equivalents, for a surplus to arise and for this surplus to be appropriated by capital?

Marx's solution consisted in his probing of the most important commodity exchange in capitalist economy, that between capital and labour. He showed that the commodity which the worker sold to the capitalist was not, as had been previously maintained, his or her labour, but labour power, the capacity to work.

Like every other commodity in the market, labour power's value was determined by the value of the commodities needed to reproduce it--in this case, the value of the commodities needed to sustain the individual worker and his or her family to ensure the continued supply of wage workers.

Surplus value arose from the difference between the value created by the worker in the course of the working day through the production process, and the value of the commodity, labour power, that the worker sold to capital through the wage contract.

The raw materials and machinery used up in the production process did not add new value, but passed on to the final product the value they already embodied.

Yet the analysis was not yet complete. The rate of profit had to be explained. This rate was not determined at the level of the individual capitalist firm, but at the level of the capitalist economy as a whole. It was given by the ratio of the total surplus value extracted from the working class to the total capital outlaid--the expenditure on labour power plus the expenditure on the means of production, raw materials and machinery.

The tendency of the rate of profit to fall arose not from some external factor, Marx showed, but from a contradiction at the very heart of this process.

The development of capitalist production led to the expansion of the productive forces and the use of ever-larger amounts of raw materials and machinery in the production process. As a result, expenditure on materials and machinery tended to comprise an increasing proportion of the total capital laid out. But this increased expenditure on what Marx called constant capital, as opposed to the expenditure on labour power, or variable capital, did not give rise to additional or surplus value.

Because the rate of profit was determined by the ratio of total surplus value to the total mass of capital--constant and variable--employed, there was an inherent tendency for it to decline.

Now, as Marx clearly identified, there were countervailing factors. These included: the increased exploitation of the working class in order to widen the difference between the value of labour power and the value created by the worker in the course of the working day; the lowering of wages to below the value of labour power, enforced through the creation of unemployment and a surplus working population; the cheapening of the costs of raw materials and machinery, so reducing the total value of capital on which the rate of profit was calculated; and the expansion of foreign trade.

But while these countervailing factors lessened the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, and at times could operate very powerfully--even lifting the profit rate--the basic tendency continually reasserted itself.

Marx characterised the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the most important law of political economy, above all from an historical point of view. This was because, on the one hand, it drove capital to develop the productive forces in an attempt to overcome its effects, while, on the other, it was the source of the continually recurring crises that beset the capitalist mode of production.

Marx's critics and the end of the post-war boom

With the development of the post-war capitalist boom, extending from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, Marx's law, it was claimed, had been refuted by historical events. As had been seen in the case of the German revisionist Eduard Bernstein at the end of the 19th century, the attack on Marx's analysis came from those who claimed to be his followers, but insisted it needed to be revised and updated.

The assault on Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall was at the centre of one of the most influential books of the late 1960s, Monopoly Capital, written by the ""independent"" Marxist economist Paul Sweezy in co-authorship with Paul Baran in the midst of the post-war boom.

Sweezy, the founder of the journal Monthly Review, had already cast considerable doubt on the validity of Marx's law in his first book, The Theory of Capitalist Development, published in 1941. He now maintained that Marx had developed the law under conditions of competition in the 19th century and that in 20th century monopoly capitalism it no longer applied, if it ever had.

Sweezy maintained that the key question confronting capital was not the insufficient extraction of surplus value relative to the ever-growing mass of capital--the issue to which Marx's law had pointed--but the reverse. Monopoly capital created an increased mass of surplus value that had to be continually ""absorbed.""

A key aspect of Sweezy's theory, flowing directly from his economic analysis, was that in the advanced capitalist countries, dominated by monopolies, the working class was no longer a revolutionary force. The vehicle for socialist revolution, he claimed, was now the masses in the so-called Third World countries, striving for national liberation.

Monopoly Capital is no longer widely read but it continues to exert an influence. David Harvey, for example, adheres to much of Sweezy's economic analysis, as well as his insistence on the non-revolutionary role of the working class.

However, as so often happens, Sweezy's ""refutation"" of Marx came right at the point when developments in the capitalist economy were confirming Marx's scientific insights. Earlier, Bernstein had maintained that the Marxist analysis of the inevitable breakdown of capitalism was rendered a fiction by the boom beginning in the late 1890s. The collapse of Bernstein's prognosis came just 14 years after its elaboration, with the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

In Sweezy's case, his refutation was almost instantaneous. The publication of Monopoly Capital in 1966 came at a point when profit rates in the advanced capitalist economies were starting to turn down. This led to mounting economic problems and the rise of class tensions that were soon to produce potentially revolutionary struggles by the working class from 1968 to 1975.

Starting with the May-June 1968 general strike in France, the largest and most extended in history, and including the 1969 hot autumn in Italy, the 1974 miners' strike that brought down the Tory government in Britain, the revolutionary situation in Chile (1970-73) and the upheavals in the US, to name just some of the events, world capitalism was shaken to its foundations.

With the direct collaboration of the Stalinist, social democratic and trade union apparatuses, which betrayed these struggles, the capitalist classes were able to bring the situation under control and maintain their rule.

However, the underlying economic problems of the US and other major capitalist economies, rooted in declining profit rates, remained. Having kept themselves in the saddle, the ruling classes undertook a massive offensive against the working class, coupled with restructuring the world economy.

The global counter-offensive was initiated in the US under Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, who put in place a high-interest rate regime. Its purpose was two-fold: to wipe out unprofitable sections of industry and force a major industrial restructure, and eliminate the large industrial complexes that were the centres of militant working class struggles in an earlier period. The Volcker purge had vast global ramifications, leading in 1982-83 to the most serious global recession since the Great Depression.

The decade of the 1980s was characterised by major class battles, of which the mass sacking of US air traffic controllers in 1981 by Reagan and the state violence unleashed by the Thatcher Tory government against the British miners' strike in 1984-85 were two of the most prominent. The decade also saw a fundamental transformation in the role of the trade unions. From organisations that had fought for limited gains by the working class, they betrayed all of its struggles as they became the chief enforcers of the program of pro-market, capitalist restructuring.

The attack on the social position of the working class--aimed at increasing the extraction of surplus value to counter the fall in the rate of profit--was accompanied by a reorganisation of production, through downsizing and globalisation to take advantage of cheaper sources of labour.

The growth of financial speculation

Crucial to this restructuring was the freeing of financial capital from the restrictions and regulations that were set in place following the disastrous experiences of the 1930s. The growing operations of finance, through the issuing of so-called junk bonds and other measures, were central to hostile takeovers, downsizing and mergers and acquisitions that transformed the organisation of capitalist production.

At the same time, the pressure on profit rates, as Marx predicted, resulted in a turn by capital to operations in the financial markets and speculative ventures as a means of profit accumulation.

This process led to financial storms by the end of the 1980s, with the eruption of the savings and loans debacle and the October 1987 share market crash, in which the Dow plunged by more than 22 percent in a single day.

The response of the incoming Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, represented a major turning point. He committed the central bank to the provision of liquidity to the financial markets in what became known as the ""Greenspan put."" In effect, the Fed became the guarantor to the financial markets, reversing previous policy.

While the October 1987 crash was the most severe one-day fall in history--a position it retains to this day--it did not lead to a broader crisis in the economy as a whole.

This was because the onslaught against the working class in the US and the first wave of globalisation, marked by the transfer of large areas of industrial production to the cheaper-labour countries of East Asia, the ""Asian Tigers,"" was beginning to lift the rate of profit.

This was reinforced after 1991 with the liquidation of the Soviet Union and the consequent abandonment by countries such as India of their nationally-regulated development programs and the increasing turn to the free market.

China, which became a source of cheap labour production in the 1980s through the establishment of special economic zones, opened up still further. The Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 was the signal by the Chinese Communist Party regime that it stood ready, by whatever means necessary, to ensure the exploitation of the Chinese working class by global capital.

In the first period of the Clinton presidency, beginning in 1993, the US economy enjoyed rising profit rates as a result of the boost provided by the exploitation of cheaper labour, paid as little as one thirtieth of US wages.

However, the basic tendency identified by Marx began to reassert itself from around 1997, when the average US profit rate began to turn down. As a result, the accumulation of profits by financial means, which had grown by leaps and bounds in the 1990s, became increasingly vulnerable.

By 1996, Greenspan pointed to what he called ""irrational exuberance,"" expressed in the tendency of stock prices to become ever-more divorced from the real economy. This warning, however, came to nothing. Greenspan, responding to the dictates and demands of finance capital, turned more openly to the provision of cheap money for speculation.

The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 was a significant turning point. It produced a depression in South-East Asia equivalent in scope to that of the 1930s in the advanced capitalist countries, but Clinton dismissed it as a mere ""glitch"" on the road to globalisation.

That was followed by the 1998 collapse of the US investment fund Long Term Capital Management, which had to be wound up in an operation conducted by the New York Federal Reserve, lest its demise brought down the whole financial system.

The dot.com bubble was then getting under way as the Fed provided ever-cheaper money. And at the behest of the financial markets, the last remnants of the regulatory mechanisms controlling their predatory operations, put in place as a result of the 1930s depression, were scrapped with the Clinton administration's 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.

The 2001 collapse of Enron revealed the dubious practices and outright criminality that increasingly marked the speculative financial bubble. Enron had pioneered new accounting practices in which profit was decided in advance to meet market expectations and then the accounts were manipulated to show the desired result.

Following the collapse of the tech and dot.com bubble, finance capital turned to the development of new methods for speculative profit accumulation, again facilitated with cheap money from the Fed. It developed highly complex and arcane financial derivatives, centred on the sub-prime mortgage market, but extending well beyond it. Goldman Sachs, among others, was a key player. It issued new products that it knew would eventually fail, but made money in the meantime by financing both sides of the deals.

The 2008 global financial crisis

In April 2007, the then chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, dismissed the possibility that the growing signs of problems with sub-prime mortgages could impact the broader market because these products only amounted to a $50 billion operation.

However, when the crisis erupted, it engulfed the entire financial system, threatening to bring down the insurance giant AIG following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This was because the methods employed in the sub-prime market were not ""rogue"" activities but typical of the financial markets as a whole.

The response of the Fed and other central banks to the 2008 crisis marked another decisive turning point. No longer was it a question of stepping in to rescue a failed individual firm. Massive intervention was required to prop up the US and global financial system as a whole.

The lowering of interest rates to historic lows--in some cases to negative levels--and the injection of trillions of dollars into the financial system did not overcome the contradictions manifested in speculation--the expression of the laws of the capitalist mode of production laid bare by Marx--but exacerbated them.

The rise and rise of financial wealth accumulation in the decade following the 2008 crisis is not the outcome of growth in the real economy. In fact, the ""recovery"" since 2009 has been the weakest in the post-war period, and marked by the fall of investment in the real economy to historic lows and a decline in productivity.

After the Lehman crisis, finance capital responded to the blowing up of its previous mechanisms for profit accumulation via speculation by creating new ones. One of these, exchange traded notes based on ""shorting"" the volatility index, or Vix--that is, betting on continued market calm, has now resulted in the most significant turbulence since the 2008 crash.

However, these new forms of speculation are only a trigger. The broader significance of the recent volatility and whatever else eventuates--no one is sure that the storm has passed--is that it was provoked by the prospect of faster growth and a push by the working class for higher wages following decades of the suppression of the class struggle.

Economic events have once again confirmed the essential conclusion of Marx's analysis of the laws of motion of the capitalist economy. Whatever its ups and downs and even periods of long upturn, the accumulation of profit--the essential driving force of capitalism--is, in the final analysis, based on the ongoing suppression of the working class and its impoverishment.

The lie, which forms the basis of all bourgeois economics, that somehow the growth of capitalist economy can, at least in the long run, provide the road to advancement for the mass of humanity, the working class, the producers of all wealth, has been exposed. It has been laid bare by the fact that signs of economic growth and a growing movement of workers against the decline in living standards have raised the prospect of a new financial disaster, even more serious than that of a decade ago.

Marx's analysis of the laws of motion of capital--laws which express themselves, as he put it, in the same way that the law of gravity asserts itself when a house collapses around our ears--far from being refuted or rendered outdated, have been confirmed by living events.

This analysis, and Marx's central conclusion that the working class has to take conscious control of the very wealth it has produced, must become its guiding perspective in the struggles now unfolding.

This historic task does not arise out of an abstract theoretical construct. In opposition to all the nostrums of bourgeois economy, which are self-serving justifications of the capitalist system, Marx's analysis is a scientific elaboration of the objective tendencies and inherent logic of capitalist development.

This logic, which assumes ever-more explosive forms, now poses directly before the international working class the necessity, if humanity is to avert a catastrophe and advance, to fight in every struggle for a perspective based on the overthrow of the reactionary and historically-outmoded profit system. That is the essential meaning of the latest round of turmoil on the financial markets.

"Hypocrisy of white liberal teachers, and how they perpetuate imperialism and racism",Liberal,44,sng6v1,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sng6v1/hypocrisy_of_white_liberal_teachers_and_how_they/,14,"Rant time. I just remembered something that a high school teacher of mine did that I see through a whole new light after the BLM movement and growing up a bit. The teacher came into class one day upset about how Roosevelt (my school) students smoked weed in the park near her house, so she said she will call the cops on them, and said she has done it before and she isn't afraid to again (this was when weed was fully illegal as well). For context my school is in Portland Oregon, which is very accepting of weed, and known as a ""leftwing utopia"" by mostly non leftist liberals, my school specifically was the most diverse school in the state, and had almost exclusively left wing (in the American sense) teachers.

This teacher was a white liberal teacher, who advocated for equality and supported BLM related things when I went there. She is a peak example of preformative activism, she wanted the social benefits that come with supporting causes like that in a diverse school, but when a slight inconvenience happens to her she's willing to risk getting some students of color in danger of getting arrested or worse, while fully understanding the consequences of calling the police on them.

To add to my issues with her this teacher like many liberals went out of her way to highlight the negative actions done by leftist states, having nearly all the ""world history"" topics be biased interpretations of socialists countries actions. Her ""world history"" educations never touched on the negative consequences of America's imperialist actions, on the contrary teaching made it seem like America was the savior of the world.

Now that BLM isn't trending I figure this is a good time to remind people not to be like her. If you shared/posted things about police violence and other racial issues then turn around and contribute to the problem then you're just as bad as the racist you think you're better than, and you need to take a good look at yourself in the mirror. I don't expect this to apply to most people here but that had to he said. Remembering that made me want to go on a rant, especially because I was stopped by the police by the park she mentioned, and had a gun pulled on me (after being searched), all while I was a Roosevelt student, fake advocates just really just disgust me.

Now that I've politically evolved I see that often the teachers I saw as progressive are really just imperialist who perpetuate racism and capitalism. At the time I thought being leftwing and against racism meant being like her, and didn't exclude calling the police on people of color, or believing America saved the world from fascism and socialism. My  education overall, but especially hers lead me to see world history, and modern times through the lense of the oppressor and imperialist, and sadly that's where  most people end their education.

I'd like to hear your thoughts about this, and personal experience. I'm new to this sub, but plan on posting a lot in the future, this was a repost with some edits from my Facebook so sorry if it doesn't seem like it was written for this audience.",1644312554.0

It really upsets me to see my friends getting married so young - what is this disgust rooted in???,Liberal,11,h0lxh0,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/h0lxh0/it_really_upsets_me_to_see_my_friends_getting/,9,"So I'm originally from a small Texas town. It's mainly conservative but the population has grown immensely in the past 5 years and it's close to Austin, so you can find all types unlike other small Texas towns. Now I'm currently a 22 year old woman and at least a dozen of the girls that were on my high school dance team with me (Ages 19-24) are already married, some even with children. 

About a year ago one of my old close friends from the dance team got married kind of out of the blue. She had gone off to college in an actual small, heavily conservative Christian town, and naturally it followed she was engaged by junior year. I never even met her husband until their wedding day which was extra weird because I was close enough to the family to be in the wedding party. Now she's pregnant and so excited to be giving birth at the end of this year and just announced her pregnancy publically. And essentially everytime I get news of another engagement or pregnancy I feel disgusted. Not in the ""I'm afraid that I'm being left behind"" way, in kind of an overbearing mom kind of way. Like ""no babe you can't undo that decision and you still have plenty of time for family."" 

When trying to look around for women with a similar feeling, the only things I could find were the classic 'I'm 35 and single and seeing other people already settled down is hard because I'm afraid I won't get that."" I want to make it clear that I feel mine is a separate reaction, rooted in the exact opposite perspective. Not ""I'm running out of time"" but more of a ""what's the rush if you're so young?""

Part of me wonders if this is some kind of internalized shame but more specifically if this emotion is prevalent amongst other feminists? Like is this disgust rooted in me being secretly afraid that their adherence to an outdated social norm will force it back onto all women? If I truly support a woman's right to choose like I claim I do, why does it bother me so much to see my young friends making that choice?",1591828141.0

A good male friend of mine, who is ""woke"" about a lot of things, just surprised me by telling me he doesn't believe in the patriarchy and that it's just a victim mindset. We were texting and here's how the conversation went:

Him: ""I dont really believe too heavily in the patriarchy I feel like it's a victim mindset. Most people who get shot are men, most people in prison are men, most homeless people are men, most suicides are male."" 

Me: ""Woooow"" 

Him: ""It's true though"" 

Me: ""Okay I'm not going to get into this because it's sleep time for me but seriously please do actual research before making statements like that. And as for the suicide rate I'm really surprised you didn't learn in psych about the fact that the only reason male suicide is higher is because they use more lethal means because they don't care what they look like and the clean up after they die but women do because, patriarchy. Women attempt suicide significantly more than men do.

The patriarchy doesn't just negatively impact women, it impacts men as well. Just do the research because you're smart and if you actually look into it and it's roots and statistics and the reasons for statistics you will definitely change your mind.""

Him:""Oh I know that men typically use more lethal means while women don't that's well known. Why would less lethal suicide methods be due to a patriarchy?
I'm open minded so fill me in I'm eager to know
 Feminists are amazing but there's some who go too far and pretend like there's an issue when there's not
There's lots of things that are bad for men, such as the other examples to only name a few""

Me:  I can find information for you but it's not my job to educate you on it. The patriarchy made those things. Men aren't supposed to show emotions so they don't get help for their issues so they kill themselves =patriarchy. I'll send stuff tomorrow
Night night x""

Him: ""Awesome, night night  x"" 

He's obviously wrong and it hurt me he actually feels this way. I'm heading to bed for the night and quite frankly have no energy to help educate him. He's very open to learning more though, so I thought this would be a great sub for me to find and share resources with him. If this post gets any traction I'll definitely show it to him. 
So I'm asking for you lovely people to share any information and resources about the patriarchy and its effects on society (including men).

I am a market socialist that believes absentee ownership (whether of a stock or home or some capital good) is illegitimate. Why do you disagree?,Liberal,17,rpeg90,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rpeg90/i_am_a_market_socialist_that_believes_absentee/,30,"Hello,

I am a market socialist. I have like 400 posts about this. If you are curious as to any aspect of how I envision it working I'd be happy to answer. Questions about finance are what I expect the most about. The answer for that lies in crowdfunding, credit unions, the bond market (which is already bigger than the stock market), and a pseudo stock market (basically time limited profit %).

To me, capitalism amounts to the ultimate state interference in the market mechanism. Basically, the idea is this. In order for a capitalist to get profit  their employees must generate more than they cost in wages. Why can't employees demand that they get the full value of their work? Because that would be classified as stealing from the company. The police would be called.

Frankly the whole wage system is fairly flawed with its incentive structure but I can elaborate more on that in the comments if you would like.

Ultimately, private ownership of the MOP is state interference on behalf of the capital class in a way that effectively subsidizes them.

Why is it illegitimate?

Well, if I perform a service or produce a product do i get get charge for it forever? Like, say company a makes cars and they buy a robot from company B to help produce those cars. Company a buys it from B. Great. B deserves compensation (I am not saying they don't). But B can't charge A for years and years if A owns it. A would be paying for a service long since provided.

This logic can be applied to landlords as well and ik this sub  loves landlords....

The way I see it, absentee ownership is basically the state forcing working people to pay for a service no longer provided.

I expect many of you to disagree. Why do you do so? Why should absentee ownership be a thing?",1640578624.0

Marx's Falling rate of profit is worthless drivel,Conservative,0,snwqun,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/snwqun/marxs_falling_rate_of_profit_is_worthless_drivel/,24,"I won't resort to pointless rhetoric and meaningless book quotations from marx's. i will cut to the chase and address marx on what he meant by the tendency of profit to fall,which is basically,as competition within and among markets tighten. profit gradually declines because more and more competition is being sorted out from the game.hence,profit is being consolidated by a monopoly/monopsony absorbing all aggregate profit.

Take this example of 3 restaurants competing for consumers.


McMao profit=200$

leninKing profit=210$

Kentucky Fried Stalin=190$

Aggregate profit of the 3 industry=600$

Assuming Kentucky Fried Stalin dominates the market and outperforms the other two leading them insolvent. does that imply Aggregate profit for Kentucky Fried Stalin shrinks for some market reasons such as demand preference(some McMao and LeninKing customers don't like Kentucky Fried Stalin)?No,because in markets,Profit is not a one way,zero sum system.Remember what Leon Walras said about consumers and producers. 

The Producer buys the consumer's money using his product/service,while the consumer buys the producer's product/service using his money. and  vice versa. the consumer sells his money inexchange of the producer's product/service and the producer sells his product/service inexchange of the consumer's money. put simply. in markets,we as individuals are both buyers/sellers and producers/consumers. therefore the prospect of profit to us is inevitable whether whe are producers or consumers. Kentucky Fried stalin's profit as producer might decline due to market uncertainties but Kentucky fried stalin's cheaper products will mean more profit for consumers who are producers too.

Another is the prospecr of emerging competition. Kentucky Fried stalin may gain the monopoly status but we know supply creates its own demand which breeds competition. so it wont take that long when Kentucky Fried Stalin gains new competitions,if not. they have the luxury to increase prices without bolstering fixed  and variable costs because monopolies really don't have problem increasing or decreasing wages for they are the sole buyer of labor in that certain industry.

To conclude, it's true that profit has its tendencies to fall. but that's only half truth. because in capitalist markets.profits and losses are not mutually exclusive. one's loss is another's profit. its not a zero sum game.",1644359155.0

It  is an interesting piece that basically argues this: Walmart and Amazon  are large, super large, on the scale of countries like Switzerland or  Sweden (in terms of GDP). They represent large scale economic  organization with highly sophisticated logistics and distribution. If we  look at the internal mechanics of Walmart, it doesn't have like an  internal market. What it actually has is large scale planning, i.e. its  stores don't compete against each other, they share resources in shared  distribution hubs, complex algorithims and computer systems control  allocation and distribution, etc. This sounds an awful lot like a  planned economy. If such organization works for walmart, it could be  applicable to a wider economy.

Alright, so I don't fully agree with this and I am happy to explain why.

So,  I think on a really fundamental level, most people don't actually  understand what a market is and how it works, and on the same note, the  term planned economy is often misunderstood.

So let's start with some basic definitions: What is a planned economy?  
I  am specifically talking about centralized planned economies here.  Decentralized planning works better but a lot of the same issues can be  encountered, just on a smaller scale. So a planned economy is one  wherein the economic resources of a country are allocated according to  the directives of some central entity. This entity can be an elected  body, a dictator, an AI system, it doesn't matter, they are all  centralized entities. There are no prices under such a system, all  allocations are determined by this board.

Alright, so with that said let's talk Walmart. Is Walmart even a planned economy of sorts?

I would say no, and because of this you can't use walmart as a justification for a planned economy to work. Why not?

Well, economic planning is **NOT**  the same thing as a planned economy. Everyone plans, the difference is  in what environment that planning takes place in. So walmart isn't  making these economic decisions in a vacuum, it is relying on existing  price signals. A centrally planned board lacks these. Walmart allocates  its resources based on the cost and expected returns on goods in certain  localities. The same good at one walmart may not cost the same as it  does at another. Why? Because again, prices and resource allocations are  driven by local markets. There isn't a central board in walmart  controlling all allocation of resources, local stores request for  certain resources from local distribution centers each trying to  maximize profit. They are planning for their future, but they still  operate within the market environment and use the information there to  do it.

Now, you may say ""couldn't i just say i want x units of whatever and that would do the same thing"" Well no.

This is where an understanding of what markets are is important.

Markets,  on their most fundamental level are effectively a tool for information  gathering and for valuing goods. Let me explain. Let's say I want to buy  a laptop. The laptop costs $800. That does not mean the actual  objective value of the laptop is $800. What it means is that the seller  of the laptop values it at $800, and is willing to trade $800 for the  laptop.

So, prices don't represent  any objective value. And thus markets don't either.  What they do  represent is people's priorities. If I really really want a new laptop, I  am willing to spend more money on it. However, I only have a limited  amount of money. So I may not be able to buy both a laptop and a new TV.  However, I personally want the laptop more so I am willingly to  sacrifice the TV in order to get the laptop. And I am willing to spend  more on the laptop than someone who wants it less than me. Basically,  money in a market is a way of evaluating priorities. If I want something  more, I am willing to spend more. So, the spending of money allocates  resources in such a way to maximize pleasure given the limited resources  available (because everyone is spending the bulk of their money on the  resources they most want. Money is prioritized towards those desired  resources).  That's how markets actually work, the prices they have  represent how much I am willing to give up in order to have this item,  and thus its value to me. Prices do NOT represent actual value, they  represent a subjective value and markets are a tool to allocate limited  resources in the best way possible. Now of course, this only works  properly if everyone has relatively equal spending power (because I may  value a resource less but have a lot more money to spend than a poor  person. As a market socialist i would argue that inequality actually  breaks the market mechanism and is ineffecient, but that is a  conversation for a later day).

Anyways,  the issue with a planned economy is that it doesn't have prices. Why is  this a problem? Because it does not allow for the most  effecient/desirable allocation of resources (nor does capitalism for the  reason I outlined earlier, but again, conversation for another day).

See  in order to feed our AI algorithim, or our dictator, or our  democratically elected central allocation board information about what  to produce, we need to gather it somehow. The issue is that, without  prices, I can demand more than is feasible to produce. Let me explain.  Given our earlier example of the laptop and TV. Because I only have  limited money, I can only afford one of those items: either the laptop  or the brand new TV. However, without prices, when the central planning  information collectors come along I can ask for both the laptop and the  TV. That's great right? Well here's the issue. The whole point of  economics is to deal with scarcity. We only have so many resources with  which to produce laptops and TVs and what not. Because I don't have to  give up one for the other, I don't have to prioritize which I want more.  This means that resources can be allocated towards building my TV when  they could've been better allocated towards building a new phone for  somebody else. In short, a planned economy allows us to over-demand  given limited resources.

Could  this be addressed through a ranking system? Sure, but I think it is  gonna be difficult to pre-plan every possible item that you desire and  compile a ranking for the placement of each item before it is produced,  then submit this to the planning board. Like, not every choice is a  choice between two items. I could be choosing between a new TV a new  laptop a new phone or like a new XBox game etc. So we'd have to rank the  desirability of a lot of items compare to other items for every item.  It's really not feasible to do that.  Plus, in the time it takes to  process that, your rankings may have changed or you may want something  new. With an AI this would be a lot smoother than with a central  planning board of people sure, but still, it can easily lead to  misallocation. Having skin in the game forces you to better prioritize  goods, and doing that through prices leads to the best resource  allocation possible given the limited nature of resources.

There  are other issues with central planning boards as well, like the  aforementioned information going out of date quickly, the fact that even  if the allocation is done by an incorruptible AI the actual  distribution and production is still done by very corruptible humans,  the issues of actually gathering the information necessary for this to  work, etc. Walmart is only so effecient because it has prices which  allow for proper resource allocation. Messing with prices messed with  resource allocation in effecient manners. (Of course, massive wealth  concentration also does this, which is why i am not capitalist either).

tl;dr: markets good, capitalism & central planning bad.",1635472422.0

This is the best subreddit I've ever participated in!,Liberal,102,rpbu5v,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rpbu5v/this_is_the_best_subreddit_ive_ever_participated/,19,"I just want to say that this is the best subreddit I participated in. I haven't seen as much diversity, nuance, caring, intelligence and open-mindedness than other subreddits. There are subreddits of various political flavours I've participated in but a lot of them tend to be myopic because discussions tend to be Americancentric. Don't get me wrong, I am aware that Reddit and Internet in general is Americancentric because of its nature and there's little one can do. But when others offer views and solutions that works in other countries, those ideas are dismissed. A lot of those discussions gets railed to parochial viewpoints and ignore anything that is not part of their country or local state. 

This gets to what I love the most about /r/SocialDemocracy: a lot of posts highlight news concerning other countries too! Too many forums make passing mention of international issues and then forget them. But in here, there is genuine care and surprising extensive knowledge of what is going on in other countries. I remember a post which asks where are social democratic movements in Asia, and then another post discussing the success of social democratic policies in Botswana. Now, that is true solidarity! Other forums would not even think pondering how is the political climate in other countries because they only think whatever the media tells them to-- which is think locally.

The level of intelligence is something I also admire. Views here are very refreshing, well informed and original. Not opinions regurgitated from others, and also not coming from what I call ""intellectual fastfood"" sources. It seems to me that many users here read more peer-reviewed literatures and academic sources than users from other forums. I have to admit that I feel embarrassed not being able to keep up with some of the discussions here because I don't get to read much high level sources.

And lastly, as a moderate left leaning person (hence why I am in a social democracy forum after all), this is truly a moderate place. Even though we all want the baseline goal of fairer conditions and treatment to workers, a good social welfare system, a just society and equitable distribution of wealth-- we're not too partisan to shun some ideas from the right. Unlike the cringey centrist/moderate subreddits, in which a lot of users seem to be centrist for the sake of being one and doesn't really have any underlying principle, we're moderate because it is based on reason. For example, we're alright with austerity so long as it doesn't cut too much of the public services. We also don't want to nationalise everything to the moon.

Sorry for the long read, I've typed too much than I intended. I appreciate this subreddit very much and hopefully the level of quality doesn't decline in many years to come!

"Socializing Truth: Marxism, Gramsci, and Intellectual Struggle",Liberal,5,sypia4,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sypia4/socializing_truth_marxism_gramsci_and/,0,"It is common for our DSA chapter to lament our over-abundance of “intellectuals,” given our location in a university town. This lamentation often produces paralysis rather than action. What might it mean to embrace the role of Marxist intellectuals and engage in local struggle from that position? The Italian communist Antonio Gramsci, who was imprisoned and killed by Mussolini’s fascist regime, provides useful tools for us to address this question and sharpen our political practice.

In last night’s DSA [Marxist Reading Group](https://emptyhandshistory.com/marxist-reading-group-introductory-syllabus/), we discussed Gramsci’s essays “The Study of Philosophy and of Historical Materialism” and “The Formation of Intellectuals,” from the *Prison Notebooks*. In these essays, he lays out the role of Marxist intellectuals: to combat capitalist “common sense,” produce “good sense,” and socialize and propagate truth to make it a basis for action. This can only be done by active “new intellectuals” through sustained contact with the people.

Here are key concepts from the texts:

**Common sense:** the received ideas and norms of society, “borrowed conceptions” of the world that render people subordinate to the capitalist social order. These are the ideas of the ruling class. The social function of intellectuals is to reproduce this common sense through institutions including schools, churches, media, etc.

**Ideology:** common sense functions as an ideology, i.e., “a world view showing itself implicitly in art, law, economic activity and in all the manifestations of individual and collective life.”

**Hegemony:** the dominance of capitalism through reproduction of its “common sense” to convince the masses that the current system is natural and beneficial to all. “The ‘spontaneous’ consent given by the great masses of the population to the direction imprinted on social life by the fundamental ruling class, a consent which comes into existence ‘historically’ from the ‘prestige’ (and hence from the trust) accruing to the ruling class from its position and its function in the world of production.”

**Organic intellectuals:** these are the “natural” intellectuals who reproduce common sense. They are connected with the masses and play important social roles in producing and reproducing ideology. Capitalism has organic intellectuals of its own, for “the capitalist entrepreneur creates with himself the industrial technician, the political economist, the organizer of a new culture, of a new law, etc.” The socialist movement must develop its own organic intellectuals who will produce the new common sense of a new social bloc.

“Organic quality of thought and cultural solidarity could only have been brought about if there had existed between the intellectuals and the simple people that unity which there should have been between theory and practice; if, that is, the intellectuals had been organically the intellectuals of those masses, if they had elaborated and made coherent the principles and problems which those masses posed by their practical activity, in this way constituting a cultural and social bloc.”

**Good sense:** the role of intellectuals is not to “discover” abstract truths but rather to criticize common sense and “socialize” and propagate truth in order to make it the basis for lived action. This is the production of what Gramsci sometimes calls “good sense.”

**The new intellectual:** a person of action who unites theory and practice (*not* a disconnected academic). “The mode of existence of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, the external and momentary arousing of sentiments and passions, but must consist of being actively involved in practical life, as a builder, an organizer, ‘permanently persuasive’  because he is not purely an orator.”

**Creation of intellectual cadres:** The new intellectuals cannot act alone. We must collectively develop our analysis and unite theory with practice. This is the role of the Marxist Reading Group and the Socialist Night School. “Critical self-consciousness signifies historically and politically the creation of intellectual cadres: a human mass does not ‘distinguish’ itself and does not become independent ‘by itself,’ without organizing itself (in a broad sense) and there is no organization without intellectuals, that is, without organizers and leaders, without the theoretical aspect of the theory-practice nexus distinguishing itself concretely in a stratum of people who ‘specialize’ in its conceptual and philosophical elaboration.”

**Role of the party:** “We must emphasize the importance and significance which the political parties have in the modern world in the elaboration and propagation of conceptions of the world, inasmuch  as they elaborate an ethic and a policy suited to themselves, that is, they act almost as historical ‘experimenters’ with these conceptions. . .  the parties are the elaborators of new integrated and all-embracing intellectual systems, in other words the annealing agents of the unity of theory and practice in the sense of real historical process.”

**Lessons from the example of intellectual/cultural struggle within religion:**

“Certain essentials are deducible from this for every cultural movement which aims to replace common sense and the former conceptions of the world in general: (1) never tire of repeating its arguments (changing the literal form): repetition is the most effective didactic mean of influencing the popular mind; (2) work incessantly to raise the intellectual level of ever-widening strata of the people, that is, by giving personality to the amorphous element of the masses, which means working to produce cadres of intellectuals of a new type who arise directly from the masses though remaining in contact with them and becoming ‘the stay of the corset.’ This second necessity, if satisfied, is the one which really changes the ‘ideological panorama’ of an age.”",1645541714.0

The Unvaccinated Need Education Not Coercion,Conservative,0,sx4d1n,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sx4d1n/the_unvaccinated_need_education_not_coercion/,56,"People who are unvaccinated are not unvaccinated because they are selfish, evil and want to hurt nor are all of them stupid. Many unvaccinated people are simply misinformed and have concerns about the vaccine. Like any other medical procedure, it's not unreasonable to want clarity that what you are putting in your body is safe.

Each unvaccinated person is different and has different reasons for refusing the vaccine. Some of these reasons are totally understandable. I can't blame Aboriginal Australians for not wanting the vaccine given horrific atrocities committed against them by the Australian government. Not wanting the vaccine because someone you know had a bad reaction is also understandable.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the unvaccinated would be open to getting the vaccine if their concerns were addressed. To those who argue that the unvaccinated 'can't be reasoned with', maybe the reason they weren't listening to you is because you were insulting them and acting in a condescending way.

Also to note, disadvantaged communities such as low income, POC and immigrants have lower vaccination rates and worse health outcomes in general. These groups often struggle more with accessing correct information and have less contact with healthcare professionals.

Also, calling someone stupid for being misinformed isn't productive. It doesn't achieve anything other than making them not listen to you. What you should do is present them with the correct information in a calm, intelligent and non condescending manner. They aren't nessecerily stupid, they are misinformed.

Treat it like sex ed. We don't get angry at a teenager who is misinformed about sex? We give them the right information. We don't call them stupid and refuse to explain things. When a pregnant woman is making a decision that could negatively affect her child, we counsel and educate that women and we ask her why she is making the harmful decision and her concerns.

It would be a good idea to invite these people to seminars where they can ask questions about the vaccine without being judged. Have people they trust and can relate to such as community leaders promote the vaccine instead of untrustworthy politicians and burocrats and elitist celebrities.

The person promoting vaccination should also not have any known political affiliation. These people are open to getting vaccinated. They just need assurance and the right information. Coercion on the other hand is both unethical and counterproductive.

Coercion is a violation of civil liberties and sets a bad precedent which will affect other bodily autonomy issues such as the right to abortion, the autonomy of pregnant women, blood donation, organ donation and forced psychiatry. It also makes people feel violated and this causes distrust in doctors and the medical system which leads to poorer long term health outcomes.",1645372826.0

I  currently work for a large pizza chain, and I'm in a rather large US  city. I am an assistant manager, and I hate every second of it.

My store's GM has told me that other GMs in the area are about as fed-up with the way the employees are treated by corporate as the minimum-wage employees are. He also told me how most of the other GMs nearly quit,  effectively all at once.  
*I know we have the backing* for the scale that we need to make changes.

*Most stores are working with broken equipment*,  and the amount of work far outweighs the pay. We aren't allowed to schedule the bodies we need in the store because it ""costs too much,""  but we are *consistently* understaffed. There's so much more that needs to be changed but I'd rather not get into it right now.

How do I get started on the organization process? How do I even get the word out? What else do I need besides the backing of a large majority of the employees in the area and a list of legitimate changes that need to be made?

I've literally never done this, legitimate help would be fantastic. I would love to help the other employees get a better work environment; if I just quit before that, it would be even worse on literally everyone else at my location.",1645446987.0
Putin is a legitimate Fascist,Liberal,2442,syrb5o,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/syrb5o/putin_is_a_legitimate_fascist/,123,"There's a lot of Putin apologia going on in other Socialist subreddits, or just a basic understanding of what Putinism is. Putin publicly embraces Russia's Socialist past, but only as a means of creating a new Nationalist identity for Russians.

Putin is a Fascist. He is a follower of Ivan Ilyin, who was a Nazi collaborator and anti-Bolshevik. Ilyin openly embraced Fascism and actively tried to create an anti-Bolshevik militant movement that would topple Communism, establish Orthodox Christianity as the State Religion, and purge Russia of anything Socialistic. He went into exile after the Russian Revolution and planned to come back and overthrow Russian Communism. When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, Ilyin tried to form an alliance with the Nazis and hoped Hitler would appoint him as the Fascist ruler of the Soviet Union after the Nazis won.

Putin is the man responsible for bringing Ilyin's body back and buried with honors in Russian soil. Putin is also known for bringing back dead White Russian generals, who fought against the Communists during the Civil War, and reburying them in Russian soil. Putin glorifies Ilyin and uses his writings in speeches, even forcing state media to broadcast such writings, and directly propagating Ilyin's ideas to Russia's political elite. Putin has even tried to integrate Orthodox Christianity back into government institutions (even using it to justify laws that target homosexuality).

This is what Putin's goal is. He wants to make a new Nationalist Russia that forgets the role of Communism and Bolshevism. He's trying to rebuild the Tsarist Russia and reclaim lost territory not just from the fall of the Soviet Union but also the Tsarist territory lost during the Civil War.

Another thing to note is that Ilyin believed Russia wasn't just a nation, but a civilization. This means (in his nationalist rationale) that the Russian people have a right to domination of foreign lands. This means that Eastern Europe or the Caucasus and Baltics (including Ukraine) as well as East Asia naturally belong to Russia and any encroaching by the West needs to be met with military force.",1645546403.0
Why the left needs to support existing socialism,Liberal,101,ss5zn3,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/ss5zn3/why_the_left_needs_to_support_existing_socialism/,145,"So this is gonna be a longer one. I see a nasty trend on the left of leftists condemning socialist countries. They go like DPRK is authoritarian. Or China is state capitalist. Or that Vietnam is capitalist. Little do they know they are actively destroying leftist movements. 

So what is actually existing socialist countries? Well they are what the name says. Socialist countries that exist. They have a left wing government and economy. Those countries being 
 
Laos🇱🇦, Cuba🇨🇺,  Vietnam🇻🇳  , China🇨🇳/🇭🇰  and North Korea🇰🇵

Some might add venezuela🇻🇪  and bolivia 🇧🇴 etc. And thats fair. These governments are in very early stages.

However many would argue to say these countries are not socialist but authoritarian state capitalist governments. Well most of these governments are marxist leninists ☭🚩. And the theory of leninism is vanguardism, dictatorship of the proletariat, democratic centralism and 2 stage theory.  So what do these terms mean? Vanguardism is a theory in which a left wing government takes power for the working class and acts in the goals of the working class. This means destroying the fascists and counter revolutionaries and socializing the economy. This stage is called dictatorship of the proletariat or dotp. Democratic centralism is an electoral system where labor union councils elect representatives who elect or appoint other people in power. Does it have cracks? Hell yeah you bet. But the thing is to fix it. This is a very grassroots level of structuring society. 2 stage theory is what i think is most important to talk about. So for marx and lenin socialism is a transitional stage between capitalism and communism. And for lenin a poor fuedal or colonized nation needs to pass through 2 stages to reach communism. Stage 1 capitalism. And stage 2 socialism. So lenins NEP was state capitalist. He gave peasants land and a market and thus private property to build productive forces. Now people throw that term a lot so what is it? Those are the physical conditions for socialism. Because marx showed that socialism arises from the ashes of capitalism and industrial society due to capitalisms ability to create tons of wealth this makes sense why lenin would develop 2 stage theory. And this makes even more sense why stalin said they achieved socialism. Because at least in my mind they did. They collectivized agriculture and industry and used the wealth from commodity production and used profits and surplus value to fund society. Thats why stalin industrialized so fast. Because when you work profits go to boss. Imagine if the 100 billion bezos made went into funding society. You would not need to tax income. Keep all of that in mind.

So now that we talked about socialism in a marxist leninist sense. And its ok if you have some disagreements you must understand the theory that these nations are abiding by. We can talk about why they need support and why they are socialist and how to break the cold war propaganda.

China🇨🇳/🇭🇰

Ill rapid fire these. One of the biggest concerns is China. Its so polarizing that r/socialism literally has a tag for this. This isnt prc related so i hope its not triggered and hidden into oblivion. You see many leftists fall for the red scare propaganda. And there's tons of it. And you have so much that people want to disassociate with it entirely. And its detrimental to the cause. So is it socialist? Well china has increased cooperative farming. And they have 5 year plans for their state owned enterprises. Their private sector is vast and foreign companies can only do business in the special economic zones. 57 percent of private sector is unionized and all state owned enterprises are unionized.  All unions belong to All China Federation of Trade unions. While it has not pushed collective bargaining in some areas. It does help keep wages up. The issue is because its tied to the CPC that it will fill the quota of the governments 5 year plans than the workers. And whats those plans? Well it is to industrialize and acquire more wealth and modernize. The bullet trains, producing more wind and solar energy than any nation. Fund schooling. And healthcare and social safety nets. The 2020 to 2025 5 year plan seeks to ditch the usa and become self reliant due to the hostility and cold war(prepare for economic decline my americans).The private sector has given clashes to the economy. Because the cpc has many ideologies (the socdems, the maoists, the progressives, the xi jiping thought people and liberals) it is always at odds. And because people dont vote some members in as they are appointed by representatives who were voted in it has issues of transparency and does bad shit for the people. This furious need to industrialize is whats harming china but its also leading it to prosperity. Did you know china has high homeownership rate? That means they are not renting or have a landlord. This is an objective good thing. They have only 2 percent hunger rate and have destroyed covid. Chinese people have like 7 degrees and they move to usa and become very affluent. This is the effect of structuring their economy this way. Use profits to fund society. Essence of leninist economy.  

So what does this mean? Its socialist in a leninist sense. And this is rhe 2nd world superpower. If you condem this with no nuance and feed into the bullshit you will aid in its demise. China is ussr 2.0 so lets not let it end up the way USSR did. Usa political economy is falling. We are losing wars. Countries are turning left like in south america and leftism is gaining traction in places like india. Plus if china falls the DPRKs only trading partner will fall.  Which leads us into dprk

North Korea🇰🇵

The DPRK is under lots of hate. You hear Kim Jong un is a dictator that enslaves and eats babies and that trains dont work and electricity is done and the people are trapped. Ofc this has no naunce. The dprk is a 3rd world country and has 3rd world issues. Im haitian and i have family in haiti. No electricity is pretty common. Its kinda shitty when ur on the phone with them and it cuts out cause haitian wifi is trash. But i digress. The dprk is poor no doubt but for a long time after the war it was actually outpacing the south in many regards despite 20 percent of their population being murdered, towns being leveled, and most land so bombed its not useable. And still they provide housing for most. Healthcare for all that was acknowledged by the WHO for polio elimination
https://www.who.int/dprkorea/news/detail/15-05-2018-who-and-unicef-support-dpr-korea-to-re-introduce-inactivated-polio-vaccine-(ipv)-in-its-national-immunization-programme-from-15th-may-2018

Is kim jong un a dictatorship? Well it depends on what thay word means. A dictator is someone with absolute power. So a Saudi monarch is a dictatorship. One in which the usa supports and in which is doing a genocide against yemen. Kim jong un is only leader of the workers party and the military. He does not do judiciary things nor does he create the laws. They have a constitution. He only plans the economy and the military strat.  So hes not a dictator by that metric. So no hes not killing political prisoners himself with his bare hands. Hes got judges who see if the prisoner should be killed. While im anti death pentalty just remember that almost half the world uses the death penatly. Including the usa. Which has more prisoners than dprk per capita. Well then one could say he has a cult of personality. I mean i guess to a degree. But i think there might be valid reasons why many people will fly his banner and praise him. Its like in russia that even tho stalin is dead he is praised and celebrated for his achievements. In short theres nuance.

About the economy. They are mainly a planned economy based on the soviet systems. Labor councils vote representatives that vote in people. And they help make sure the quotas are fufilled for the 5 year plan. The economy is collective and thus its socialist. I have my critiques of juche but i think it came because the need to build your industry is important. Leninist building productive forces. So if thats the case why are people starving? Its like i said. A lot of land is still shit and not even usable. Plus the sanctions. Before anyone says anything yes the DPRK asked for an IMF loan durint the 90s and the usa wanted it to starve and placed more sanctions. Its horrific. If you dont know that in the 90s there was a famine cause by a drought, a monsoon flood and the ussr dissolution. So many people died. Now they have bounced back but 35 percent still are food insecure/hungry and 60 percent are in poverty. Add on top of that the usa has troops stationed in the south practicing invasion for dprk and funding the southern military. So when usa media cries about dprk making nukes they cannot be suprised. Dprk was actually willing to disarm in 2018 but only if the usa did. And the usa did not want to. This is active warfare. Dont feed into the propaganda to destroy this country. Dprk wants to work with usa. It was willing to take imf loan and liberalize aspects like vietnam and yet it is the most sanctioned nation. Despite all that it is able to educate and give access to housing and healthcare to the people.

Vietnam🇻🇳

Vietnam i think gets less hate but is moreso called a capitalist nation. And as weve seen so far. Socialism is a transitional stage where economy is collectivized and there is dotp. China has aspects of it. Korea has it. And vietnam has it as well. Their private sector is regulated and its wealth is used to fund society. A lot of vietnamese citizens are farmers and they make up a lot of collectives. Very decentralized but cooperatives nonetheless. While its much more liberalized and the state owned enterprises are small only accounting for 40 percent of profits. That profit goes into funding society. Built on democratic centralism and nearly 70 percent of workers are unionized its apparent that it follows its socialist mixed economy. There is struggle but they are in process of constructing socialism. 

""Socialism is about making people rich and powerful... Socialism is to bring the people with freedom, prosperity, happiness, and chances of education, medical care, and good accommodation."" Ho chi Minh

Thats what they are doing. Building wealth and productive forces. And Vietnam is the fastest growing economy. Plus it has very low hunger rate, high home ownership etc. While the education and healthcare isnt free it is subsidized by the government. Making it mostly accessible. Liberalizing healthcare was one of the IMF quid pro quo in order to give the loan.

So i think this fits in the spirit of ho chi minh and leninist socialism.

Laos🇱🇦

Now i feel like Laos isnt talked about often. Like its the social reject of its 4 brothers and is not talked about in news. But yeah laos is shaky. Healthcare is not as good. Homeowner ship is way lower. Education is free but mixed for college. And a 27 percent hunger rate. During vietnam war laos was bombed a ton. And so they had to build their country up. It follows the same democratic Centralism. Decentralized economy with a mostly public sector of state owned enterprises. A nation built on unions it is a fast growing economy. All i have to say for now is time will tell. Laos is doing what it can to build productive forces and fix economic issues.

Cuba🇨🇺

This country is touted as a poor mess. While its poor i dont think its a mess. It has created its own vaccine and is the best economy in the Caribbean. It has one of the most strongest healthcare for a 3rd world nation and has more doctors per person. It has lower hunger rate than usa at 2 percent and a higher homeownership rate than usa at 90 percent. Higher life expectancy. And free education and medicine despite vicious embargoes. Now is it socialist? Well cuba has not liberalized and still follows a planned economy. 76 percent of the economy is state owned and there is mass unionization. It follows the leninist model of using the profits to fund society. They are also trying to push the private sector to be cooperatives. So i think its apparent that it is still socialist and is doing well despite the 60 year embargo. Because this nation was sanctioned to high hell and then invaded by the usa during the bay of pigs invasion. Is it authoritarian? Well i think that words a bit of a buzzword. Its authoritarian in tje sense of defense. And that can bring some issues. But you can critique the government. In fact during the july 2021 protests Canel went out to talk to protesters. What were they protesting? The issues caused by pandemic and the embargo. Before a color revolution was instigated by the usa. Its ability to defend itself is why cubas been able to hold out. Castro had 600 assasination attempts. And any spies and conspirators got the firing squad on them. Rightfully so(im against death penalty but if you are trying to bring back colonial landlords and sex slavers you need to die).

So all in all what does this mean? Should we defend everything these nations do? No. I just think we shouldnt condemn them and distance ourselves from them like many leftists do. I see Aoc and the dsa do this and its killing our movement. Are these countries socialist? Well if ur an anarchist then this wouldnt fit an anarchist definition of socialism. But if ur a marxist this does. Marx said socialism is a transitionary stage. And lenin highlighted this more. Socialism is not only people owning means of production. Its more complex and has many factors. Means of productions are public(state owned enterprises). Dotp protects workers rights (high unionization). Low hunger programs, free education, free or cheap healthcare. Housing initiatives and high homeownership rates. Industrialization. Economy built for collective good. This is what a socialist economy is. Fun fact on homeownership rate. The countries with highest homeownership are all socialist or ex socialist countries.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

A lot of the authoritarianism is just countries defending themselves. A lot of issues stem from countries being 3rd world. These countries are not state capitalist as the economy is public or structures for social good. Capitalism existing does not negate this. In marxs gotha program critique he talks about the stages of communism. In lower stage we see exactly what these nations are.

>What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. 

Many orthodox marxists will call out leninists as revisionist but marx says this exact thing. Socialism wont be perfect and there will be capitalistic aspects of socialism. But whatever the workers produce like food he shall get back in return like education or healthcare. Socialism is not shiny. I want people to know that. It wont be utopia. Its hard work. And all these nations are doing hard work. So we need to prepare for the american decline and agitate and organize. 
Solidarity with the actually existing socialist nations.

"Heteronormative And Homonormative Relationship Dynamics: ""I Wish I Was a Lesbian""",Liberal,49,r9zflf,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/r9zflf/heteronormative_and_homonormative_relationship/,37,"What do hetero women mean when they say stuff like ""I wish I was a lesbian"" could be translated to ""I wish I was lucky enough to have a significant other that actually understood me like you have"", or alternatively, ""I wish I had a relationship in which I wasn't bond to traditional gender roles and expectations"" 


What those rather heteropessimist or heterofatalist women are trying to say is that they wish they had a relationship with dynamics similar to those usually within or found in gay relationships, they want an homonormative relationship but lack the language to verbalize their feelings and thoughts, awareness and/or the possibilities of obtaining one.

If you didn't get what I am trying to say, I think homonormative and heteronormative relationship dynamics are better understood when we think of sapphic/lesbian couples as examples.


A relationship with an heteronormative dynamic is a relationship in which different divisions of gender roles and expectations are present and so are power imbalances based upon the presence of such imbalanced divisions, roles and expectations.

Different variants of heteronormative dynamics are found in hetero and queer relationships, the rather problematic, to say the least, traditional cis-hetero-conformative model of relationships is perhaps the most obviously visible example of such dynamics, but healthier variants of heteronormative relationship dynamics can also be found not only in butch + femme lesbian relationships, but also in role reversal hetero relationships, or other relationships in which gender roles division imbalances exists but are not forced or expected between the individuals involved in the relationship.


The opposite of relationships with heteronormative dynamics are relationships with homonormative dynamics, relationships in which gender roles either doesn't exist or, when they exist in the relationship, they are divided nearly if not equally, and therefore are not forced upon or expected from anybody involved in the relationship, while power imbalances related to gender doesn't exist for such reason, but other kinds of power imbalances may still be present when that comes to physical strength and age, for example.


Perhaps the most clear example of a relationship with an homonormative dynamic is that of femme + femme lesbian relationships, but such rather feminist gender equality dynamics are also found in butch + butch lesbian relationships, or among androgynous/genderqueer woman + androgynous/genderqueer man in rather genderqueer hetero relationships.


Also, please do not go down so harsh on people dissatisfied with their orientations, like the heteropesimist or heterofatalist women, as like if we all didn't share struggles, differently, but we all struggle from traditional compulsory cis-hetero-conformativity imposed and forced upon us.",1638767880.0

The state as cheapest property protection,Conservative,6,1g2knb,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/1g2knb/the_state_as_cheapest_property_protection/,5,"I think all anarchists agree that the modern state serves to protect the upper class and wealth stratification. My understanding of anarcho-capitalist theory is that if the state is abolished, the privilege current capitalist enterprises (corporations, etc) have will also be dissolved. I agree with this, but I'm unsure about why capitalists would want that, and why capitalists in an anarchist society would keep society stateless. 

I've often heard that in anarcho-capitalist society private property will be protected by private security forces. This makes me queasy because why wouldn't capitalists just support the formation of a state and have their workers pay for the protection of private property through taxes?

Like Proudon talks about in Property is Theft,  it is the working class that pays for the protection of capitalists' property. It is unjust because capitalists don't pay an appropriate amount of money for their proportion of protection they receive from the state. While i think we can all agree that this is unjust, that does not mean people will not support it or that such a system will not come into being.

To me, the state, funded by working class taxes, is an ideal way for the capitalists to protect their property, whereas in an anarcho-capitalist society, capitalists would actually have to pay for their property's protection and incur the costs. So, the idea of the state not reconstituting itself in an ancap society makes me skeptical because there is financial incentive for capitalists to just agree to form a state over the entirety of society because then they skip out on a large majority of the cost of defense, shifting the costs onto lesser/non-property owners and keeping the wealth they would have spent on protection to themselves. This is mostly worrisome because this motive is rooted in the mechanics of market competition that capitalists support.

TL;DR If there is financial incentive for capitalists to support the formation of a state by shifting the costs of property protection onto working class taxpayers, why wouldn't they do it an an anarcho-capitalist society?   ",1370898337.0

Minimum wage goes up what about those in the work Field already?,Conservative,0,t3xb6e,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/t3xb6e/minimum_wage_goes_up_what_about_those_in_the_work/,182,"So minimum wage goes up that’s great… but than everything else goes up… what about people who had to work hard and get promoted to make the $24 an hr they make now. Shouldn’t they get a pay raise of $5 to account for the minimum wage/inflation  going up?

I haven’t heard anyone bring this up (at least I haven’t seen this brought up. Please place links below if you have) 

I just think it’s unfair. Personally, I’ve worked hard to get to where I am and now the teen who flips burger makes $15 an hr? Not trying to be mean but certain job positions should be making so much… entry level people get paid less because companies have to invest in training them as newcomers to the workforce… I know some don’t like to here this but feelings aren’t facts guys! You can’t live in this la la land where you make big bucks for minimum effort… you’re crashing America with that mindset.

Edit to add more context: 

I understand that this post is a bit whiny towards the end to a lot of people SOOOO 

To clarify I’m looking for the viewpoint on minimum wage being so high and how are you feel it’s affecting the cost of living. ( or if it’s even affecting the cost of living at all) 

I feel that corporations aren’t giving high enough raises to people already in the workforce Who worked their way up the ladder for their dollar to account for pricing going up at the rate that it is due to minimum wage having drastically gone up. 

I understand that a lot of you want the idea of everyone living in this nation where no one is hungry and starving. I’m not saying I want people to starve. 

I’m saying minimum wage was never meant to be a livable wage it’s an entry-level wage. For example you’re a youngster usually a minor in your entering the workforce for the 1st time. Maybe your college student. Your wage was never meant to stain a family. It was meant to help you gain the experience to apply for better jobs in the future. 
Companies have to train people who like experience and they invest into those people. These people make mistakes for example if they’re handling money they short drawers on change accidentally. ( Of course companies take this happening into account) 

I think there’s a better solution for providing generational wealth for future generations. Like educating highschoolers better so they’re better prepared to enter the work field. Explaining to them how to get an education for less how to apply for scholarships how to write resumes. How to properly ask for raises and make valid points as to why they deserve those raises  based on job performance and being able to bring facts that prove their job performance is worthy of that extra raise they are asking for. 

I feel that raising minimum wage the way they are doing is not the solution long-term for having less people in poverty. Educating people is a solution for that. 

Guys look at California their minimum wage has always been higher than other states and it’s literally the most expensive state to live in. The minimum wage there is not livable. What makes you think that raising the minimum wage in other states isn’t going to cause the same problem that California is facing? 

These are the things that I would love to hear people in the comments bring up on. I chose this about it specifically because people here will have a different viewpoints on mine and I don’t want to be an echo chamber.  I’m not looking to argue that I am right and all of you are wrong i’m looking for someone to challenge my viewpoint hard enough that I doubt it. 

I hope this edit helps future commentors.

Additional edit:

A person rapes another (even though more people would be armed, some would still find a way to incapacitate a victim). The wrongdoer gets away and the victim sues the wrongdoer. The dispute organization invites the wrongdoer to attend the trial/session, but the wrongdoer refuses even to communicate. The wrongdoer also has no security company, or otherwise, to automatically engage in talks.

This is where I start to run out of ideas. Would the dispute organization be able to issue a warrant to collect more evidence? If not, I imagine the dispute organization would analyze the evidence without the wrongdoer's defense and conclude that a certain restitution/punishment would be appropriate. After that, the big questions arises: how would the restitution/punishment be fulfilled? ",1355008312.0

A critique of gun bans.,Liberal,3,o47r3q,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/o47r3q/a_critique_of_gun_bans/,2,"Tl;dr : if you can make a meth lab, you can make a bomb.

I understand not all liberals support strict gun control measures such as assault weapon bans and buy back programs. From what I gather, things like private gun ownership, legalization of marijuana, and LGBT rights are actually pretty bipartisan with only some extreme partisan outliers. I also understand that most liberals in favor of gun control laws aren't interested in draconian policies and mass seizures, but rather better regulation and tracking measure to better impeded and prevent the distribution of weapons into known offenders and potentially mentally unstable individuals. And it's also important reconcile that gun violence is ultimately a symptom of a mix larger 3 deminensial issue spanning poverty, drugs, illiteracy, discrimination, domestic violence, and mental health. There are no simple solutions. The purpose of this critique is to hopefully demonstrate to those who believe gun controls measures, even the most draconian ones, will not solve one specific problem: mass indiscriminate murder. Or put simply, mass shootings. 

Those who intend to wage violence, and have the resources to do so, will wage violence. By eliminating access to the tools for which you perceive to be the most likely Avenue in which violence will be conducted, you merely divert them into engaging in less damaging violence, or paths in which the violence the engage in will be equal, or just as damaging. The only varying factor in the level of carnage achieved in acts of mass indiscriminate violence, is planning. By eliminating access to firearms, you merely force them to go through extra steps to obtain the same weapons, or seek alternative weapons, which may in fact be equally as dangerous or more dangerous. In effect, you do not prevent the crime, you merely delay or delude it.

In further, the only real way to prevent this sort of crime isn't through stricter and harsher laws pertaining to the weapons and tools likely or potentially to be used in these crimes, but instead through better and more in depth survellience and preemptive action. This may sound well and fine... but that is in fact the same action that was taken to prevent a second 9/11, and in doing so, they effectively gutted and hallowed out the fourth amendment and completely eroded privacy protections in the u.s. Did it work? Yes, but at what cost? To stop further mass indiscriminate violence by a domestic population and citizenry, you'd need to further expand and enforce the same survellience systems and use them to target the native population. In effect, you'd need to replicate the same police state as china.

Which raises the question, in fighting mass indiscriminate violence, what rights and liberties are you willing to forgo? To create a safer society, what must we be willing to sacrifice?

"Profit, consumer product quality, and other criteria for product lifespan decisions",Conservative,3,qsui9w,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qsui9w/profit_consumer_product_quality_and_other/,0,"Wikipedia wrote:

>In economics, many problems involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods is determined by the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization

> planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life or a purposely frail design, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain pre-determined period of time upon which it decrementally functions or suddenly ceases to function, or might be perceived as unfashionable. The rationale behind this strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as ""shortening the replacement cycle""). It is the deliberate shortening of a lifespan of a product to force people to purchase functional replacements.

>Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an oligopoly. Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the customer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them (see brand loyalty). In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an information asymmetry between the producer, who knows how long the product was designed to last, and the customer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence


Note that even if a product manufacturer wants the product to last a reasonably long time, it is impossible for a product to last forever, and any product design optimized too heavily toward lifespan is likely to sacrifice more important factors. Even a very skilled engineer cannot guarantee high value for the consumer by simply sacrificing profit or maximizing any set of desirable factors. Further, some important economic ideas, such as ""externalities"" and ""goodwill,"" cannot be factored into most engineering calculations.


Many introductory books on capitalism suggest the profit is the only objective that must be optimized in any capitalist system. However, in any system with product design, the profit derived from a product is only one technical consideration. Some superficial proponents of capitalism sometimes argue that capitalism is the only system that works, and any system that is not profitable must be discarded immediately. However, in practice, capitalist factory owners are often willing to sink money into very costly product development campaigns that lose money for years.


Even though profits can be optimized in the short run, this can lead to ""wreck it and run"" management, in which a new manager takes over a company, throws it into chaos to jack up the stock price temporarily, takes profits by selling stock, and then retires with a golden parachute while the company crashes and burns.


Here is my modest proposal for people who advocate capitalism: be cautious of saying, ""Profit is the most important thing,"" or ""The rights of the shareholders are the only important rights.""",1636782198.0

 the $130 million loss on its US operations is most likely due to a common practice for US multinational corporations: structuring their operations so that overseas subsidiaries are the ones reporting income, leaving the US operation to have little or no taxable income to report.

A recent report from the US Department of the Treasury found 61% of the international profits of US multinational companies are booked in seven small countries -- Bermuda, the Caymans, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore and Switzerland -- known as tax havens. 

The financial filing by Tesla doesn't spell out what it did exactly, though. For example, it doesn't say which country or countries it made its profit in while reporting a US loss. And Tesla declined to respond to a question about its filing.

Do libertarians tend to conflate socialism with centre-left liberalism and social democracy?,Conservative,0,sxdmgz,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sxdmgz/do_libertarians_tend_to_conflate_socialism_with/,34,"The vibe I get from libertarians is that socialism is whenever the government *does stuff.* 

Any form of public healthcare? That's socialism. Environmental regulations and public investment in a green future? That's socialism. A welfare state designed to help poor people survive and lift themselves out of poverty? That's socialism. Minimum wage and labour laws? That's socialism. Subsidies for higher education or student debt relief? That's socialism. Regulations requiring that people wear masks and get vaccinated to stop the spread of COVID-19? That's socialism.

I've never understood this view. It's as if *anything* that involves public programs or positive liberty is branded by libertarians as socialism and a gateway drug to communism and therefore undesirable. I got called a ""commie pinko"" on Quora once for suggesting universal healthcare and I got called a ""communist"" for suggesting that mandatory duties and obligations exist parallel to rights and freedoms. People have called Joe Biden, an explicitly neoliberal politician, a ""communist"". Bernie Sanders, despite being a politician that would be considered a centrist in most other capitalist countries, has of course been called a ""communist"". And Justin Trudeau, a neoliberal who the Canadian left decries as being a neoliberal capitalist shill, has been called a communist.

There seems to be a huge gulf between what libertarians consider socialism and what socialism actually is. 

Socialism is NOT simply taxes, wealth redistribution, and state-administered public services within a capitalistic and free-market framework. That's what most of the capitalist world practices, and that's what the progressive faction of the democratic party wants the U.S to adopt. People like AOC, Bernie Sanders, other Democrats and the America left at large don't want to turn America into the USSR or North Korea, they want to turn it into the UK, Denmark, Germany, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Those countries are pretty awesome in many ways. 

Socialism is a **needs-based economy utilizing** ***collective ownership of the means of production*** **under the auspices of a communist party that exercises one-party rule through Marxist-Leninist democratic centralism.** 

Socialism involves the expropriation of private enterprise, central economic planning, and the use of state-directed markets to create a superabundant society whereby *communism*, a stateless, classless, and moneyless post-scarcity society, can be achieved. Socialism has nothing to do with welfare programs, public school, or wealth redistribution through taxes. It's a radically different way of structuring the economy. 

Ideologies like social democracy, progressive strains of modern liberalism or New Deal style politics aren't even close to being socialist. They are 100% capitalistic ideologies. They accept and embrace the capitalist mode of production, fully recognize the necessity of private enterprise and free markets, and don't believe that wage labour is exploitative. In fact, many of those countries with ""socialist"" policies actually have freer markets than the United States.

It all went downhill from there. After that I quickly fell into the echo chamber trap of historical revisionism and dictator apologia. Thankfully I didn't stay there. I couldn't self-delude myself into believing that the communist regimes were good or that everything bad about them could be dismissed as propaganda or justifiable. I realized how stupid promoting revolution was. I also didn't like the way communists treated theorists and leaders like they were prophets. So I decided that I couldn't continue to consider myself part of that ideology. Liberty and democracy are much to important for that.

The idea of a UBI is stupid and unworkable,Conservative,114,rdrvin,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/rdrvin/the_idea_of_a_ubi_is_stupid_and_unworkable/,203,"There are many people who promote the idea of a **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** and I do not understand how these people think it would work financially. I'm Australian, so I will use an Australian example, with $ being AU.

In Australia, the total population is around 25 million, and 80% of those are 15+ (those who would recieve a UBI). That makes a total number of UBI recipients being 20 million people.

Now, the federal government of Australia currently takes in (in 2019-20 fy) [$469.4bn](https://budget.gov.au/2021-22/content/bp1/download/bp1_bs5.pdf), and spends about [$225bn](https://budget.gov.au/2021-22/content/bp1/download/bp1_bs6.pdf) on social security and welfare. That $225bn of social welfare equates to about $11,250 per Australian 15+ spent on social welfare annually (225bn/20m). This is not equally distributed, of course, as not everyone receives social welfare.

Now, the people who support a UBI want it to be at least above the poverty lin. According to the [Melbourne Institute](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/3889393/Poverty-Lines-Australia-March-2021.pdf), the poverty line for a couple +2 kids is $1090 per week. This equates to $56,680 annually per couple, or **$28,340 annually per adult 15+** (28,340\*20m).

If we assume that the UBI is set just at this poverty line, social security levels in Australia would increase to **$566.8bn annually**, **$341bn more** than what the government already pays in social security and more than entire government income is currently.

Now, what some people who support the UBI say is that companies would be required to pay more tax, or workers who earn an income would be required to pay more tax. Both of these arguments are filled with folly.

* **Require companies to pay more tax.** I will be the first to admit that I believe companies should be paying more tax - 30% of Australian companies paid no income tax last year. However, companies paid $84bn in tax in 2020-21. If you expect companies to pay double their income tax, assuming no other fallout from international tax dodging, you would only receive another $84bn in tax revenue - far short of the $341bn requirement.
* **Requiring workers to pay more in tax**. The idea behind this is that is everyone receives $28,340 per year, then the amount of tax paid on their salary should increase. The problem with this is that it disincentives work. Currently the Australian federal government receives $217bn in personal income tax. If we require an additional $341bn from each worker ([13 million workers in Australia](https://lmip.gov.au/default.aspx?LMIP/GainInsights/IndustryInformation)), that would require an **additional $26,230 in taxation per worker**. That means that each worker would only receive, on average, a benefit of $2,100 per year after the UBI was in effect. Additionally, though, you would have a *disincentive* to work. As you are already receiving $28,340 per year, the financial benefits of working are reduced by that level. It makes work less attractive and would ultimately reduce productivity in the economy. It would also have a negative impact on poverty in the long-run, because you would have generations of people entrenched in the idea of 'having just enough to survive' but having no desire to go beyond watching Netflix or YouTube all day, but they will still be relying on the services provided by the people who do want to benefit themselves and society - it is just that these groups will not be subsidising the people who are not working.

This brings up a point which is very important - **work is good**. If you go to /antiwork or many other subs, you get the impression that work is inherently bad. However, work is required for an economy and society to function, and the relationships between different types of jobs are very important. Everything we own, use and rely on is a result of the work of others. Should people be fairly compensated? Absolutely, and I personally support the idea of strengthening anti-slavery laws for international trade. However, some jobs are not designed, or supposed to be, careers. Ideally, you shouldn't be working at McDonald's as a cook whilst trying to support your family, nor should you be trying to support a family as a checkout operator at a supermarket. I do not mean to demean these jobs - I really do not, I spent years working like this. I am meaning to say, though, that the skills required for these jobs are lower than other jobs. 

The skills required to become a doctor or dentist are more than a checkout operator. However, everything is relative. If you double the salary of a checkout operator, then this causes these more required jobs to be less attractive. As a result, less people will spend the years training to do these higher-skilled jobs, and you will have a shortage which will eventually push up costs. This will then result in a new equilibrium, with everything just being more expensive.

As a way to finish my rambling, and to link back to the UBI, I think that people who promote the idea of a UBI do not have an understanding of how the economy works. They do not understand the relationship between income and motivation, and the requirement of having some level of inequality. I think they overestimate the 'intrinsic' motivation that people have and underestimate the motivation of 'need' - many people would be happy to live their lives off the money provided by others only to have their minimum needs met - and this would have a negative impact on both society and the economy at large.",1639198074.0

This, on paper, seems very logical, capitalists would want a free market so they can freely do what they want and no government to interfere and holding them back.

Though i believe that this notion is only valid at the beginning. After the capitalists have become big enough with enough reach, influence and wealth, the free market no longer seems like a good option.  Why choose to let others compete with you when you can keep yourself on top forever? Capitalists, i believe would opt for preservation of their position, even if it means making the market less free.

One way they could do this is through the government by lobbying. The government, politicians would not be able to be partial because in the end, the one paying their bills and putting them in their seats are the wealthy, those with influence and power. The capitalists would always have power to influence the government and why wouldn't they use it to their advantage? The way i see it, the government would always lean toward the capitalists regardless of which side of the aisle they are on. 

All in all, capitalists prefer the free market for themselves but not others because that is the best way to maximize profit and they can do so through the government. That is why i believe the notion that capitalists are pro-free market and anti-government is not true.",1642567848.0

A reworked model for market socialist entrepreneurship,Liberal,10,qyq5nm,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qyq5nm/a_reworked_model_for_market_socialist/,6,"Hello,

So I have been re-working the entrepreneurial model I proposed a week or two ago on this sub and others and tried to better adapt it to criticisms I have received. As I am always looking to improve my ideas, I am looking for feedback/critiques here as well. I got critiques from left and right last time, so i'm gonna try that again.

&#x200B;

Alright: New and improved model:

This is my attempt to solve a fundamental issue in market socialism. Basically the single most common critique of market socialism I have heard from capitalists is: ""You are perfectly free to start a coop in the free market, so why aren't there more""

As I have outlined in many many posts, the answer is twofold: A lack of investor and founder incentives. The investor incentives problem is solved relatively easily by things like kickstarter and credit unions. The more fundamental issue is the founder incentives.

Starting a business is a lot of hard work, even in the capitalist system. There are a lot of upfront costs, like getting space, buying required machinery, establishing client networks, building an MVP, etc. That's before the first product is even sold. So if you can't get a big return for bearing all this personal cost and hardship, why start the firm? This is the issue of founder incentives.

The founder of a firm (and when I say founder, I mean any number of people, many firms were started by like 4 or 5 people. Some were started by 1. The founder refers to whoever (1 to however many people) actually started the firm. They are who I am talking about) creates most of the value of a firm BEFORE it sells its first product. Their job primarily exists in the pre-profit phase. After profit rolls in they basically just act as a manager/another worker. See, the workers that join the firm after the founders create most of their value take on those roles as well, managers, workers, etc. But they are doing so WHILE the firm is profitable. Sometimes it takes years and years and years for a firm to get started, and be profitable. And the founders don't really get windfall until that happens, and are liable for costs should everything go under, which is very possible. Many socialists contend that founders aren't special, they are just other workers. This is true, AFTER profit rolls in. Beforehand, the case is a little bit different, basically the issue is that they are doing work and not really getting compensated because again, no profit. The primary value that the founders create is BEFORE profit rolls in.

So then, yes founders aren't special and aren't any different from other workers, it's just that the timing of the value they create is different than other workers, i.e. most workers value creation happens after profits, the opposite is true for founders.

Does this make sense so far? because this is critical for the next part of my idea.

In a capitalist market, this issue is dealt with by giving the founders permanent ownership over the firm and the means of production, i.e. once the firm is profitable, they own it and get the largest share of profit (basically total profit - wages - operating costs). The ownership of the means of production gives the founders a greater degree of power over the workers and thus can underpay them and can exploit surplus value. Basically, the issue with the capitalist market is the power dynamics created by ownership of the means of production.

So, how can this problem be solved in a market socialist environment?

Here is my attempt:

A futures contract. Let me explain. As stated earlier, the founders value is done before profit. So what if the founders controlled say 50% of stock in the firm (again, the founders can be more than one person. If it was 4 people, each would have 50/4 = 12.5% of stock). Well technically they wouldn't have stock, they would own a futures contract with the basis of a stock. They would have to sell this stock to the workers over the firm at some pre-determined price and time. However, in the meantime they would hold it.  
So say I start a video game company. As the founder and sole worker, i would own 100% of stock (well technicality 50% and then 50% through a futures contract). I set out the basic game idea, mechanics, do some art and music, write some code and get a skeleton version working. Then I hire another worker. Since this worker is hired before the firm is profitable, they can be considered a founder. Now I own 25% of the founder stock and 25% of the worker stock, for a total of 50%. Together we finish the game and sell it. Now we hire another worker to help manage sales and all that. So now I own 25% of founder stock and 17% of worker stock, for a total of 42% of all stock. Now remember, 25% of this is founder stock, so at some point in the future the workers will have to own it.

Alright, in the meantime I get 42% of profits, my first worker gets 42%, and the new employee gets 17% (yes I know this adds up to 101, I rounded 17 actually is like 16.6666667% but that was too bad looking to write).

This does ensure the founder has a stronger voice in their vision and that they are fairly compensated for pre-profit work.

However, in the long run, the firm will become 100% worker owned. Short run, the founder gets extra kickbacks for pre-profit work.

Why is this not exploiting the worker?

Because they are getting paid for PRE-PROFIT work, i.e. employee #3 did not create as much value as employees #1 (me) and #2. So why should they get an equal share of the profit? Employees #1 and #2 both made the entire game. See what I am getting at?

So, this is not worker exploitation by the classic socialist definition because: it is compensation for work before profits came in. Think of it like this: the workers are the construction workers and the founder is the blueprint creator. Money only rolls in once the house is built, but that doesn't mean the blueprint doesn't have value and that the person who drew it doesn't deserve compensation.   
It doesn't entitle them to extra profits forever, simply for a limited time.

&#x200B;

So, this has incorporated specific criticisms of past models. It has a definite time limit, a more clear explanation as to how it prevents exploitation, and better shows how it would lead to a 100% worker owned firm in the future. Furthermore, it solves the issue of entrepreneurial founder incetives by ensuring the founders get extra kickbacks for the work they put in pre-profit, which I feel isn't addressed in enough market socialist circles.

&#x200B;

Anyways, what do you think of my more refined entrepreneurial market socialist model. 

&#x200B;

I did take some inspiration from here: [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/Pdf.aspx\_.pdf](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/Pdf.aspx_.pdf)

In here they talk about a bonus but idk if that is enough motivation. I do think that the futures contract is a more elaborate but long term sustainable solution.

Shattering communist blunder on anti-Rags to Riches stories,Conservative,0,swupgi,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/swupgi/shattering_communist_blunder_on_antirags_to/,14,"We are aware of How communists invalidate the hardwork by those who started off with nothing then eventually ended up succesful with all the fortunes and popularity.My Uncle is a case in point.

So,given the communist narrative. if a worker is capable of rising on top. from proletariat to bourjwazee. it follows that a worker is inevitably bound to be an exploiter too,from this point,the communist exploitation narrative breaks into pieces because poor people can end up rich and rich people can end up poor. but i know commies wont submitt to this blatant fact as doing so will be devastating to their marxist egos. for them, victimology is always top priority. there's always a victim and there's always an oppressor but we know this is not the case in reality.people regardless of class is inclined to exploit people.",1645338313.0

What is the Truth About Modern China?,Liberal,5,s5q4jr,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/s5q4jr/what_is_the_truth_about_modern_china/,36,"For whatever reason this just keeps bothering me, and I don't know why. I keep thinking about what China's is like, how their economy works, and my mind keeps getting this bad feeling, like for as much as everyone calls the country communist I can't help but get the sense the Chinese economy is far more capitalist and depraved than America's in a lot of ways, and their government is not the benevolent Confucian leftist government we ought to aspire to. But I really don't know, I hear from tankies and people I suspect might be tankies are saying all negative claims against China are all capitalist western propaganda, I've spoken to other leftists who say those tankies are incorrect, and I can't tell who to believe or what is fact and what are propaganda lies and I am atrocious at research, especially with something so complex. I come here searching for the truth, please help.

It's important to know that I understand that this does not apply to Chinese citizens, like anybody anywhere everyone is just living their lives the best they can, this has nothing to do with ordinary people on the ground. I also understand Chinese culture has different priorities than North American societies like the one I'm from, Chinese culture prioritizes the good of the community as opposed to over here where the individual is the priority, personally I'm of the belief that both should be in equilibrium and both of us could learn from the other but that's besides the point. The point is there are certain things like super invasive 24 hour surveillance that is seen as a good thing rather than oppressive, and all this is very important to keep in mind.

I hear of rampant censorship and media control going on over there, things like banning any criticisms of the state or depictions of trans people, gay folks, and men who show any amount of what the government deems feminine. Two stories come to mind as examples, both taking place in late 2019. There was an episode of South Park called Band in China, one plot involved the boys getting a movie about their rock band but the Hollywood executive as well as various Chinese censors kept telling them what they couldn't say in order to get the movie aired in China such as not saying America is a free country or whatever, the other plot was about Stan's dad Randy traveling to China to sell weed over there and finding out if he wants to sell weed there he has to suck up to the Chinese government and anything that displeases the government will get him permabanned from the country. This episode got the entire series banned, any trace of the show online even small mentions on chat rooms were scrubbed clean. Around the same time a Hearthstone player who went by Blitzchung won a tournament, during the interview he made the statement ""liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time"" the hosts ducked and covered as though a drive by shootout was coming their way and the stream was cut off immediately. Blizzard fired the hosts, banned Blitzchung from tournament participation for a whole year, and revoked his prize money, all to avoid the wrath of the Chinese government. After the backlash to what happened all that happened was Blizzard reduced the ban by 6 months.

I've heard about China's Belt and Road initiative, touted as a generous leftist project but is really a new form of colonialism. Instead of going in and taking over or installing a puppet dictator they gain good will as well as put them in debt, making those countries indentured servants to the state without them thinking or realizing it. Not only that but I see stiff posted in subreddits like r/democracy showing the leaders denouncing democracy and human rights, hard for me to believe that's a truly left wing communist state when the whole point of such ideologies is to emancipate people from slavery and suffering, not trade one form if oppression for another.

What also gets me questioning China's claims of communism is, as stated before, the way business is conducted over there. Now I've heard that wealth distribution is far more ideal within China, people have been lifted out of poverty, and billionaires are supposedly outlawed, folks like Jack Ma are in exile and though I don't agree with those methods I do agree with the idea of preventing wealth hoarding of course. Yet there's still a stock market akin to what western capitalist nations have, incentivizing hyper capitalist business models to please wealthy investors. Not to mention you have Chinese corporations like Tencent and Alibaba doing very sketchy business practices like data harvesting and monopolizing via buying other other businesses both domestically and abroad. Though it's not a product by either of those formerly mentioned corporations I can point to the games of Mihoyo implementing predatory gacha monetization in all their games, including their ultra poplar Genshin Impact, that's just one single example out of many. Yeah, very leftist indeed.

Then there's the story of the Uyghurs, I can't get the story straight. I hear about the enslavement of these people, but then I hear from thus one communist that the story is misleading, that it all spun from a poor BBC segment where they asked if anybody was allowed to practice their religion at the school and they said no and that got spun into a story of oppression when in reality it's no different than public school policies in North America, that there is no possible reason why the Chinese government would even want to enslave the Uyghurs.

Yet I'm not sure what to believe, as I said I've had tankies say China is a communist paradise and any and all negative claims about China are pure propaganda, none are even remotely true according to them, and any leftist who says otherwise has just internalized that propaganda, so that means Vaush is a complete rube according to these tankies. It's not far fetched to believe propaganda is being fed to us to oppose China, but I can't believe China is the proletariat paradise they say it is either. I've spoken to leftists who have said those tankies are nuts and delusional, that China really is an oppressive regime, one of them shared footage of this guy who was in police custody for saying negative things about said police in a chat room while drunk, poor guy was strapped down like he was Hannibal Lectern, being absolutely humiliated and forced to apologize, then they arrested him anyway.

The reason I want the truth is because I want to make sure if I ever have any criticisms for China I'm making proper criticisms and not saying anything untrue, I hate mischaracterization of anything, and as an aspiring artist I don't want any of my art to say something wrong. I also care about humanity, it's why I'm on the left, any injustice anywhere is my concern. Finally it seems like China is set to become the next world superpower as far as I know, I recognize I could be wrong, and honestly I'd rather world superpowers not be a thing but that's how things work right now, and I'm just scared that should they become the next superpower they'll undo any and all freedoms and human rights everywhere. I know America is the biggest threat to those right now, I'm under no illusion, and it does sicken me, but I fear what we do have will be gone with China calling the shots and any and all progress will be halted. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm being paranoid, that's literally what this is for, to clear things up, I care about the truth as much as I care about human rights.",1642379513.0
(Satire) Why We Need Mandatory Hand Washing Stations,Conservative,0,sqtjuq,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sqtjuq/satire_why_we_need_mandatory_hand_washing_stations/,9,"It's already been established that **there is no right to infect people with potentially deadly sicknesses and diseases.** It's a clear violation of the non-aggression principle.

That said, I don't think we're doing enough as a society to protect ourselves from COVID. Even if we get vaccinated and wear masks, we can still spread these diseases such as COVID. **Hand sanitizing stations are NOT enough.** Still, since mask and vaccine mandates work so well, let's take it a step further and call for hand washing stations everywhere. **We've already been having mandates** and rules for a number of years now. All it is, is a necessary step in the fight against COVID.

**After all, it's been scientifically proven that washing hands reduces the spread of sickness and disease such as COVID. Therefore, clean hands are a RIGHT.** It's part of essential healthcare that the government should provide to all of its citizens. It'll be enforced similarly to vaccine passports and mask mandates. Have a hand washing station and wash hands before stepping into a business. If possible, have police and private security standing guard so that every customer, client, and employee complies.

If people have a problem with it, that's too bad. There's no right or entitlement to these businesses' services. **By questioning these rules, you're questioning science.** Stop the spread of misinformation and crazy conspiracy theories. People can still be sick asymptomatically, which means you can be spreading diseases without even knowing it!! Anyone who opposes these measures is a potential FASCIST and should be de-platformed and fired from his/her job. **There is no right to spread misinformation about clean hands.**

How do we fund this, you ask? Let's tax all the rich people and then re-distribute with grants and forgivable loans. Small businesses won't really be losing that much business. It's a no brainer. We'll pump money back into the economy. We'll create plenty of blue collar jobs because of the plumbing and supply movement. If anything, this will benefit the economy because people won't be getting sick!!! It would be good for the news and for our government to track statistics of all Americans who wash their hands at least five time per day.

**If small and medium sized businesses don't provide a right to clean hands, then they should not be in business. Full stop.**

This might suck for now, but it's all for the common good. Let's call for reasonable government intervention to stop the spread of disease until COVID, flu, cold, and all the rest of them are eradicated from this earth.

Minimum wage increases do not cause inflation. It’s the other way around.,Conservative,3,sgn65l,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/sgn65l/minimum_wage_increases_do_not_cause_inflation_its/,62,"Inflation is not caused by the increase of minimum wage. Inflation is strictly caused by the increase of money in circulation. When the federal reserve prints more money, inflation is a byproduct. Money adheres to the principle of scarcity. More money = less scarcity = lower value.

But it’s understandable why people still dislike minimum wage increases. Usually, they indicate that inflation is hitting the market. In a scarce market with finite cash, minimum wage will stay the same. Unless people in higher paying jobs take a pay cut for minimum wage to go up, minimum wage will stay the same. 

If a flood of newly-printed money comes along, inflation hits. The value of the dollar goes down and your salary now has less purchasing power. It’s necessary to adjust your pay for inflation to assure that your purchasing power is where it was at before inflation occurred. If you could afford a $3 muffin before inflation, but now muffins are $5, your salary should be increased such that you can still afford the $5 muffin. 

Same goes for minimum wage. The minimum wage should (and will) be increased so that people who make minimum wage can afford what they could afford before inflation hit. 

People seem to associate inflation with minimum wage because minimum wage is the only widely-known wage standard out there, and inflation hits around the same time that minimum wage goes up. But as you now see from above, minimum wage increases aren’t a cause of inflation, rather an effect. 

Side note: the visibility of minimum wage, I’d hypothesize, has an impact on the cost of living adjustment during inflationary periods. People don’t like to see minimum wage go up because they associate it with inflation. So of course, it’s a public matter that is often a hot topic of debate. Minimum wage, in some areas, may not be adjusted appropriately for inflation. That’s why you may see people advocating for seemingly high spikes in how much minimum wage should be. It’s possible that inflation has significantly outpaced minimum wage for a given state, and is in desperate need of updating. At the end of the day, increasing minimum wage is not a byproduct of wanting to give too much credit to people who do “the minimum” for society—it’s a byproduct of reckless government spending which results in the federal reserve printing more and more US dollars, resulting in inflation that changes the value of the dollars we all have in our pockets.",1643588357.0

Founder and unifier: Victor Adler,Liberal,41,qoog0b,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qoog0b/founder_and_unifier_victor_adler/,12,"Hello friends, comrades and colleagues

through a coincidence yesterday at the state meeting of the *Sozialistische Jugend* (Socialist Youth), which I attended, I found an interesting book about Austria Social Democracy, which of course I bought. And one of the great pictures in it was of Victor Adler - founder of the SDAP (*Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei*, Social Democratic Workers Party) in Austria.

So: today I'd like to tell the story of Victor Adler.

&#x200B;

**Birth, upbringing and early life**

Victor (originally Viktor) Adler was born on June 24th 1852 in Prague, Bohemia which was part of the Austrian Empire. He was the oldest of five children - his parents being Salomon Markus Adler (a trader) and his wife Johanna (born Herzl). Both moved to Prague only the year before, they came froma little town in Central Moravia.

His family was jewish, this would shape Victor and his path quite a lot.

In 1855, the family moved to Vienna and lived in the *2. Bezirk* (Second District) known as Leopoldstadt, at that time a sprawling district and shaping to be one of the most luxurious. Family Adler could afford this as the father made a lot of money with realty trading. In Vienna, Adler attended the prestigeous *Schottengymnasium* (a catholic private school) followed by the University of Vienna, studying first Chemistry, then from 1872 to 1881 Medicine.

**First contact with politics - start of a stony road**

Through his friend Engelbert Pernerstorfer, one of his life-long companions, he was admitted to the german-national fraternity *Arminia Wien* during his time at the University. Already in 1870, Adler aligned himself with the views of the *Deutschnationalen* (German nationals) in Austria under Georg von Schönerer. Their view was that Germany as such should be united in the *Großdeutsche Lösung* (Great German Solution, this would essentially be the German Empire of 1870 plus todays Czech Republic plus Austria and all german speaking regions) - their minimum demand was to unite German Austria with Germany.

Adler follwed the movement for quite some time and was part of the team working on the *Linzer Programm* of 1882 - a broad base line for the *Deutschnationalen*. But soon after, Adler and Schönerer passed ways - while Adler was more on the social side of things, Schönerer introduced Aryan checks into the party - which angered Adler and he left.

Only a year before Adler started working at the Mental Hospital of the Vienna General Hospital. During a journey to England in 1883 he met some famous people: Friedrich Engels, after the death of Marx the head of Socialism - Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel, the leaders of the SPD in Germany. This must have triggered something in Adler - he started learning about Marxism and seeing the problems of the Industrialisation.

Also in 1883 he began practising as a neurologist, starting in 1882 as a doctor for poor people. His office was on the same spot where in 1891 Sigmund Freud would move in - interesting coincidences :D

One of his first ideas was to found a newspaper called ""*Gleichheit*"" (Equality) in 1886, financed by the testament of his father. In Gleichheit, he addressed for instance the problems of workers in the *Wienerberger* brick factory - one of the first social reports. But soon enough, *Gleichheit* was censored and forbidden with Adler having first juridical problems and accusations.

&#x200B;

**Uniting the movement - Foundation of the SDAP**

To continue his work for a better life for workers and poor people, Adler founded the Arbeiter-Zeitung (Workers Paper) in 1889, for which he sacrificed a lot of his own money. Beginning as a bi-weekly paper, it soon became a daily newspaper with Friedrich Austerlitz as chief editor of the paper.

1885 became one of the first possibilites to unify the workers movements in Austria and the monarchy in general in reaction to the planned *Sozialistengesetze* (Socialist Laws) of Prime Minister Taaffe. Over time, Adler was able to unify radicals and centrists - a thing seeming impossible for a lot. In the last days of 1888, all groups rallied in Hainfeld for the first party meeting. On **January 1st 1889** the SDAP was founded, marking the birthday of Austrias Social Democratic movement (a date often forgotten by comrades in the party). Adler achieved to unify different groups (Unions, Cooperations and small Workers groups) to one great organisation - to one great Workers Party. On the same day, Victor Adler was voted party head - a place he should keep until his death.

Engels and Bebel, with which he stayed in contact until they died, helped him a lot with information and advice, especially Bebel.

&#x200B;

**Between theory and praxis - working for a better life**

Soon after the foundation, the first party program was constituted, the *Brünner Programm* of 1889, dealing with the language and nationality problems of the multiethnical Empire. For the Austrian half of the Empire Adler and his part demanded a democratic nationality federation. In short: this would call for a nation (in this case one half of the Empire) to constitute itself as a democratic federal republic with rights for the other ethnicites and probably more autonomy.

From 1901 onwards Adler was a representative for the *Landtag* (state council) of *Niederösterreich* (Lower Austria), only in 1905 he was able to enter the Reichstag (Imperial Council), the parliament of Austria.

The first great goal was the *Wahlrechtsreform* (Voting Rights Reform) so all men could vote. But instead of calling for revolution, he went the way of reform - talking with influential people to sway them. So it was due to him that the Reform passed in 1906, speaking with almost all parties of the Council and the k.k. (*Kaiserlich und könglich*, Imperial and Royal) Government. His work was rewarded a year later, as the SDAP became the strongest party in the *Reichsrat*, occupying 87 of 516 seats. But he couldn't keep the movement wholly united - in 1911 the Czechs split off the greater party and founded the Czech Social Democratic Party.

On an international level, Adler called for a united peace policy of Social Democracy at the Congress of Basel before 1914.

&#x200B;

**1914 -** ***Burgfrieden*** **and its consequences**

As the Reichsrat was disbanded before the start of World War I in August 1914, there was no possibility to really vote on this matter in parliament. But nonetheless, Adler and a lot in the SDAP supported the War Credits as they saw the war as a defensive one against Tsarist Russia. He too was in favour of the SPDs move to do the same, but they had a working parliament in contrast to Austria-Hungary.

Soon enough, Adler and the SDAP realised the problem. Otto Bauer, one of the young critics of Adler and the party leaders, was captured in 1914 and a lot of members were at the front. At a conference in 1916 they again stated that only a democratic federation of nation states was the only solution to bring peace, especially in internal Austrian-Hungarian affairs. Financial cooperation with Germany was accepted as long as it remained free trade.

But instead of Karl Renner, Adler was against territorial conquests but neither really for a *Frieden one Annexionen* (Peace without Annexations). His belief in the possibility of victory remained up until the summer of 1916. Only then, the mood changed - demanding peace.

&#x200B;

**Peace, peace, peace**

On October 21st 1916, Adlers son Friedrich (later a prominent figure in the party) shot the k.k. Prime Minister Count Stürkgh as a protest to the *Kriegsdiktatur* (War Dictatorship). Although he was senteced to death, the new Emperor Karl I. reduced the punishment to life-long prison. This changed something in Victor Adler, he saw the idealism in his own son Friedrich.

In November 1916, the Lower Austrian part of the SDAP wanted an immediate white peace. Following the diplomatic note for a peace from the Central Powers, to which Adler was supportive, nothing happened in that direction. Early in 1917 the Imperial Council again went into action - with the SDAP as biggest party calling for an immediate end of the war. With the Revolutions in 1917, Adler stopped his policy of adapting and more towards actively trying to achieve more, this was shown at the socialist peace conference in Stockholm in 1917. But what if the government is just saying things and not acting on them?  Then strike!

Exactly this happened in January 1918, as over 700.000 workers striked. The *Jännerstreik* (January strike) for peace and better living conditions, as food was drestically rationed and living conditions worsened severly. With that and the talks in Brest-Litowsk early 1918, the left in the party tried to change the line on the nationalities in the Empire to a dissolution of the latter in nation states.

Adler was against that, remaining on the idea of the democratic national federation. But he avioded fragmentation of the party (like in Germany) by bringing the left side of the party (with Otto Bauer) more into the top.

&#x200B;

**Dissolution of the Empire and death**

In his last days in October 1918, Adler became part of the *Provisorische Nationalversammlung* (Provisional National Council) for German Austria. One thing he said was, that the current state of affairs shows the victory of democracy all over as the Habsburg Empire broke down into nation states. Now it would be possible to transfer to socialism, his hope was that it wouldn't become a bloddy affair.

In the first provisional government, Adler became, although quite old and sick with his heart, Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Sekretär des Äußeren) under Chancellor Karl Renner, his party colleague. In this office he spoke with Emperor Karl and Empress Zita about the transition from the old system to a new one. But soon he had to realise, that a democratic national federation was impossible - only then he advocated for *Anschuss an Deutschland* (becoming part of Germany) and the nation now founded be a republic named *Deutschösterreich* (German Austria). This idea was put into a motion on November 11th 1918 as karl abdicated and Adler still lived. On the next day, this motion was passed.

But as the monarchy passed, so did Victor Adler. He died late on November 11th 1918, never being able to see what became of Austria, at age 66 of a heart failure in Vienna. The next day, great mourning ceremonies began and he was buried a few days later at Viennas *Zentralfriedhof* under great participation of the people.

Adlers comparatively young death probably results from his radical input. He spent a lot of money and often enough risked his own life and health to work for the party - some still say he literally lived for the party and allowed to a mostly peaceful transition from monarchy to democracy.

Otto Bauer once said about Victor Adler:

*„Adler hat den Kampf um die Demokratie in dem Glauben geführt, die Demokratie könne das alte Österreich umgestalten, modernisieren; in Wirklichkeit mußte sie es sprengen.“*

(Adler fought for democracy with the belief, that democracy could turn around the old Austria, modernise it; in reality it had to blow it up.)

&#x200B;

**Family:**

Victor Adler was married to Emma, born Brown (1858-1935). They met and married in 1878.

His first son Friedrich, as mentioned a famous figure for the party in the First Republic, was the oldest one, born in 1879.

&#x200B;

Final remarks

In 2021, Victor Adler remains a great figure of Austrian Social Democracy as the one that founded the party and spent his life and effort to bring it to fruition. He was and still is honoured a lot with streets and places named after him - one high party distinction is the *Victor-Adler-Plakette*. For me Victor Adler is a person I can look up to, trying to unite two different ends to one and never being too radical in thought and action, only in private and for the party. He sacrificed a lot and I think, he would be proud what his party achieved since his death alost 103 years ago.

But not only the party, what became of the nation and it's people - he sure was a great Social Democrat sadly too often overlooked by others. A great idol and reminder of what we can achieve and do. Made it possible for Socialism to succeed in Central Europe besides the SPD - being a role model for a lot of future generations.

Conflating socialism with Marxism has caused damage on the socialist movement,Liberal,78,qe1cg1,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qe1cg1/conflating_socialism_with_marxism_has_caused/,97,"""Before Marxists *established a hegemony over definitions of socialism*, the term socialism was a broad concept which referred to one or more of various theories aimed at solving the labour problem through radical changes in the capitalist economy. Descriptions of the problem, explanations of its causes and proposed solutions such as the abolition of private property or supporting cooperatives and public ownership varied among socialist philosophies.""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_socialism

Thanks to Marxism and derivatives the socialist narrative has largely been about the mode of production, many times neglecting social issues to focus on materialism. Socialists have fought for social rights issues for a long time—yet the mode of production, to seize control over it and completely remove private ownership is always there at the center. *I think this is disingenuous to the root of socialism which as I have said a million times is to care for the people's well being*.

Marx, Engels and so many others seem to think that classes, specifically economic classes are the root cause of most if not all strife. *That is simply not true* and simplifies something that yes, is partially deeply rooted in economic class differences, but social factors are equally if not even more important. 

I recently officially joined the Social Democrats (Swe) after going to my first ever political meeting (with SocDems). As a socialist I felt at home as they/we talked about for example school and physical activities like sports. The other guys organize and talk to various sports organizations to ask them what it is they want, such as upgrades to sporting facilities. So in one way or another it more or less almost always comes back to money, sure, but that is the very society we live in today. But my point is that the main focus was always, in this meeting, *on just improving things in life for others*. THERE you have what line of thought led to the creation of socialism hundreds of years ago; to see how unfair the world is and simply wanting to improve it due to your own empathy for others. Does this apply to other ideologies as well? Well of course it does. But that does not mean it still isn't what basically started socialism. Socialism is thus, or orginially was and as such at its core about certain ways to improve the world.

The longer people do not see socialism for the spectrum that it really is and *always* has been the longer we will stay divided amongst the various socialist communities, between socialists and non-socialists and even between non-socialists as someone might hate socialism because they think it is one very specific thing, leading to anti-sentiment rather than just preferring something else.

how to actually end racism,Conservative,0,sunwx0,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sunwx0/how_to_actually_end_racism/,45," 

Since racism is a feeling of hate that lives in peoples hearts, we have to be diligent and aggressive in attacking racism. Sorry, putting up signs at sports games won't do anything except for burn people out to the cause because the idiotic lack of effort making a sign takes.

if you make a sign that says end racism, you are a poser pretending to care enough to take action. all sign writers need to be shamed.

instead, we need to have a strict system of social and institutional powers that are obligated to report any instance of racism including verbal (the most important because it manifests itself verbally most of the time) and for institutional, muniscipal and lawful action to be taken to identify, document, investigate and eventually isolate any single person that engages in racism.

a white supremacist republican may only say the n word a few times in his/her/zer life before committing an act of hatred. we need a very strict social system that will work in tandem to identify every single racist person in our society.

once the racist people are gone, racism will no longer spread and multiply. like a virus, we need to be willing to take every measure no matter what in order to get rid of it.

Hello (M17), I am from Tigray which is where the Genocide is happening right now in Africa. This should be every humans issue but people are so divided these days I have to go around and request help from different communities. Women in Tigray are being raped. I have personally received a video of a raped Tigrayan woman in surgery and they removed nails and other foreign objects that were shoved in her uterus by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. [**HERE**](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2C20P0) is an article about it.

I have heard a lot of disgusting stories. But I have never seen anything like this. More than 200 are rape victims in one barely functioning hospital which was looted and only 5 of them have come forward in fear of stigma. Around 150 of them have contracted HIV which was the goal of the Ethiopian government. Now most of these women are going to die while giving birth or another horrible scenario. Those kids are going to grow up orphaned, HIV positive and probably starving if this madness doesn't stop. I have lost 2 of my uncles. I am not saying this to seek sympathy but to shed light on the Genocide that's happening.

I found out one of my uncles was dead on Facebook where there was this picture of his bloodied dead body and his best friends also dead surrounded by Ethiopian soldiers laughing at them and I didn't tell my mom what I saw to let her find out in a different way and she did. And anyone who has a loving mother knows what it feels like to see your mother grief, filled with pain. Now imagine the grief of those mothers that are literally seeing there sons being shot in the head or even worse getting beaten to death in order not to waste bullets.

**WARNING GRAPHIC SHORT STORY AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Eritreans and Ethiopian soldiers entered a house and wanted to rape this girl. Her brother said ""I would not let you rape my sister"" and they straight up shot him in the head with no remorse. And they raped her right there in front of her brothers bleeding lifeless body. She is the one that told this story.

Another one is ""Eritreans and/or Ethiopian soldiers entered a house where there was this preacher. They told him to rape his daughter or watch her get raped by them. I will not share the results of that situation as it is toooooo disturbing .

The women are suffering the most here. They rape and humiliate those women. Please donate what ever extra thing you have and if you don't, no worries just spread awareness about it.

**Click** [**HERE**](https://omnatigray.org/) **for a website dedicated to the Tigray Genocide so that you can learn more about it and get more info.**

Thank you for your support whether it is an upvote or sharing it with your friends and families .

And if you want picture and videos to see the brutality that's happening which I do not recommend, DM me. But I will not share the video of the women in surgery whose gentiles are shown for her mental health in the future.

Now normally I would be willing to forgive a channel if there is **three or less people** in it who were entirely white. But in a country that is 20% Asian and 25% non-white, the whiteness of your people on set and behind the scenes speaks volumes about you.

I'm not asking for something radical. Just basic equality and presence like most social democratic parties are fighting for behind the scenes and politically worldwide.

But that is also why I can't stand either channels. ""Lily-white progressives"", ""Champaign liberals"" and etc are just some groups I dislike because I'm literally trying to make my own community better.

Excerpt from Smedley Butler's War is a Racket,Liberal,5,t0iwi4,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/t0iwi4/excerpt_from_smedley_butlers_war_is_a_racket/,1,"WAR is a racket. It always has been.

It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.

A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ""inside"" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.

In the World War [I] a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns no one knows.

How many of these war millionaires shouldered a rifle? How many of them dug a trench? How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat-infested dug-out? How many of them spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets? How many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy?

Does computer allocation and big data make the lange model viable in the 21st century?,Liberal,14,r2r1g4,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/r2r1g4/does_computer_allocation_and_big_data_make_the/,9," 

Hello,

So I have been spending a lot of time recently reading up on a very interesting Project in 1970s Chile called Project Cybersyn ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project\_Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn))  which was basically an attempt to create a computer controlled  centrally planned economy. As I understand it, this doesn't neccesairly  solve the Economic Calculation problem proposed by Mises because it  doesn't properly account for opportunity costs due to the lack of a  price mechanism. However, I also have read up on the Lange Model ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lange_model), [https://www.econ.iastate.edu/ask-an-economist/what-do-economists-think-lange-model-does-it-address-economic-calculation-problem](https://www.econ.iastate.edu/ask-an-economist/what-do-economists-think-lange-model-does-it-address-economic-calculation-problem)) which seeks to implement a price system within central planning to solve this issue.

Anyways,  long story short, I was wondering if combining computer planning to  speed up calculations and predictions of shortages/surpluses would make  the Lange model viable?

I  had a couple doubts, notably this system does have prices and  allocation calculations can be done by the computer, but the actual  allocation is done by people, and people don't always play ball. History  is full of cases of people skimming a bit off the top for themselves. I  would worry that corruption is still an issue at stake, as has been an  issue for centralized planned economies of the past. I also worry about  innovation. it's hard to predict future trends based on the past and  consumers often don't realize the value of a good until it is presented.  This was the case with vegetable peelers in the Soviet Union.

So  I have my doubts. Personally I prefer worker coops in an actual market,  not a state run one, but I;d love to see what y'all think.",1637943951.0

As many of you have heard, there was a shooting Saturday night at an anti-fascist Black Lives Matter march for [Amir Locke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Amir_Locke), a black man murdered by police on a no-knock warrant. The march was held by [Justice for Patrick Kimmons](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2218262565131221/?ref=share) (JFPK), an activist group that fights for justice for Patrick, who was murdered by police in 2018, and all others murdered and brutalized by the cops. Before the march had walked more than 30 steps, a violent killer, Ben Smith, exited a house and immediately fired upon the march’s unarmed corkers (traffic control comrades). 

TRex (aka June Knightly) was killed and four others were wounded. Further deaths were prevented by comrades who provided medical care on scene and those who non-fatally shot the shooter. 

The shooter, Ben Smith, who went by “polybun” online was subscribed to known fascist, Andy Ngo, and he was known for making violent, anti-semitic and anti-antifascist remarks online, escalating to the events of Saturday night. The mainstream press has characterized him as “a homeowner” (this is not even true; he was renting) and his violent, fascist attack on peaceful marchers as “a confrontation.” This was no confrontation. It was a fascist act of terror.

Love and solidarity from the Portland area to our comrades near and far. We protect us.

Does anyone else feel like the discussion of which system is best gets frequently conflated with technology and people?,Liberal,0,szmj2f,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/szmj2f/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_discussion_of/,3,"Preface: Im not making an argument more of an obersation that i would like some input on.

Let me explain. Any system will fail horribly if the people are inadequate to maintain it, for whatever reason. At the same time, any system can ""work"" with the right people. For example, a benevolent monarch or dictator over ""pure democracy"". Or capitalism if (i know how this sounds) every capitalist had more human compassion than greed. 

So, along with the quality of people, technology matters. As technology increases, life becomes overall easier regardless of system. For example getting from a to b, getting treated medically, finding information, communicating, getting a resource, etc.

Bearing these two points in mind, technology and people, how much bearing does the type of goverment really have? I agree it matters a lot. The question is how much? 

Some examples i see where this conflation occurs. Phrases like ""capitalists are evil."" (So are non-capitalists). Or ""socialism will distribute resources better."" Depends on the people in charge. 

Also in historical examples. For example USSR getting credit for industrialization. But wait....industrialization would have occured either way (we may assume.) Same in China. China is a historical civilization that would have industrialized either way. I assume if ""communism"" never existed, China would still have done most of what they did (build factories, high speed rail, military, etc.) Of course same thing in America. Once coal, trains, steel exisyed, industrialization was BOUND to occur. Even under a king or any government IMO. 

In conclusion, i notice people give most or all credit to government type. I believe most of the credit for all accomplishments goes to the people themselves and technological improvement.

 Follow them they are good. A left wing big media page that is easy to share and change minds. Or get conversations going. I added red sun in the sky at the end as a joke. The joke was that maos land reform campaign called for the peasants to kill their landlord.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Reform_Movement_(China)#:~:text=The%20campaign%20involved%20the%20mass,land%20redistribution%20to%20the%20peasantry.

This is an objective good thing. They got rid of the landlords and people did not have to pay rent anymore. People who lived on the farms and people who lived in the houses owned those houses. Thats why china has a high homeownership rate.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546956/#:~:text=Today%20China%20is%20a%20country,et%20al.%2C%202020).

In fact many ex communist states despite a rise in homelessness have higher homeownership rates than much of the west

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

This is a good thing. China has very little homelessness. Communist china. A country that plans its economy using state owned enterprises. They got rid og the rich oppressors. And now china has subsidized cheap housing program. Meaning that even if you rent. Its at a fixed rate and its cheap. They regulate the market which is why recessions are almost non existent.

Yes china is not perfect. China just lets hong kong people in misery. 58 percent of people are poor. The wealthy live lavishly and china does not provide unions for parts of the capitalist economy. Racial issues and allowing capitalists to run policy in the party.

But there is nuance. Why cant we talk about the stregnth of these nations. This is the issue of the western left. My previous posts highlight that the western left will not support actually existing socialist countries cause 1. They are not ideologically pure and do some bad shit socially or economically. And they lack nuance or view these countries as scary villains. This is all a ploy of the neo cold war and yall are feeding it

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Cold_War

The lefts lack of support manufactures consent for our countries to do warfare against china. Remember trumps trade wars. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45899310

They failed of course because almost all corporations manufacture in china. So if yoy put a tariff on chinese goods its essentially a tariff on the usa. Increasing a deficit.

And no one really batted an eye. China is strong. But is dprk. Vietnam. Laos. Cuba. Venezuela. Bolivia strong enouguh to deal with sanctions. Embargoes. Tarriffs? Today it was taxes on china. Next its arming a fascist group to coup the cpc. Everytime i say critical support for china people scream as if i said lets support hitler.

The black panthers supported maos china. Kim il sung. Ho chi minh. Fidel. Khrushchev. Socialists in africa. Etc. They had an internationalist approach. Anf thats what we need. Anti imperialism. ""But chinas imperialist"". China doesnt force countries to trade with it. Or get loans. The usa and IMF do. They say if you dont do it pur way we will coup you like bolivia and Venezuela. And when you take a loan you will make unions illegal and lower the minimum wage and liberalize everything. And thats what africa had to do. The west enslaved and colonized Africa. Then asked them to pay colonial tax and allow the west to use their labor force. While the loans are expensive for china they are better than the usa. Its mutual agreement. More cpuntries are willingly joining the belt and road.

All in all how can we be like china bad. When we have 67 percent homeownership and homelessness is on the rise. Housing prices are on the rise. This chuckle fuck that was that land lord are why people cant live. 37 percebt of paycheck goes into housing. Why is china seen as bad when it provides housing for its people. It provides jobs. And food and healthcare and education for its people. 

I support china. Im critical but no one in good faith can say that this is bad actually. Mao killing landlords and giving people houses is bad actually. Think critically. Look at the uk and usa. Do they have housing for people.

Dont feed into the neo cold war. Have nuanced critical Support for internationalist socialist countries. Especially china the internationalist red sun in the sky.

My thoughts on the conspiracy theory issue in a lot of the west,Liberal,16,r0tths,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/r0tths/my_thoughts_on_the_conspiracy_theory_issue_in_a/,5,"See I have an idea, but idk if it is the proper approach. Would love feedback.


One thing I have noticed (and prepare yourself for this truly shocking revelation) is that in times of fear and uncertainty people trends towards conspiracy theories which tends towards authoritarianism.

Let me explain:

Immediately before the rise of Nazi Germany or fascist Italy a number of things happened. The most obvious is the First World War which wrecked devastation on much of Europe at the time as millions of young men were throw into a slaughterhouse for inches of ground. This went on for four years. In Russia, the mishandling of the war on the part of the tsar, coupled with famines (which generated economic troubles, food insecurity, and of course fear and death). Conspiracies swirled about Rasputin's influence on the Tsar and as a result he was assainated. Multiple strikes and protests and mutinies were crushed. Then Lenin came back in and helped stir revolution. I am oversimplifying this a lot, but it helps prove my point in a brief space. Basically, the Bolsheviks, the most extreme socialists of the socialist movements in Russia at the time (remember, the first post tsar government in Russia wasn't socialist, it was the Kerensky government). In fact, the first of the socialist government elected in Russia weren't the Bolsheviks, they were the Socialists Revolutionaries (they were democratic Agraian socialists) followed by the mensheviks (less extreme communists, as far as I understand them they were kinda extreme classical soc Dems, they wanted to use social democracy to facilitate communism) and then the Bolsheviks. But Lenin didn't like that election so he overturned it.

Anyways, history lesson aside, the point is that in Russia, during a time of economic uncertainty and fear, people turned towards increasingly authoritarian movements. Sure, the majority wasn't necessarily in favor of the authoritarian movement (the Bolsheviks lost the election remember) but they were legitimized and had some support.

We can see similar trends in Germany and Italy. The NSDP at most had like 33% of the vote in actual democratic elections (feel free to correct me on that figure, going off memory). I'm sure you will notice, that's not a majority. But it didn't matter. People wrre scared, multiple failed communist revolutions had happened, the Germans lost the war and felt cheated by the treaty, oh and of course the economy collapsed because guess what? Global depression. So, in those times of fear and increasing number of people turned towards conspiracy theories about Jews, romani, and socialists ""who stabbed Germany in the back"" (this stabbed in the back myth is a key component of Nazi ideology). This is a conspiracy theory. This time about Jews and communists (to the Nazis, the Jews were behind the Bolshevik revolution).

Political division, fears of communism and again disappointment over WW1 led to the rise of men like Mussolini in Italy. I am less familiar with fascist Italy than Russia or Germany, but we can see similar fears and conspiracies about socialist and communists.

Ultimately you can see conspiracy theories rising in times of discontent.



My point in this is that, belief in conspiracies leads to a desire for authoritarianism in order to ""crush the people causing all our problems"". Russia did it, Germany did it, Japan did it, etc.

We can see these same trends in action now in much of the west. Conspiracies like qanon and the big lie are our ""stabbed in the back"", (trump would have won if not for election fraud by Democrats and elite pedophiles). Trump as our savior from elite pedophiles? Sounds a lot like older conspiracy theories that have been associated with authoritarian regimes of old 


So then, how do we solve this? There have been proposals to address the theories themselves but personally I think that misses the point. People only believe in these theories because of that fear and insecurity. It serves to magnify existing biases and prejudices. Sure, social media helps spread this stuff faster and wider but it isn't the root issue.

The solution to this is establishing security for people, economic particularly but also health (cause of COVID) and defense wise (see 9/11 truthers). Fundamentally, logical arguments don't get people out of conspiracies, this has been shown time and time again. Why? Because they are rooted in fear and identity, not logic. The insecurity drives the theory.

What do you think of my analysis? What specific policies are you thinking to solve this?

Regulation of social media, fox news and OAN, de radicalization programs, are stop gap measures to paper over the real root issue. Can they help? Sure. But the issue doesn't go away until we solve that fundamental problem. The solution is long term economic security.

Explaining the Marxist methodology (Wall Of Text),Liberal,4,snlq3l,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/snlq3l/explaining_the_marxist_methodology_wall_of_text/,4,"Marxism is not an ideology to be implemented, but a mode of analysis of capitalism which suggests that the inexorable tendency of capitalism is towards its abolition by a global propertyless working class.

From *The Holy Family*:

> It is not a question of what this or that proletarian, or even the proletariat as a whole, may imagine for the moment to be the aim. It is a question of what the proletariat actually is and what it will be compelled to do historically as the result of this being.

Marx was consistent about this. From *The German Idellogy*:

> Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.

And from his letter to Arnold Ruge, written when he was twenty five:

> Nothing prevents us, therefore, from lining our criticism with a criticism of politics, from taking sides in politics, i.e., from entering into real struggles and identifying ourselves with them. **This does not mean that we shall confront the world with new doctrinaire principles and proclaim: Here is the truth, on your knees before it! It means that we shall develop for the world new principles from the existing principles of the world. We shall not say: Abandon your struggles, they are mere folly; let us provide you with true campaign-slogans. Instead, we shall simply show the world why it is struggling, and consciousness of this is a thing it must acquire whether it wishes or not.**

What the Marxist does, therefore, is analyze the prevailing system to see in what direction it is tending. Marx believed that there were certain innate and predictable tendencies within the capitalist mode of production which would lead to certain inevitable outcomes.

Part of the problem with Marxism - indeed, possibly the main problem with Marxism as a historical set of theories promulgated by Marx - is that Marx's own writings on this subject are scattershot, and his predictions spread out among responses to other philosophers and analyses of then-current world events. I am going to attempt to condense most of the relevant anticipatory/predictive writings of Marx here; I think they tally well with the direction that the world is visibly heading in today.

Marx's most expansive description of the future world revolution comes from *The German Ideology*, an early work written in 1844. The following text constitutes the meat of his prediction:

> This “alienation” (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. **For it to become an “intolerable” power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity “propertyless,” and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development**. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise **bcause without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the “propertyless” mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones**. Without this, (1) **communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples “all at once” and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism.** Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers – the utterly precarious position of labour – power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life – presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a “world-historical” existence. World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.

Marx states that there are requirements are necessary for the world revolution:

1. Capitalism must have globalized the whole world, and - this is essential - have made individuals ""*world-historical*"". This implies a high degree of development in communications and information technology from Marx's day, which we will again address soon.

2. Capitalism must have created a ""propertyless mass"" of wage laborers on a global scale. In Marx's time, 1844, this was not yet completely true - outside of Western Europe and North America, pre-and-proto-capitalist conditions prevailed everywhere. This is, however, true today -- and the Western middle-class seems to be in the early stages of being rendered ""propertyless"" via a process Marx terms ""immiseration"", which we'll address momentarily.

To the first point, Marx consistently rejected the presupposition of later Marxists like Mao, Lenin, Castro etc. that a legitimate anti capitalist revolution could occur in underdeveloped, proto-capitalist nations, where ""each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism"". He wrote the following on the subject in his *Conspectus Of Bakunin's Statism & Anarchy*:

> **A radical social revolution depends on certain definite historical conditions of economic development as its precondition. It is also only possible where with capitalist production the industrial proletariat occupies at least an important position among the mass of the people**. And if it is to have any chance of victory, it must be able to do immediately as much for the peasants as the French bourgeoisie, mutatis mutandis, did in its revolution for the French peasants of that time. A fine idea, that the rule of labour involves the subjugation of land labour! But here Mr Bakunin's innermost thoughts emerge. He understands absolutely nothing about the social revolution, only its political phrases. Its economic conditions do not exist for him. As all hitherto existing economic forms, developed or undeveloped, involve the enslavement of the worker (whether in the form of wage-labourer, peasant etc.), he believes that a radical revolution is possible in all such forms alike. Still more! He wants the European social revolution, premised on the economic basis of capitalist production, to take place at the level of the Russian or Slavic agricultural and pastoral peoples, not to surpass this level [...] The will, and not the economic conditions, is the foundation of his social revolution.

So it follows that for Marx the revolution will not occur in precapitalist nations. But Marx's revolution requires an exceedingly high degree of communication and coordination between capitalist nations -- and here we look to his posthumously-pubkished set of notebooks, the *Grundrisse*, wherein Marx anticipates the emergence of something like the contemporary information economy (he was familiar with early computers via the Victorian inventor Charles Babage):

> Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. **The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process...**

> ... But, once adopted into the production process of capital, the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses, whose culmination is the machine, or rather, an automatic system of machinery (system of machinery: the automatic one is merely its most complete, most adequate form, and alone transforms machinery into a system), set in motion by an automaton, a moving power that moves itself; this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, **so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages.**

Marx anticipates a data-driven information age that can produce ""world-historical"" individuals on a global scale.

Finally, there is the concept of immiseration - the processes inherent to capitalism which reduce the vast majority of humanity into a state of ""propertylessness"". To whit, this does **not** mean abject poverty - as Marx noted, mass absolute impoverishment would simply reproduce the "" filthy"" business of existence. Rather, the working class, globalised and interconnected, must be reduced to a level rentier status, where most of the necessities of life are directly provided by the employer and rented, without the existence of intermediary strata, which the capitalists must transit to buttress their falling rate of profit: globalised corporate hegemony on a maximum level.",1644330978.0

Progressive Democrat Erica Smith has already won several state-level elections in a rural district that represents a mix of conservative liberal counties. Several counties in her district went for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and for Trump in 2016. She hopes to be a trailblazer in the Democratic field, to prove how progressive policies can appeal to conservative people. 

People respond when their needs are being met, and when they are being heard. Facts and data are a bipartisan language that can improve people’s lives. The number of Americans without access to high speed broadband internet is so nebulous nobody has a concrete number, it’s anywhere from 21 to 42 million people, according to government and independent sources. Broadband was important before, and a necessity in a post-COVID world. 

17.5% of America’s rural areas have a population aged 65 or older, compared to the average of 13.5% in urban areas. These are some of America’s most vulnerable people, yet we see unprecedented rates of rural hospitals closing. America’s elderly deserve better, and while we understand that it is becoming more difficult to run a profitable rural hospital, healthcare is a human right and the government should step in and fill the gap.

This made me think of the migrants that come to the United States from Latin America and vote for the same policies that ruined the country where they came from. I used to think that maybe it was possible do something like educate them somehow or something to stop them from doing this. Or that for whatever reason immigrants would one day stop doing this.  But now I think maybe I was being too naive for thinking that. Will the majority of them still vote the same regardless of what we do, and will that always be the case no matter where in the world a mass migration of people fleeing from their county takes place? I do not support mass migration by the way. What are your opinions on all of this?

I probably wouldn’t have an issue if we seized $7 billion worth of heroin... but this is just wrong. On so many levels. 
It sets an awful precedent and sends the wrong message to other less than stable regimes. 

Why couldn’t they keep the reserves at the Fed until a legitimate government was in place? Why not limit access to the funds, not allowing transfer out but allowing the funds to be used for currency stabilizing operations? If the Taliban is not the legitimate government, how can we take these funds and earmark them for payout of lawsuits against the Taliban? What gives us the right to seize another nation’s legally acquired reserves in the first place? 

I know our use of the financial system to wreck countries is nothing new, but it deeply saddens me that these actions don’t receive more scrutiny. Bad actors always find ways around the measures and the people suffer. In corrupt states,  people aren’t going to rebel against the bad actors or vote them out of office, so economic warfare isn’t a means to an end. It’s an end in and of itself and it’s cruel.

Positioned on the centre-right of Singaporean politics, the PAP is ideologically [socially conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism) and [economically liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberalism). The party generally favours [free-market economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market), having turned [Singapore's economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Singapore) into one of the world's freest and most open,[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-15) but has at times engaged in [state interventionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism) reminiscent of [welfare capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_capitalism) policies. Socially, it supports [communitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_communitarianism) and [civic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_nationalism), with the cohesion of the country's main ethnic groups of [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Singaporeans), [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Malay) and [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean_Indian) into a united [Singaporean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singaporean) national identity forming many of its policies.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-16) On foreign policy, it favours maintaining a strong and robust military, serving as an indispensable guarantor of the country's continued independence with its strategic position for international [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_finance) and [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade).[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-MindefApr2005-18)

The [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) practised by the PAP during its first few decades in power was of a pragmatic kind as characterised by the party's rejection of [nationalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalisation). According to [Chan Heng Chee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Heng_Chee), by the late 1970s the intellectual credo of the government rested explicitly upon a philosophy of self-reliance, similar to the [rugged individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugged_individualism) of the [American brand of capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_model). Despite this, the PAP still claimed to be a [socialist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_party), pointing out its regulation of the private sector, activist intervention in the economy and social policies as evidence of this.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-69) In 1976, the PAP resigned from the [Socialist International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_International) after the [Dutch Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Netherlands)) had proposed to expel the party due to its shift in ideology.[\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party#cite_note-70)

For instance, in his Liberty Con remarks, Bryan Caplan claimed Singapore was one of the closest countries to the capitalist ideal.

It is true of course that Singapore has a market economy. But it’s also true that, in Singapore, the state owns a huge amount of the means of production.

Bio

Soilih was born into a comorian family in the town of Mahajanga Madagascar on January 7th 1937 and spent most of his youth and early adulthood  on the island. during the 1960s he traveld to his family's ancestrial home of the Comoros Islands, where he worked various jobs for most of the 1960s. around 1970 he became involved in politics and developed a Socialist and anti-colonialist position, heavely infuenced by Maoism, He also renounced Islam and became an athiest during this time. He was opposed to the continued French colonialism on the Islands and campaigned against it. Soon after the islands became independent in 1975 he launched a coup against the established government and became the leader of Comoros. Folowing his rise to power Soilih held a referendum on whether the people wanted him in power wich go a yes vote of around 60%, following this he began to implement Socialist and progressive policies and sought to modernise the country and make it as self sustaining as possible. Amoung the polices implemented by Soilih were nationalisation of industry, legalisation of Canabis, the banning of tradtional ''extravigantly wasteful'' and expensive wedings and funerals, lowering of the voting age to 14 and challeges to Islamic power on the islands, eg. promoting girls not to wear veils. During the 70s Soilih formed his own verision of Mao's Red Guards called the 'Moissey.''

France was angerd at the Socialism being implemented in it's former coloney and covertly supported various coup attempts by reactionary and local Bourgoesie elements on the islands who also opposed Soilih. On May 13th 1978 A group of French Mercenary thugs led by infamous Right-wing neo-colonialist, and Anti-Communist Bob Denard, stormed the capital of the island, gunning down civilans and brave members of the Moissey who tried to form a desperate defence of the city. Soilih was captured, detained interrigated and ex-judically executred a few weeks later by the mercenaries who also had execute the few Socialists who had survived the coup. Denard then installed a pro-Capitalist and Pro-French ruler on the islands.

Was having a discussion with an anarcho-communist about market socialism. Would you add onto anything I said? Did I miss something? Both soc dems and market socs welcome to reply!,Liberal,51,t1rjup,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/t1rjup/was_having_a_discussion_with_an_anarchocommunist/,7,"Hi,

So I was having a discussion with an anarcho-communist about market socialism and they talked about the experience one of their friends had at a coop. They said the following:

>So,  in the case of my first friend, she was working in a cafe. I think they  had rent and possibly loans to pay back, I'm not sure. And ""business  rates"" to the council (basically a flat tax on every business based on  the size of their premises)  
>  
>The  big problem was competition, they were one cafe among several near the  city centre - including chains and small owners. Profit was always tight  in these and none of them make megabucks. But the coop made less profit  
>  
>Firstly,  some staff were dead weight but it was too awkward to fire them.  Secondly, they found it hard to be ruthless (portions were too big for  the price). Third, as part of their funding, they had to agree to buy  from other coops. That meant some of the money went up the chain.  Actually, to the warehouse my other friend worked at where you had to be  friends with the right people to actually get a decent wage. They paid  better, but it was very exclusive  
>  
>If  there was more competition then it would be easier on the cafe, but the  warehouse staff would then be on minimum wage. Even if there were more  coops, people would still eat at the cheapest one - the one that paid  least :/

I thought it was an interesting take, but here was my response. Would you add anything? Is there something I missed?

>Right so there are a couple solutions  to this issue. If your coop is full of deadweight staff, and you care  about getting decent pay, you can either fire them, or you can move to  another coop. The whole point of competition is that it basically drags  profit down. This is true even in a capitalist system. By dragging down  profits it drags down prices. If you can make more money by switching to  another coop or industry, the rational thing to do is to make the  switch.  
>  
>What you are describing to  me just sounds like a poorly run coop. Competition would weed these  out. If you aren't charging enough for the portions you give out, then  like, either give out fewer portions or charge more for it. Coops that  are well run will see higher accounting profits. This is fairly normal  for businesses of all types.  
>  
>Again,  you're making the mistake of thinking in terms of wages. Coops do more  than that. They pay in terms of profit as well (employees each get a  share of all profits). This is why capitalists are so rich, they take a  large share of profits and give a small portion to workers in the form  of wages. All the profits going to the capitalist go to the worker  instead. The wage is basically an insurance mechanism to ensure everyone  gets paid even in rough times. The real money comes in % profit. So  perhaps the warehouse staff would be on minimum wage, but it wouldn't  matter because they would be getting a higher share of profits, and thus  more money overall because profits wouldn't be going to some distant  owner. Effectively their wage would be higher, even if on paper it  isn't. The income would be greater as the coop as a whole is trying to  get its members to be rich as possible.  
>  
>I  tend to disagree with the viewpoint that if you treat people well, you  go under. I think there's a balance. Again, coops must compete for  workers, and the workers themselves get a say in how it is run. If  people don't like shitty conditions, they can vote to change it. They  can't do that in a capitalist firm.",1645861776.0
The words of Max Eastman(American socialist writer) as he realizes that thanks to private property and only private property that humanity can truly be free:,Conservative,65,rhzwia,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/rhzwia/the_words_of_max_eastmanamerican_socialist_writer/,30,"""It seems obvious to me now--though I have been slow, I must say, in coming to the conclusion--that the institution of private property is one of the main things that have given man that limited amount of free and equalness that Marx hoped to render infinite by abolishing this institution. Strangely enough Marx was the first to see this. He is the one who informed us, looking backwards, that the evolution of private capitalism with its free market had been a precondition for the evolution of all our democratic freedoms. It never occurred to him, looking forward, that if this was so, these other freedoms might disappear with the abolition of the free market.""

Do you support measures taken or will be taken by governments to prevent the spread of this resistant variant or do you have opposite ideas? I have observed high amount of skepticism towards the virus and opposition to measures in rightist/conservative circles around me, does your society have skeptical conservative groups too?

How to argue with your conservative relatives:,Liberal,4,rsh58w,alltheleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/rsh58w/how_to_argue_with_your_conservative_relatives/,3,"This is what I've learned from personal experience and watching other people on how to convince conservative (and libertarian) family members that your positions are the best ones. This is a U.S. based topic, but I think a lot of these tips can also apply to other countries. If you think of anything major I missed, I'll add it in with edits.

1. Optics. This is the biggest one that stems into most of the other tips in this post. Winning a debate is unfortunately not about being correct, but looking most like you're making the better point. Whoever looks better is going to win. If something you're doing is correct, but it's clearly not going over well, move on to something else. And if you find something that resonates with people, keep going.
2. Have evidence behind what you say. By this I do not mean that you should bring documents to thanksgiving dinner, or have sources up on your phone before a conversation starts. But, you should have a couple of important bits of peer-reviewed evidence that you have memorized, and that you can find easily on the internet in just a minute or two.
3. Never get mad. This is EXTREMELY important. Getting annoyed is totally fine, since it can make you feel more passionate and genuine, but you never want to get fully angry. First of all, when a person is angry it subconsciously makes the people around them think they're less reasonable, which looks bad on you. Second of all, when going up against a conservative or when you have conservative people watching you, you REALLY do not want to look like the stereotypical ""triggered liberal."" This is a death sentence, as then they can scapegoat themselves and focus more on making fun of you for being mad over thinking about WHY you're mad.What's even better is if THEY get mad. If they get mad, it makes THEM look unreasonable. Now we'll get into this more later, but right then is the PERFECT time to call them ""Trigged"" or a ""Snowflake.""
4. Don't look too extreme. Now I want to be clear: There isn't anything inherently wrong with BEING radical, but you never want to make it SEEM that way to the person you're talking to and the people around you. You can still absolutely seem like a leftist, in fact, that's what I'd recommend, since if you do well it makes it seem like leftism is the best ideology. But, if you start out too strong, with things like Eat The Rich, people are going to be inherently biased against you from the beginning. Talk about raising the Minimum Wage and a 35 hour work week instead (I know those things aren't considered particularly ""leftist"" in most first world countries, but they are in the U.S.).If you want to show a more radical side, you can talk to a person you convinced a bit later and be a bit more specific and open about what you think.
5. Another big one: Use their language against them. Let's say your opponent says they believe in freedom, something most conservatives like to say they do. They then use this to justify lowering taxes on billionaires and removing the minimum wage. Then, you can agree with them. ""I also believe in Freedom. The only problem is, giving bosses the ability to lower the minimum wage actually makes the country less free, since people can get forced into working longer hours for almost no pay just to buy bread."" Then, later in the argument when LGBT issues inevitably get brought up, you can mention Freedom again. ""Oh, I love freedom. I think every adult should be free to marry any other adult they want to. I thought you believed in freedom too, so why do you oppose this?"" This shows people the fundamental contradiction in Conservative thought, and also looks really, really good on your image. You can also do this with the whole ""Facts over Feelings"" thing by citing trans positive reliable studies, ""Stop the Steal"" to reference the January Six coup, and say that you want to ""Make America Great Again"" by reinstating the economic policies that led to a golden age in the 1960s, like a low cost of living and highly exponential income tax. ONE VERY IMPORTANT BIT OF NUANCE: In general, don't bring up these catchphrases before they do. This makes it look like you're strawmanning them, which to be honest, you kind of would be. There are a few exceptions, like you can bring up Make America Great Again if they're a known Trump supporter, but if it's pretty much ambiguous on whether or not they would use the phrase, don't bring it up.
6. Humor in large groups. This is one pretty much just for the dinner table or the living room, when there's at least two people besides you in the room. Don't try to make a joke unless you are pretty certain it will go over well with at least one bystander. Jokes are one of the best ways to pass of something that a person wouldn't normally agree with as something they like. It's like a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down. This is why so many Nazis become Nazis through memes, although for them it's sugar on top of a bunch of sewage. Anyway, if you can make a joke that a person or two will genuinely find funny and will also understand the point of, that can help a fair bit.
7. Keep it simple. Only bring up things that, for the most part, everyone will understand. More niche political terms aren't usually good in family arguments. Don't go too intricate with what you talk about, if you do that then you'll have to spend more time explaining what you just said over actually saying things. Most of all, you want your arguments to make sense both linguistically and intuitively.The exception to this is if somebody asks you a specific question. If the topic is pretty much over and somebody asks, ""Well then what IS the difference between Socialism and Communism?"" then you can go, ""I'm glad you asked. Here you go:""

That's all I've got for now. If you have any more, I'll add 'em in.",1640911971.0
Here's how we fix a great deal of economic issues in America with just a single tax,Liberal,10,qu9js2,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/qu9js2/heres_how_we_fix_a_great_deal_of_economic_issues/,1,"One of the biggest problems we face today is in regards to housing affordability.

To understand why, you need to look at price elasticity which falls into two categories: supply elasticity and demand elasticity. Demand elasticity has to do with how quickly demand will change in regards to price. For example, healthcare has an inelastic demand, much moreso than leisure. However, in a competitive market, that doesn't really matter. The problem comes when such a market is captured by one or a handful of providers. This can easily occur in a market with an inelastic supply because new providers can't easily provide more of that good. This is particularly the case with land which is about as close to inelastic on both sides as it gets. We need land to live and work on but land is a fixed good. Furthermore, not just any land will do because land in the middle of Alaska isn't as well desired as land in Manhattan or San Francisco.

There are three factors of production.

Labor: Effort by man to make or do something

Land: Anything natural such as natural resources or land itself

Capital: Anything made by man

Now the issue I take with this setup is that natural resources have more in common with capital than with land itself. Natural resources can't be made but they can be discovered. Even if it's non renewable, we can keep on discovering new reserves (that's why peak oil never happened). Furthermore, resources can be used more efficiently.

Land: Anything in fixed supply in which value can only be added through speculation. Examples include land, intellectual property, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and even geostationary orbits.

Capital: Everything else, mainly that which can be created through investment.

In the late 19th century, a man by the name of Henry George wrote a book called *Progress and Poverty*. In it, he sought to answer a question. The industrial revolution had given the US and UK so much wealth. Why then was there still poverty? Henry George's answer was that the ownership of land was the main culprit. His reasoning was that people (mainly those of affluence) were buying up land and gaining leverage over others. All of that investment in land left less left over for labor and capital. It wasn't just an affront to economic equality but also efficiency because land speculation hoards land from being used.

Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).

Henry George pointed out just how people can profit from land speculation without contributing to society.

>Take now... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: ""Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city—in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will in ten years, interest be any higher?"" He will tell you, ""No!"" ""Will the wages of the common labor be any higher...?"" He will tell you, ""No the wages of common labor will not be any higher..."" ""What, then, will be higher?"" ""Rent, the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession."" And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the *lazzaroni* of Naples or the *leperos* of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.

To fix this, George proposed a land value tax. It's similar to a property tax except it doesn't tax the whole property, just the land on which it sits. This would deter land speculation and incentivize land owners to use the land as efficiently as possible. It also wouldn't penalize upgrading property because it would only affect land. A whole movement started around it called the single tax movement. This movement competed with socialism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But for whatever reason, georgism died out. It's now seeing a slow revival in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which was caused by land speculation. Georgism saw sympathy from people like Albert Einstein, FDR, Hellen Keller, and Winston Churchill. Convincing people that this will be a good idea will most certainly be an uphill battle but enough people are talking about it, it can start a new conversation because we can't achieve the LVT if nobody's heard of it.

And the concept predates George. Thomas Paine in *Agrarian Justice* believed in implementing an LVT in addition to an inheritance tax of 10%. 2/3 of the revenue would go to people over 50 (life expectancy back then) with the remaining third in the form of a basic income.

Adam Smith was likewise very critical of land rent (that's where the phrase ""rent-seeking"" comes from).

He saw the LVT as the best way for the government to raise revenue since an LVT did not impose deadweight loss on the economy.

Importance of Civil Liberties,Liberal,9,sr7qtr,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sr7qtr/importance_of_civil_liberties/,7,"For  a communist party operating within a bourgeois state, the defence of  civil liberties (or democratic rights) is important, not just because  civil liberties make people's lives more pleasant in the short term, but  because civil liberties facilitate the work of the communist party: it  can publish and distribute its press, recruit openly, be less fearful of  imprisonment, hold meetings openly, etc. if there is a high or  moderately high degree of civil liberty in that bourgeois state. If the  communist party's work is easier, then presumably revolution, the  objective of the communist party, becomes more likely. Thus civil  liberties are important to revolution.

I  am looking for support within the Marxist canon -- preferably by Marx,  Engels, or Lenin, but also by other Marxists -- for the above  proposition that civil liberty within the bourgeois state is important.

For  example, Karl Marx, in \*Class Struggles in France,\* Part II, says that  the constitution of the bourgeois democratic republic sanctions the  social power of the bourgeoisie while withdrawing the political  guarantees of this power, forcing it ""into democratic conditions, \*which  at every moment help the hostile forces to victory and jeopardise the  very foundations of bourgeois society.\*""

I am hoping to find other textual support of this kind.  Any references would be appreciated.

I see the end result of r/antiwork as the result of contemporary anarchist organization in practice. As it was created, and apparently moderated by, anarchists who aren’t too familiar with what an effective socialist movement should look like. 

The subreddit garnered a lot of attention and followers, but at a cost of the integrity of its movement and the effectiveness of its followers, due to the decentralized and uneducated base that largely misguided the movement as a whole. 

Without a more central structure, consisting of those educated on the subjects and principles of the movement, democratically guiding by those same principles, resulted in the movement being taken over by those inconsistent with the interests of its followers. 

With a decentralized structure with nothing guiding it, it was taken advantage of by ignorant and malice members who, even quicker than the movement grew, destroyed it completely. 

What does the aftermath of this look like now? What are the consequences to a misguided and uneducated member base? A complete takeover and misrepresentation of the principles and ideas that align with the interests of its members. Most users find themselves no more aligned with each other as they were before, with so many internal arguments about even the most basic principles they should be advocating for. No one is educated on the topics, misinformation flies around quickly, and opportunists have now taken over a large amount of the uneducated member base. r/WorkReform is ran by a literal Bank executive, who will surely misguide the members of the movement who were seeking an alternative. 

These are the issues with a decentralized movement focused on the lowest bar possible for acceptance and advocacy. 

I believe we must learn from this, and develop a contemporary socialist movement based on, first and foremost, educating its members effectively. A well educated member base is a robust member base that is much harder to take advantage of or to, in this case, completely destroy the movement entirely. The next socialist movement should also have effective and educated leaders who are competent, elected by an educated and robust community of members who align with the interests of those members. Leaders who can help advocate for the movement more effectively publicly and showcase to those interested in change that there is a place for them. 

R/antiwork was contemporary anarchist organization in practice. We must learn from its mistakes and develop past them. 

I’m interested in hearing how other socialists have interpreted these events, and if any anarchists out there have any solutions to these events.",1643324536.0

If you have a voice use it!

The 1933 Nazi book burnings sparked response from anti-Fascist organizations, Jewish groups, and writers in the United States. American literary organizations provided aid to the rising number of German emerge writers in response to the crisis.

KEY FACTS

* 1  
American newspapers nearly unanimously condemned the book burnings. While some responded with ridicule, others forecast the impending “dark age.”
* 2  
On May 10, 1933, the same day as the book burnings in Germany, nearly 100,000 people marched in New York City for more than six hours to protest events in Germany and the burning of books
* 3  
American author Helen Keller—known for her socialist views and one of whose books was burned—wrote an open letter to German students, affirming the enduring power of ideas against tyranny.

Students will be so indoctrinated by certain schools that any school giving a better education will appear to be lies and propaganda to them, and they'll send their kids to the same school they went to. Those who go to more legitimate schools will have their options more open, so over time more and more people will go to the brainwashing schools. Any ideology can turn towards authoritarianism with enough blind adherents.

\- Privately-owned media will be the same way.

\- Private security forces will realize that it's easier to protect a contiguous area than a discontinuous one, and mark off territory, forming local monopolies. This'll have the added effect of giving the customers in their territory little choice in who to hire.

\- Somebody has to manufacture the guns. As weapons technology advances, the latest weapons will become harder for individuals and small firms to make (or maintain, or supply). Every Podunk village used to have a local swordsmith working independently. How far away is your local tank smith? Can you make anything in your back yard to compete with a cruise missile? A billion-dollar company sure can.

\- Vertical integration. Depending on another company for yours to operate is a fault.  Defense companies will want to merge with weapons manufacturers to save money on guns. They'll also want to own clinics for when their officers get injured on duty. Rental properties will buy out defense companies to defend their property and enforce evictions. Schools will want to merge with rental properties to provide student housing, and with media companies to control their students' exposure.

\- Any company looking to use aggression to get its way will seek out people without protection, or with insufficient protection. Somebody considered it worthwhile to form a state the first time. They will again. Especially if they control the weapons supply, the ""security"" forces, the land people live on, the water/food/medicine supply, and/or the education system.

\- You can't just own a part of, say, a river. What you do upriver impacts water supply downriver. What you do downriver impacts trade access upriver.

\- Automation will eliminate unskilled jobs, and the cost of quality education will eliminate skilled labor. Why do you think we have a labor shortage and a job shortage at the same time right now? Unemployed, uneducated people with little to do and a grudge against the people denying them food and healthcare won't be very peaceful. If there's one thing capitalism is good at producing, it's socialists and communists.

I’m gonna present some arguments against capitalism made by communists in the past. Don’t be too harsh, these are just honest topics. 

1. Capitalism will inevitably collapse due to its own conditions and contradictions.

Apparently the left likes to say capitalism will just wither away and die out basically because of the state having too much power. Or.. there’ll be a revolution (which in my opinion is silly to say for a communist because they never work for anything and wait)

2. The only way workers can get rid of alienation is by owning the means of production. 

This made sense. Workers own how their products get controlled but a capitalist response I once heard was you can just buy stocks (pretty vague) if anyone would like to add on that.

3. Capitalism has a false relationship with meritocracy

Communists say only in their regime hard work gets rewarded. 

4. Taxing the rich

>If bill gates got taxed 70% of his net worth the healthcare system would only be benefited for 16 days only.

5. Capitalism leads to starvation, homelessness and extreme levels of inflation and unemployment.

6. Communism is a prosperous society where you have a planned economy that benefits everyone",1645479377.0

EB mostly ignored the fact that lots of cooperatives offer symbolic shares. Thus a share might be worth $1000 dollars or some relatively low amount.

2. EB did not consider the distinction between per capita and net costs, namely that while per capita costs may be higher, net costs would be lower because of lower employee turnover. 

3. Let’s assume this is a concern. Wouldn’t we expect this to be confirmed by empirical data? If so, why is it that cooperatives have on average the same or larger numbers of employees and grow at about the same rates?

4. Vis a vis access to capital, I think this is really only a concern in North America. EB seemed to totally brush over places like Emilia romagna where cooperatives 3% of profits to federations towards funds that then provide equity investment services.

Libertarians make the argument against welfare or benefits of sorts and I'm just curious how exactly that would work out. Would it improve things or make them simply worse. Discuss.,Conservative,2,su3fvu,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/su3fvu/libertarians_make_the_argument_against_welfare_or/,40,"Living in the UK we have a welfare system known as benefits and while it does help people in need it also gets taken advantage of big time so my personal opinion is that welfare should be a thing but it should be massively regulated and more strict than what it already is. As to prevent people exploiting it. 

Are people out there who are in desperate need and need that financial support. Whether they're jobless, have or developed a disability or perhaps they're parents who do work but are struggling financially to look after their children. 

Because the simple fact is that if these people don't get money somehow they're going to be thrown into extreme levels of poverty and endured homelessness. And as it's well documented it's a lot harder to get back up on your feed once you're made homeless. 

One underlying issue with the benefit system is that due to the fact it gets exploited by lowlifes that means the people who desperately need the support aren't getting it due to how much of a money drain these other leeches are being. 

&#x200B;

However, I've noticed that it appears to be a Libertarian belief to abolish welfare entire and I think I understand the premise behind it. Making us less independent of the government for funds and establishing some sort of independence but I find it somewhat difficult to agree with. 

I don't like government as much as the next joe but abolishing welfare entirely just seems like a sure fine way to throw potentially millions of people (depending where you live) into extreme poverty. 

Not sure how having an increased homelessness, child mortality and increased starvation figures would benefit us as a society. 

Sure the government would certainly have loads more money for other things like committing war crimes in third world nations but how would this benefit us as a society. 

&#x200B;

I'm not too sure how the US system works so you'll have to create your own plan for that but in terms of the UK what I think I'd do is I'd abolish or massively regulate unemployment benefits as that's a system that is always exploited. 

Believe it's been changed in which you have to meet a certain quota of jobs applied for and you have to take an interview from the first job you get regardless if you like it or not. 

But what often happens is that they apply for these jobs, get the interview, either purposely fuck over the interview or they'll get the job and purposely do bad shit in order to get fired. 

Now what I'd do is if you get a job you have to remain at said job for a certain set of time. If you happen to lose said job then you must wait an entire month or maybe more if I'm being an asshole from when you lost your job to when you can apply for unemployment. 

This way it prevents folks from just purposely getting fired from their job just to get back on benefits as they'll be without money and income for 1 or 2 months. It'd be a sure fine way to lose money if you kept trying this shit. 

Folks who are on unemployment for genuine reasons will find the first job they can get and stay in said job, those folks who are good won't be on unemployment for long thereby reducing overall cost of that benefit system while maximising the amount of people going to return. 

&#x200B;

My hope is that this would save much more money thus allowing the people who desperately need benefits to actually receive said benefits. As for disabilities it's tricky but again in the UK people exploit this as well. 

Suppose the simple solution to this would be a monitored health check, not just a Doctor's note or some shit, as much as that would suck it would essentially weed out the people who don't have genuine disabilities or at least if they do have a disability we can determine how major or mild it is and see how that affects their ability to work. As often enough they're still perfectly capable of working. 

Single or struggling parents you don't really need much to prove. If both parents are working and they're struggling financially then it's quite obvious that they need help so hopefully with my suggest changes said parents can get the support they need. 

I'd much rather my tax money go towards the wellbeing and development of raising a child than the dregs of society who leech of the good people of this nation. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, that's my opinion of welfare and benefits and while I agree with people needing help it's so fundamentally flawed that it's in need of major reforms. 

I don't believe wiping out welfare entirely would benefit people or society as a whole, I just believe it will only create more problems than what you're trying to solve. 

But maybe you can give an argument as to why removing welfare entirely would be beneficial for society.",1645037975.0

Some naive bull I wrote,Conservative,0,skmzi7,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/skmzi7/some_naive_bull_i_wrote/,35,"This isn’t going to be some anger-fuelled rant about how the richest 1% of the world has as much as the entire rest of the world combined. That’s capitalism for you, and as much as it’s not fair, it’s what the majority of the West is built on, and it would take far too much restructuring of our entire culture to change quickly enough. No, this is an appeal to those 1% – and really, to anyone with the means necessary – to use what you have wisely. To let money be what saves humanity, rather than what dooms it.

Many of us feel powerless in our lives; powerless to change, powerless to be heard, powerless to make a difference. In our society, money *is* power, and those of us with a mortgage, or rent, or anything that throws doubt on the security of our financial future feel trapped in the grind to dig our way out. Sometimes you spend so long in this grind that you don’t realize you’ve made it out, and you keep grinding away anyway. So, I’m asking you to reflect on what you have. Do you have everything you want? Or more specifically, do you have everything you want *that has a price*?

Go on, make a list. Write down everything that you want – that you really *want* out of life, not just that new DVD player or that nice ring that will replace the equally nice but not quite as novel ring. Now take a look at the list. If you already have everything on that list that can be bought, ask yourself what you need your money for.

I’m willing to bet that one of the most common answers here will be “For a loved one” – maybe for a son or daughter, maybe for a husband or wife – to leave it to them once you’re gone. And I would ask, *why wait?* Why not give it to them now? Perhaps you haven’t given it to them already because you don’t feel like they need it. Sure, if they were penniless, you’d help them out, but they’re stable. They have their own life.

And so, you keep your wealth because you don’t know what else to do with it. Maybe you’re afraid that giving your wealth away and leaving your loved ones with less will make them angry at you, that quiet anger which stews for years. In which case: talk to them, openly and honestly. Language is the great evolutionary advantage we have as humans – well, that and opposable thumbs – so don’t squander it. Use it.

If you’ve reached this point of whatever the heck this is, then maybe you figure you do have wealth to spare. It might not be much; it might be a lot. And now, bearing that in mind, I’ll get to the crux of my argument.

We know the dangers of global warming. (Yes, this was an eco-friendly letter all along, haha!) We know how devastating it will be if it continues, but it will take a tremendous amount of effort to stop it. It would take half the world’s governments to even put a dent in it. And so we feel powerless to stop it.

But, as I mentioned earlier, money *is* power in the West. Use your power. Invest in green energy companies, lobby your government to implement better public transport, fund a scientist’s research into more efficient electronics, build a bunch of solar panels and put them in the Sahara, buy some of the Amazon to protect it from deforestation (@Jeff Bezos, this one has your name written all over it, I mean come on, that’s marketing genius) … although maybe do some research first, because heck knows how feasible any of that is.

I have no doubt that humans will survive whatever apocalypse we create. We may be pests, but we’re bloody persistent. But we could save the whole of humanity, rather than just a few humans, not to mention millions of other species we haven’t even discovered yet. The world is an amazing place, and though it may not be where humanity ends, it is our home. Let’s make sure it stays that way.

Maybe you think this is all naïve garbage and isn’t how the world works. You’re probably right. You may also think that I’m trying to use you for your money, to save the world for me rather than doing anything myself. That’s most definitely true – I don’t have nearly enough money to make a difference on my own. But together, we have the power to make a difference. And that means we have the responsibility.

Tldr: people with money can help fight climate change, don't know why i thought that was revolutionary enough to post about, but there we go",1644005408.0

"""Why Joe Biden Gave Up on Covid"" (Biden administration's incompetent and neoliberal approach to the COVID-19 pandemic)",Liberal,0,ssbabk,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/ssbabk/why_joe_biden_gave_up_on_covid_biden/,24,"This is a really good discussion ([https://newrepublic.com/article/165053/biden-quits-covid-fight](https://newrepublic.com/article/165053/biden-quits-covid-fight)) from The New Republic about the Biden administration's mishandling of the pandemic. Some of the things it talks about are how the administration 1) failed to have a plan in place other than vaccination (despite the vaccine skepticism of a substantial portion of the population), 2) had the opportunity to restock the strategic national stockpile with masks and tests during the lull last year but declined to do so, and 3) was unable to foresee the possibility (read: epidemiological eventuality) of the development of another variant. These are all huge failures, especially considering the fact that Biden ran in large part on basic competence and ""following the science"".

I think the even more interesting things come in the latter half of the discussion, though, which points out that the person whose running the administration's whole pandemic response is Jeffrey Zients who has, ""...a background in private equity and management consulting, and under the Obama administration, he was known as the ambassador to the business community for the Obama administration."" Not only does he not have any scientific background, nor even any background it seems of managing scientific or medical projects, but he's plucked straight from the heart of the business community, which makes a lot of sense considering the administration's emphasis on getting back to work, even if it means taking obscene shortcuts (like not requiring a negative antigen or PCR test before returning after a measly 5 days of isolation). Some other things discussed in the latter half of the interview include the administration's shift from a rhetoric of collective effort to one of individual responsibility, as well the administration's misrepresentation of statistics, and burying of data, to buttress this narrative.

You can read or listen to the discussion, and it's definitely worth it to do either of those in their entirety, but I am including a few choice excerpts below for those who are interested.

**Excerpts:**

Melody: In January, the Biden administration released a plan, including invoking the Defense Production Act, in order to expand production of PPE, to expand vaccines, and pretty much anything that you might need during the pandemic. In May, mask manufacturers approached the administration saying, “Now that not everyone is masking, we have all these extra masks. Would you like to replenish the stockpile?” As far as I can tell, that went ignored. Similarly, in the fall, test manufacturers approached the administration and said, “We predict a surge coming around the holidays. Here’s how many tests you will need for every American to stay safe. This way you can send it to them. Do you want to start these contracts now?” The White House seems to have passed on those proposals. And now we have immense testing shortages.

…

Melody: Vice President Kamala Harris has said no one knew a variant was coming, and that’s why we were taken by surprise. If they had talked to any scientist, any immunologist, any microbiologist—everyone was saying, from December 2020, “We know this virus is going to evolve. We know it’s going to evolve to evade immunity, because there’s selective pressure now that some people have immunity from recovery and that people are getting vaccines. The virus that’s going to survive is going to be the kind that can evade immunity.” Everyone knew that. It was pretty clear that was going to happen. It’s clear that it probably will continue happening, even after omicron.

…

Melody: The other thing I want to point out about omicron being milder: Omicron, it seems, is milder when it comes to infecting lung tissue, but it can still infect your throat, your nose, and your other vital organs. It’s only seeming to have trouble replicating in the lungs. But what doctors are seeing more and more is diabetic ketoacidosis, which is when you have complications from diabetes. They’re seeing cardiac complications. They’re seeing all of these complications that were present before, when patients were on ventilators, that doctors had to treat, but now they’re just not on ventilators. That’s the main difference with omicron. The problem is you still need to go to the ICU if you’re having complications like that. So that’s kind of the tricky thing with saying omicron is milder.

In terms of what it means for hospitalization, our nurses, health care workers, janitors, cafeteria workers, and ambulance drivers are at a breaking point. This is going to have huge repercussions for our health in five or 10 years. More immediately, I’ve been getting calls for the past day or so from my family, who live in a state where crisis standards of care were just implemented, and they are saying, “At what point do I need to go to the hospital? I’m pretty sick. Will I even be seen?”

…

Alex: We were just talking to Melody Schreiber, in part comparing what President Joe Biden said he would do if elected president back in 2020 versus what his administration has done. I want to ask you, do you see a disparity between what Biden said his administration would do and what they are currently doing while in power?

Justin: Definitely. I think the clearest illustration of this is to look at the [pandemic response plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/National-Strategy-for-the-COVID-19-Response-and-Pandemic-Preparedness.pdf) that the Biden transition team developed and that they released on January 20, Inauguration Day. There were provisions—or plans, rather—to hire a Public Health Service Reserve Corps of 100,000 federal workers who would help with things like vaccination and testing, to massively increase testing capacity. There were a whole variety of proposals. There was never really an attempt to do most of these things.

Alex: And why do you think that is? I remember these plans, but what do you think happened?

Justin: What I think happened is two things: One, they got the first results for vaccine efficacy. The Pfizer results delivered back in, I think, November 2020 showed 95 percent efficacy against symptomatic disease, which was much higher than expected. The other thing that happened was simply that the political reality, or rather the political considerations, of corporate interests and profit conflicted with some of the most effective public health measures. So they were really planning on widespread vaccination bringing the pandemic down to very low levels of infection, where we could just go on about our lives as normal. That is certainly not what happened.

Alex: I want to get into the efficacy, politically and health-wise, of the vaccine-only approach. But first I want to continue talking about this disparity. The Biden administration and the Democratic Party’s promise was essentially, “Elect us, we will follow science and subject-matter experts, and scientists will be in charge of decision-making.” “We will listen to the experts” is one of the primary Democratic Party sales pitches. Have they followed through on that? Are health experts in charge of Biden administration policy?

Justin: No. Very easy one! Actually, Anthony Fauci was recently answering questions in the U.S. Senate, and a Republican senator asked, “Who is in charge of the federal Covid response?” The answer Fauci gave, which is the correct answer, is Jeffrey Zients. Zients is the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, the number one person driving Covid-response policy. He has a background in private equity and management consulting, and under the Obama administration, he was known as the ambassador to the business community for the Obama administration.

…

Justin: In the U.S., the CDC and White House have been saying this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated since, I think, July. They wanted to cast the pandemic in very individualistic terms. You can make the choice and opt out of the pandemic, or you can remain unvaccinated and have your health at risk. Let me be very clear here that vaccines reduce individual risk considerably. Unless you’re immunocompromised, you get a lot of protection from the vaccines. At the same time, the power of the vaccines has somewhat weakened due to waning immunity, and these variants are much more transmissible than the variants of the past. So while Fauci was claiming that 99 percent of people dying were unvaccinated, CDC’s actual data showed it was something around 18 percent of deaths were vaccinated people. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a bit of a lag in the data and about a third of the people dying are vaccinated.

…

Justin: The main tools that CDC, the White House, and media as well are speaking of are boosters, masks, and tests, especially rapid, take-home tests. There’s this idea that because these products exist, you can calibrate your behaviors based on your personal risk tolerance and choose which products to use when, and we’re not necessarily going to give you clear guidance. We’re not going to require them of you, and we’re not going to provide them to you.

Laura: An infuriating thing about hearing “we have the tools” is that the tools exist, OK, they’ve been invented. But we can’t get them. I tried to get tests over the holidays, and I luckily already had a supply of masks that I trust, N-95 masks. Those are out of stock where I was getting them now. So it feels like something that is technically true but on a practical level untrue.

Justin: I almost think it’s intentional. They want us to keep shopping, keep going to work, and not worry too much. We’ve had pretty explicit communication by multiple White House officials and the CDC that if you’re vaccinated and you get infected, you’re probably going to have a mild experience and you don’t have to worry about it. I think the reluctance to push for better masks or more aggressive testing is directly tied into that and also directly tied into this yearlong approach where they did not make the preparations where we could have the tools. There are shortages.

If every country in Europe maintained a SWF as large as Norway’s there’d be no private stocks left given Norway owns 1.3% of Europe’s stock market and only contains around 1.1% of Europe’s population.

First off, if you're running away from Regulation by moving to new locations, you're not actually free of Regulation.

The LINKE are even more Russia-phile, they actually support abandoning NATO, instead forming a new defensive alliance including Russia. Now, these are all widely known facts, and have been for a while. The left are not alone with this problem, the Christian Democrats have similarly strong ties to Russia, and the AfD are - like they usually are - even worse than all the other parties in this regard.

This issue has once again become apparent with the SPD rejecting weapon exports to Ukraine.
Sure, i could try and defend the SPD, saying that this issue is far less black-and-white than it seems. Many of the decisions regarding weapon exports to Ukraine have been met under the old government, and there are arguments against Germany sending weapons to Ukraine (for example based on Germany's more diplomatic approach to dealing with Russia, as well some of the regulations regarding weapons exports from Germany). I myself am kind of split on weapons exports to Ukraine, though now tending towards them. Olaf Scholz is saying he will heavily restrict trade with Russia if an invasion should happen, but frankly, i don't believe he would actually do so. This issue goes far beyond the current crisis. The SPD are far too close to Russia, and try to criticise them as little as possible.
I have never particularly liked Olaf Scholz, and the little confidence i had had in him is on the verge of vanishing. I am sure that this government will do a lot better than the previous one, but with the SPD acting like this, many structural issues can not be fixed.
It seems that whenever i have gained some respect for the SPD, they do
something like this, abandon all the values they have defended for over 150 years, and remind me again of why i support the Greens instead of them. The SPD are undoubtedly the party that have had more positive influence on Germany than any other. However there are things that I am sick of defending. The SPD are responsible for their poor performance in recent years, and this is one of the reason for it.

Australian Imperialist Torture in the Pacific

Full Citizenship Rights for Manus, Nauru Refugees!

In late November, Papua New Guinea (PNG) Navy officers and police stormed the recently closed Australian-operated Manus Island Detention Centre (MIDC), viciously beating refugee protesters who had refused to leave. Many were injured in the attack as police confiscated their phones, destroyed their few possessions and herded them onto buses for transportation to “alternative accommodation” in Lorengau, a small town on the remote, malaria-infested PNG island. Hundreds of refugees were relocated to the Lorengau camp, which is widely recognised as being unfit for human habitation. On top of the wretched living conditions, the refugees also fear for their safety following confrontations with and threats of violence by some within the small, mainly Melanesian local community.

The forcible removal of refugees followed a three-week stand-off in which refugees courageously refused Australian government demands that they accept “relocation.” The centre was formally closed on 31 October following a PNG Supreme Court ruling last year that the facility was illegal because it denied asylum seekers their liberty.

At the beginning of November electricity, running water, medicine and regular food supplies were cut off at the MIDC. PNG authorities also destroyed makeshift water catchments and threatened locals who assisted the refugees. Crammed into rooms and tents in unbearable heat and suffering from starvation, dehydration and the increasing threat of disease, the exhausted refugees demanded freedom in a safe environment. In response, the Australian Liberal/National Coalition government waged a systematic campaign of vilification, lies and cover-up. The stone-cold racist immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said that claims of violence against the protesters were “inaccurate and exaggerated.” Prime Minister Turnbull cheerily hailed the forced removal of the men to Lorengau.

Outrageously during the stand-off Turnbull rejected New Zealand's (NZ) offer to resettle 150 refugees because, he said, it would encourage “people smugglers."" While criticising Turnbull for not accepting the NZ offer, Labor leader Bill Shorten made it crystal clear where the ALP stands, declaring “Australia is not and must not be a resettlement option.”

The lives of refugees, many of whom have fled countries devastated by blood-drenched wars waged by the U.S. and Australian imperialism, are of no consequence to the bourgeois statesmen and women who inhabit the Australian parliament. Labor and Liberal/National Coalition governments alike have been eager to oversee jackal Australian imperialism’s part in the subjugation and exploitation of millions across Asia the Middle East and beyond. Today’s reactionary “border protection” regime is an integral part of Australia’s decades-long role as a bastion of white, capitalist privilege and junior partner to U.S. imperialism in Asia and the Pacific. Degrading and tormenting refugees serves a purpose—to whip up poisonous nationalism through which the bourgeois rulers strive to instil loyalty, if not submission, to the state and compact the population behind their racist and exploitative class rule. In opposition to the government’s racist immigration laws we demand all refugees be released. Close the detention camps! No deportations! Full citizenship rights for all who have made it here, including those on Manus Island and Nauru!

Bipartisan Racist Oppression

The Manus Island refugees’ heroic resistance sparked solidarity protests across the country and drew international attention to Australia's barbaric treatment of refugees. Under the current Australian government’s “Operation Sovereign Borders,” asylum seekers who come by boat are considered “illegal.” Denied the right to set foot in Australia, they are intercepted on the ocean by Australian naval forces and turned back towards Indonesia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Meanwhile, those captured on the high seas and transported to islands outside of Australian territory (for example under the previous Labor government’s “Pacific Solution Mark II”), remain imprisoned indefinitely in squalid camps on Manus Island and Nauru. Under threat of deportation back to the countries they fled—where they can face imprisonment and/or death—these refugees are stripped of any rights. Many have existed in these camps in a Guantánamo-style twilight zone for years.

The Australian government has spent $10 billion in the last three years alone persecuting these desperate people. Families have been ripped apart. Reports of sexual abuse and assaults on women and children are suppressed. Physical and psychological torture by guards and medical neglect are the norm. There are epidemic rates of depression, self-harm and attempted suicide. Six men have died at the MIDC. Last year a young Iranian refugee, Omid Masoumali, died in a Brisbane hospital after he set himself alight on Nauru.

Things are hardly better for those refugees incarcerated in the notoriously brutal compounds in Australia, such as Sydney’s Villawood Detention Centre. Nor for the tens of thousands on the temporary bridging visa E, judged to have been in Australia “unlawfully” and awaiting the outcome of refugee claims. Many cannot access healthcare or legally work. Living as an under-class on the fringes of society they are subject to a draconian and punitive “code of behaviour,” which exists over and above the legal system. One bridging visa holder has been incarcerated for more than two years for drinking a beer on a train. Meanwhile, the government recently stripped all welfare and housing support from asylum seekers who had been transferred to Australia for medical reasons. Labelled a “burden” on the welfare system, these people were also placed on bridging visa E for deportation.

The government's abuse of refugees follows the deeply racist traditions of Australian capitalism. From the bloody destruction of Aboriginal populations, to the exclusionary White Australia policy, to colonial domination in the Pacific, the Australian capitalist rulers have an unbroken record of brutal racist terror. The ALP is the historic party of White Australia par excellence. In 1992, mandatory detention was first implemented by the Keating Labor government. Since then, vying for the racist vote, successive Liberal/National Coalition and Labor governments have enforced ever more insular, repressive and blatantly racist immigration policies.

Imperialist Destruction in the Region

The Australian capitalist rulers’ use of their Nauru and PNG neocolonies as dumping grounds for refugees, in exchange for financial handouts to their cash-poor regimes, throws a sharp light on Australia’s sordid role in the region. At the beginning of the 20th century the tiny island of Nauru had massive deposits of phosphate, a valuable commodity used for fertiliser. Following World War I (WWI) Nauru fell under British rule and was jointly administered by New Zealand and Australia. The island’s phosphate was aggressively strip-mined and shipped mainly to Australia. When the reserves were exhausted Nauru was left as little more than a jagged moonscape unsuitable for any form of agriculture or even recreation. At the point of independence in 1968, the island was deemed uninhabitable. Eventually the economy collapsed. Today the population suffers extreme levels of diabetes and heart disease and Nauru is a dependent “client state” of Australia.

Australia’s role in PNG has been no less destructive. In 1884, Germany annexed the northern parts of New Guinea and Britain claimed the southern parts. Australia took over British New Guinea in 1906. Its army occupied German New Guinea during WWI and took control of all of New Guinea following the war. Thereafter Papuans were to suffer racist Australian “protection”: they were deprived of rights, subject to forced labour and forbidden to travel outside the country, especially to Australia. Following World War II, having “pacified” the country by punitive expeditions, massacres and the burning of villages, a thin layer of white planters, police, administrators and the feared Kiap (patrol officers) enforced a brutal regime of indentured servitude in the mines and copra plantations. BHP’s huge Ok Tedi gold and copper mine was run on apartheid lines.

Following PNG independence in 1975, Australian capitalism continued to dominate the country as a neocolonial overseer as large Australian mining companies, such as BHP, plundered the country’s resources while trashing the environment. To protect these fabulous profits and put down labour unrest and landowner protests, PNG police have been funded and trained by Australia. In 1989, the giant Australian-owned Panguna copper mine on the PNG island of Bougainville was shut down when independence fighters began waging a guerrilla war. In the ensuing seven-year conflict up to 20,000 Bougainvilleans died due to a crippling blockade and PNG police and military actions, all of which were directly brain-trusted, financed and armed by Canberra. PNG state forces continue to carry out brutal repression, such as the shooting last year of PNG students protesting government corruption. It is these same Australian-backed PNG state forces who have repeatedly assaulted refugees. Last April PNG defence personnel stormed the MIDC, firing bullets at buildings housing refugees.

Touching Faith in the Capitalist State

Aiming to silence criticism and stymie pro-refugee sentiment, in 2015 the government passed the Australian Border Force Act. Under this law, any staff member within the offshore detention system who speaks out about conditions in the camps is liable to two years in prison. The government has also attempted to enforce a media blackout. Despite the chilling impact of these measures, many continue to defy the Act. For example, in June 2016, psychologist Paul Stevenson stated that in 40 years working with the victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the conditions in Australia’s offshore camps were the worst “atrocity” he had seen.

By savagely punishing desperate asylum seekers the bourgeoisie aims to inure working people to the idea that loss of rights and horrific treatment, particularly for brown, dark-skinned and other non-European derived people, is the norm. At the same time they hone police-state measures, to be used against social struggles at home. Indeed, demonstrations across the country in solidarity with the Manus Island protesters have been increasingly met with a heavy police presence. Ominously a protest in Melbourne was attacked by fascists, and then by the cops, leaving at least one protester bloodied. The government’s relentless anti-refugee attacks and anti-Muslim “war on terror” have emboldened all manner of racist and fascist forces. Fascists pose a deadly danger to the workers movement and all the oppressed. They must be stopped by determined contingents of the organised working class, alongside all the fascists’ intended victims. This would be a step along the road to sweeping away the capitalist system that spawns this deadly menace.

It is a good thing that thousands have come out to solidarise with refugees. The main demands of the recent protests raised by various reformist groups such as Solidarity, Socialist Alternative (SAlt) and Socialist Alliance (SA) have been “Close the Camps” and ""Bring them here!"" Conspicuously absent have been demands for full citizenship rights for all who have made it here. This is no accident. Above all these reformists craft their demands to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the hope of attracting the church goers and small ‘l’ liberals who have come out in large numbers to protest. Unsurprisingly, the whole thrust of the demonstrations thus far have been to channel anger into futile appeals on the government and Labor “Opposition” to act on behalf of refugees while seeking to pressure the small bourgeois Greens party to the left. Most open in this regard is Solidarity who are key players within the Refugee Action Coalition (RAC).

Solidarity and other reformist groups have for years called for a vote to the Greens in federal elections. In every demonstration, Solidarity and the other reformists who inhabit RAC provide the Greens with a platform, and without criticism, to posture as bona fide defenders of refugees. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Greens uphold the capitalist system, including defending the borders of Australia. Their main concern about the mistreatment of refugees is that it may discredit Australian imperialism on the international stage, particularly in the Asia-Pacific. Lest there be any doubt, it was the Greens who propped up the Gillard-Rudd minority Labor government of 2010-13, even after it introduced its draconian offshore processing regime and re-opened the Nauru and Manus Island centres.

Promoting the illusion of a kinder, fairer capitalist state, in 2009 SAlt, SA and the Socialist Party (SP) signed a statement that called for refugees to be allowed to “live in freedom in Australia while their claims are processed.” The wretched SP continue to raise a qualitatively similar demand today. Thus on bended knees these reformists accept that the racist capitalist state should have the power to decide who, among those already living here, is not to be “accepted.”

Such touching faith in the capitalist state was sharply revealed two years ago when these same left groups came out in support of strikes by the Australian Border Force (ABF). Along with the police, military, and prisons, immigration officers form part of the armed fist of the state, which exists to suppress the working class and anyone who challenges the bourgeoisie's rule. The ABF enforces the bosses’ racist immigration laws, including by patrolling air and seaports and carrying out deportations and onshore detention. Support to ABF strikes is consistent with the reformist view that the capitalist state can be made to serve the interests of the workers and oppressed. However, Marxists know that any hard-fought defence of workers’ rights, and the rights of the oppressed, will face the repressive apparatus of the capitalist state.

Successful “strikes” for better conditions for border force, screws and cops simply mean they are better armed to repress the struggles of workers and minorities. In embracing customs and immigration officers as union brothers the reformist left are tailing and covering for the pro-capitalist union tops who organise these and other state forces into the unions. In contrast we seek to bring to the working class the understanding that it must organise independently of the bourgeoisie and its state. In sharp political opposition to the current misleaders and their left tails, class-struggle militants in the unions would seek to mobilise the proletariat to oust the cops, screws, immigration officers and security guards from the unions.

We Need a Multiracial Revolutionary Workers Party

Capitalists around the world, including Australia, are slashing jobs and carrying out anti-union attacks. Anti-immigrant racism divides the working class in the face of capitalist attacks and must be fought by the organised workers movement. Workers must be won to the understanding that they share a common class interest with the workers of all countries and all nationalities against the capitalist class enemy. Mobilising the workers movement in defence of refugees and immigrant rights is crucial to defending the multiracial working class, which needs unity in struggle to fight the bosses.

The main obstacle to such a program is the ALP-loyal, sell-out trade-union leadership, who propagate the nationalist lie that there can be a unity of interests between workers and the capitalist rulers who get rich by exploiting workers’ labour power. While unions such as the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) have joined protests in defence of refugees and previously stated their opposition to mandatory detention, offshore processing and deportations, the leadership pushes vile protectionism, demanding ""Aussie resources, local jobs,"" and helps promote anti-immigrant hysteria by giving support to the government's ""border protection"" measures.

In opposition to nationalist Laborism we seek to build a multiracial revolutionary workers party like the Bolshevik Party led by V.I. Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Such a party would act as a tribune of the people, taking up the struggle against every manifestation of capitalist oppression. In contrast to the reformist left, we Marxists do not seek to advise capitalist governments on more “progressive” immigration policies. All immigration laws in defence of the nationally-based bourgeoisie’s rule are necessarily racist and chauvinist. Our perspective as Marxists is to build a party that can mobilise the multiracial working class in struggle against all of the government's racist immigration laws. The fight for full citizenship rights for all who have made it here is part of the struggle to sweep away the brutal rule of capitalism. It will take a series of socialist revolutions around the world to open the road to the construction of classless, egalitarian societies based on material abundance where all will be able to live free from oppression. For a workers republic of Australia, part of a socialist Asia!

Independence for Catalonia! Down With the EU!

Spain Strangles Catalonia

For Workers Republics!

OCTOBER 30—Three days ago, the parliament of Catalonia voted to secede from Spain and establish an independent Catalan republic. Minutes later, the Spanish senate, dominated by the Castilian chauvinists of the right-wing Popular Party (PP) and of the social-democratic Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), voted to dissolve the Catalan parliament and depose the regional government.

Madrid is officially seizing control of Catalonia, including its finances, police force and major TV and radio stations under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which enables the rulers of the Spanish prison house of oppressed peoples to strip autonomous communities of their powers. It has also ordered new regional elections on December 21. Catalan pro-independence deputies, including President Carles Puigdemont (of the Partit Demòcrata Europeu Català, PDeCAT) and his vice president Oriol Junqueras (of the Esquerra Republicana, ERC) have been threatened with arrest for “rebellion,” for which they could spend as long as 30 years in prison. Two prominent leaders of independentiste groups, Jordi Sànchez of the Catalan National Assembly and Jordi Cuixart of Òmnium Cultural, were imprisoned on October 16 and face trial for sedition.

The Spanish state unleashed a wave of repression in late September in an attempt to suppress the October 1 Catalan independence referendum. Over two million people cast ballots, courageously defying the thousands of vicious Guardia Civil and Policía Nacional sent by Madrid. Ninety percent voted in favor of independence. Since then, Catalonia and its largest city, Barcelona, have been rocked by huge protests demanding an end to the repression and freedom for the imprisoned independence leaders. Several chauvinist protests have also taken place, led by the neo-Francoist PP, the right-wing Ciutadans and the social-democratic Partit dels Socialistes de Catalunya (PSC), in defense of the unity of monarchical, Castile-ruled capitalist Spain. It is in the interests of the working class throughout Spain and France to defend the oppressed Catalan people, whose nation straddles the Franco-Spanish border. Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil out of Catalonia! Free Cuixart, Sànchez and all pro-independence activists! Down with the monarchy! Defend Catalan independence!

Like Catalonia, the oppressed Basque nation in Euskal Herria (the Basque Country) stretches from Spain into France. For decades, the Basques have suffered deadly repression at the hands of both the Spanish and French governments. As proletarian revolutionary internationalists, we fight for the independence of the Basque Country and Catalonia, North and South—that is, against the capitalist rulers of both France and Spain. We seek to build Leninist-Trotskyist parties that support the just struggles of oppressed nations, which can be a lever to advance the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat against the capitalist rulers. Our program is for proletarian revolution, the seizure of power by the working class. For workers republics in Catalonia and the Basque Country as parts of a voluntary Socialist United States of Europe!

For the Catalan workers and poor, the struggle for national liberation is a component part of their struggle against exploitation. The potential power of the working class was demonstrated in a small but important way by the port workers in Barcelona and Tarragona, who refused to service the ships being used to house the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil at the time of the referendum. But Catalan workers have not been mobilized as an independent force due to their wretched reformist misleaders, who, on the whole, refuse to fight for Catalan independence. For this reason, Catalan workers are dissolved into the mass movement, and pro-independence working-class militants have nowhere to look for their liberation except to the bourgeois nationalists. It is necessary to forge a revolutionary proletarian leadership that champions the struggle for national liberation.

No Illusions in the Catalan Bourgeoisie!

Amid fears that an independent Catalonia would be kicked out of the European Union (EU), a host of Catalan companies, including two large banks, CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell, promptly seized on Madrid’s offerings and opted to register their headquarters outside Catalonia. The Catalan bourgeoisie (represented prominently by the PDeCAT and its predecessors, as well as by the ERC) has sometimes used separatism as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Madrid. But the chauvinist, vindictive humiliations inflicted by the central government, as well as pressure from the Catalan masses, have pushed the political representatives of a section of the Catalan bourgeoisie into open defiance. Puigdemont postponed declaring independence after the October 1 referendum, and even offered to hold early regional elections if PP prime minister Mariano Rajoy would guarantee that Catalonia would retain its autonomous status. But the Castilian-chauvinist Rajoy and his cohorts would have nothing less than total capitulation. Thus, the Catalan government declared independence.

Madrid has made clear that it will go to any lengths to maintain the territorial integrity of Spain, while Catalonia lacks anything resembling a state of its own—centrally, armed forces—that could resist the Spanish state. The Catalan working class, meanwhile, has given no sign of significant independent motion. Under these circumstances, there is no hope of realizing Catalan independence now. Yet Catalonia remains in turmoil. With the immediate prospect of further repression and humiliation at the hands of the Castilian overlords, combined with the impotence of the Catalan bourgeoisie, further struggles are likely to erupt—the Catalan masses are in dire need of allies.

Such allies are to be found primarily in the proletariat of Spain and France. The Spanish and French bourgeoisies are both oppressing the Catalans and Basques and exploiting the working class as a whole. The breakup of the reactionary Spanish state would open the road for workers struggle against the capitalist rulers in Madrid. A relentless struggle must be waged against the chauvinism promoted by social democrats and the labor lieutenants of capital in the trade-union bureaucracies in order to win workers in the region to the fight for self-determination of the oppressed nations.

The struggle of the Catalan people has resonated across the border with Basques and Catalans living in France. Protests in support of Catalan independence have taken place in both the north and south of Euskal Herria. In an act of solidarity by Catalans in France, the ballots for the October 1 referendum were printed in Catalunya Nord and transported across the border.

Despite the Catalan government’s constant appeals, the rulers of the reactionary, imperialist EU have backed Madrid’s repression to the hilt, precisely because they know that a breakup of Spain portends a breakup of the EU. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned that “we need to avoid splits, because we already have enough splits and fractures,” and that the EU could not be made up of “95 different states.” The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, made it clear on October 22 that “no one is going to recognise Catalonia in Europe as an independent country.” The EU is an instrument for the imperialist powers of Europe, centrally Germany, to ratchet up the exploitation of the working people throughout Europe and to further impoverish weaker countries such as Greece and Portugal.

For Proletarian Political Independence!

The Rajoy government’s repression, supported by its lapdogs in the PSOE, has evoked memories of the dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco and its savage suppression of Basque, Catalan and Galician national rights. PP spokesman Pablo Casado didn’t hesitate to invoke this bloody history when he warned Puigdemont not to declare independence “because perhaps the person who makes the declaration will end up like the person who made the declaration 83 years ago.” This is a reference to Lluís Companys, the bourgeois-nationalist president of the Catalan Generalitat who was executed by a Francoist firing squad after the defeat of the Spanish Revolution. (See “Trotskyism vs. Popular Frontism in the Spanish Civil War,” Spartacist [English-language edition] No. 61, Spring 2009.)

The reality is that the repression being meted out today is fully in keeping with the legal framework of Spanish bourgeois democracy. The oppression of the Basque, Catalan and Galician nations was enshrined in the 1978 post-Franco constitution, which maintains that Spain cannot be divided. The two historic parties of the Spanish working class, the PSOE and the Communist Party (PCE), supported the formation of a monarchical state based on the denial of the right to self-determination of the oppressed nations of Spain and voted for the 1978 constitution.

The PSOE in government loyally served the king and fomented Castilian chauvinism for decades, notoriously setting up death squads to murder Basque independence fighters in the 1980s. For its own part, the PCE has also maintained its disgusting opposition to independence for the oppressed. The chauvinist misleaders of the CCOO and UGT union federations bear responsibility for the fact that workers in Catalonia and Spain have not come out as an organized force in defense of independence for Catalonia and the Basque Country.

The PSOE’s Catalan counterpart, the PSC, joined with Francoists and fascists in a reactionary demonstration in Barcelona on October 8 and October 29, under slogans such as “Catalonia is Spain.” Emboldened by Rajoy’s offensive, on October 27 fascists attacked the headquarters of Catalunya Ràdio as well as a Catalan cultural center and school in Barcelona. The fascists are a deadly danger to all workers, immigrants and oppressed minorities, and the working class must be mobilized to stop them.

With the PSOE heavily discredited among working people for having mercilessly administered EU-dictated austerity, the bourgeois Podemos party—which issued out of the 2011 petty-bourgeois Indignados movement—has taken up the task of refurbishing Spanish bourgeois democracy. Podemos has mobilized protests in opposition to Rajoy’s repression against Catalonia. But Podemos is firmly opposed to Catalan independence and merely provides brutal Castilian chauvinism with a “human face”: an October 23 letter to its membership decried any declaration of Catalan independence as “illegitimate.” Podemos advises the Spanish bourgeoisie to “ensure that Catalonia remains a part of Spain” with the carrot of greater democracy, rather than the stick of repression. Podemos has moved to strip the leadership of its Catalan organization (Podem) of its authority for not being hard enough against independence.

A more left-appearing Catalan bourgeois-nationalist party is the Candidatura d’Unitat Popular (CUP). Although the CUP claims to be socialist, in fact it is a party based on the petty bourgeoisie. It propped up the regional capitalist government for more than a year. The affiliate of the British Socialist Workers Party in Catalonia, En Lluita, liquidated completely into the CUP last year. These opportunists had no trouble simultaneously building the pro-independence CUP in Catalonia, while building the anti-independence Podemos in other parts of Spain, i.e., capitulating to one bourgeois nationalism or another.

No such confusion afflicts the fake-Trotskyist Internationalist Group (IG), which capitulates entirely to Castilian chauvinism. In their article “Defend the Right to Self-Determination and Independence for Catalonia” (September 2017) they do anything but defend Catalan independence. The IG denigrates the Catalan people’s just struggle for national liberation, sneering: “This is a nationalist movement led by the richest bourgeoisie in Spain” and “The impulse for independence comes above all from powerful sectors of the well-to-do Catalan bourgeoisie.” You’d think the IG had taken a page from the Francoist newspaper ABC, which wrote that the “Catalanist revolt against the state is a performance of the rich, by the rich and for the rich” (4 June).

These petty-bourgeois professors in the U.S. urged Catalans to battle their way to the polling stations on October 1—defying police truncheons, rubber bullets and tear gas—to “cast a blank ballot”! Dripping with contempt for the oppressed Catalans, the IG rants: “It’s not like some national liberation movement in a semi-colonial country.” The IG’s counterposition between national liberation struggles in the backward and advanced countries reveals their fundamentally Third World nationalist perspective. Further, the IG argues that Catalonia’s separation from Spain “could seriously undercut the potential for united struggle of the working class throughout the peninsula” (“Mass Resistance to Police Repression in Catalonia,” 4 October).

It is Madrid’s national oppression of Catalans, Basques and Galicians that has undercut the unity of the working classes in the artificial Spanish state. This unity can only be achieved by boldly championing the liberation of the oppressed nations—the opposite of the IG’s left-talking chauvinism, which blames the oppressed Catalans for dividing the working class, rather than the Castilian bourgeoisie and its reformist lackeys.

Bolshevik leader V.I. Lenin emphasized that achieving proletarian unity requires breaking the chains binding an oppressed nation to its oppressor. He used as an example Norway, which gained independence from Sweden following a 1905 referendum:

“The close alliance between the Norwegian and Swedish workers, their complete fraternal class solidarity, gained from the Swedish workers’ recognition of the right of the Norwegians to secede. This convinced the Norwegian workers that the Swedish workers were not infected with Swedish nationalism, and that they placed fraternity with the Norwegian proletarians above the privileges of the Swedish bourgeoisie and aristocracy. The dissolution of the ties imposed upon Norway by the monarchs of Europe and the Swedish aristocracy strengthened the ties between the Norwegian and Swedish workers.”

—“The Right of Nations to Self-Determination” (1914)

As explained in the current issue of our international theoretical journal, Spartacist (No. 65, Summer 2017), Lenin’s steadfast defense of the right of self-determination and implacable opposition to Great Russian chauvinism were crucial in forging the Bolshevik Party. It was Lenin’s revolutionary internationalist program that allowed the Bolsheviks to lead the working class to power 100 years ago. Today, the ICL upholds Leninism on the national question as part of our struggle for new October Revolutions.

Hello,

My  politics derive from a fundamental anti-authoritarianism and pro  personal liberty/freedom perspective. However, liberty without equality  is impossible. Equality is a pre-requsite (this is however I differ from  right-libertarians which is what most americans think when they heard  the word).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-libertarianism#Economics)

I  am a big support of worker owned firms and would like to see an economy  that consists of many well-established firms that are worker owned and  new startups that initially give extra to the entrepreneur that started  them (I have outlined this in other posts and my rationale, it is to solve an incentive issue with coops in the current market), but  eventually treats them like any other worker. Class distinctions would  shrink and we would have a society of upper-middle class to lower  wealthy, in short everyone would be relatively well off, and no worker  exploitation could occur. As firms are worker owned, automation needn't  be a job killer and we can enjoy the benefits of robots reducing our  work time and increasing efficiency and profits for everyone.

I  am also a georgist, I don't think land ownership really makes sense,  and is fundamentally illegitimate. Big support of a LVT which can be  used to fund things like Universal Health care (though I generally  prefer a public option over MFA), public housing, etc.

So  given all of that, would I fit in here? The green party speaks to many  concerns, particularly about the environment, which is good, but idk if I  belong here. I was orginally thinking about joining the libertarian  socialist caucus in the Libertarian party, but I feel like that party is  too dominated by right-libertarians for my liking (especially after their recent tweet about racism...)

Thoughts?

*Radio Freedom* is a compilation album, featuring twenty political/protest songs in all styles of music: metal, folk, hip hop, and more.

The long-term aim of the project is to establish a worker-owned, for-profit record label.

Politically-aware  musicians often have two choices: make money for a  company that goes  against everything they believe in, or go 'DIY' and  live in poverty.

Musicians shouldn't have to choose between making a difference and making a living.

The musicians on *Radio Freedom* will get a percentage which is well over the industry norm.

The funding goal represents the cost of mastering the songs, pressing the CDs, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.

The CDs will be manufactured by Austep Music, an environmentally-friendly music printing company.

"How has communism seemingly overtaken the American internet, while Democratic Socialism and even Social Democracy is left unheard?",Liberal,91,sks1xi,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sks1xi/how_has_communism_seemingly_overtaken_the/,49,"I know many of you here might not subscribe to Democratic Socialism ideas because it would stray away from basically all of capitalism. I personally enjoy certain aspects that capitalism has brought, but I still see the evils of such a system, and fully in support of Social Democracy as a transition into whatever the fuck is better than what we have now.

But far too many times have I tried to state my bias against capitalism only to be called a Mao loving dictator cocksucker. When the ideals of socialism have changed from a transition into communism, and more so a cooperative workplace that places workers rights and unity at the forefront, without hoping a dictator would distribute wealth evenly? (At least a certain subset of Socialism, e.g Socdem)

Current and past Communist regimes are as far away from its ideals as it could be, and the only way to even achieve a Communist state would be through gradual socialism and the equalization of all humans, but Capitalism and the choice to do whatever you want is itself a good thing, just that oppression and inequality is the bane of its existence, and it will NOT be fixed unless Democratic Socialism or even Social Democracy is achieved in place of Capitalism, not as a replacement, but as an evolution.

So if real ""communists"" who probably haven't ever read its basic principles, are against the oppressive capitalist USA regime, why the hell do they trust that a dictator and one party state is not consolidating power and wealth just like the Central banks of capitalism? Sure maybe if Buddha himself came back and lead the world into communism it might work, but absolute power corrupts absolutely no matter what the intentions to start off with?

Why has the only real alternative to fixing this horrifically oppressive inequal system of Capitalism, drowned out by dictator Communists, and then in doing so, having us grouped with ""Big government"" when in reality that's the exact thing we are trying to resolve? It baffles me to think that a lot of intense right wing republicans have been so indoctrinated to the American ""freedom"" that they think having tax cuts for the rich enhances their own freedoms as an American, without realizing just how much they are being oppressed. Living in propaganda without a view of the outside world is exactly how North Korea is able to never get a revolution. Americans think they're smart, but they're just as brainwashed as North Koreans when it comes to their own personal oppressions. It baffles me how few Americans really embrace other cultures to see how much better life would be without lobbyists and big corporations.

Is there still hope for a Social Democracy in America? Bernie sanders was as some may believe, cheated out of running against Biden. With a two party system in place, how will we achieve true democracy, and finally equalize the wealth distribution?

I'm still learning about the various different socialistic principles and the spectrum of the left, its horribly disjointed and a probable cause as to why nobody knows what the fuck Socialism is. But I just feel absolutely hopeless, everywhere I look, I can see my self being oppressed. Every item I buy, every transaction I make, person I meet, somehow it all leads back to the rich benefiting from it more than me. Every game I buy, I just know there's some wagecuck dev getting whipped everyday by their CEOs to meet deadlines, every indie game I support I just know some corporation is taking 30% cut of their product just to release it. Every business I buy from is getting fucked over by the big advertising agencies that oppress everyone and force them to use their platform or die without.

The exploitation is ingrained, and I don't know if we can ever equalize it, maybe I'm completely wrong about socialistic ideals, and maybe this entire rant didn't even make sense, but I just want to know if at least we'll ever escape this exploitation?

Edit: Also, how the hell can Bernie call himself and his ideas Democratic Socialism, when he appeals to millennials who enjoy the benefits (be it very slight) of capitalism? You look up Dem Soc and you see people wanting to abolish capitalism for absolute socialism through democracy, which is absolutely impossible because of how ingrained we are into Capitalistic ideals. I can't even personally imagine a world without it, let alone kids in a world without a new iPhone every year. Social Democracy is achievable, Democratic Socialism is not, unless a revolution happens, then it would just be Socialism and not Democratic.

This express exclusion overrides any contrary language within this document.**
   * **In the event that the express exclusion of the preceding paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then all activities including the ownership of property and the right to sue, but not including the ability to be sued, are expressly excluded from the purpose of this legal person. In the event that the exclusion of this paragraph is activated, no person shall be shielded from liability by this legal person.**   **This paragraph overrides any contrary language within  this document other than the preceding paragraph.”**
* (b) All persons applying for the creation of any such legal person are officially on notice of these provisions as of the date this section comes into effect, and any charter, articles or incorporation or other creating documents issued after that date which do not contain the above language shall be treated for all legal and equitable purposes as if they did contain this language. Any authority who fails to include this language in such creating documents is subject to mandamus in federal court, but this subsection shall not be interpreted as limiting the right of mandamus in any non-federal court.
* (c) In the event that subsections (a) and/or (b) of this section are judicially found to be facially unenforceable, then all U.S. States, and all authorities delegated by the U.S. or any state, territory or tribe of the U.S. with the authority under law to create legal persons are hereby prohibited from creating any such legal persons from the date such judicial findings become mandatory precedent to such state(s), territory(ies), tribe(s)  and/or delegated authority(ies).

* (d) All existing laws whether state, federal, territorial or tribal which conflict with subsections (a), (b) or (c) are hereby repealed to the extent that they so contradict those subsections.

**Why does it work?**

Since the Civil War, the United States has moved from a position in which corporations required specific purpose statements in their charters to allowing no specific purpose. This means that you can make corporations that do anything. Before general purpose corporations, corporations that did things that were not listed on their purpose statements could be hauled into court under a doctrine called *ultra vires*. Essentially, it was an argument that they had gone beyond the limitations of the legal privilege of incorporation the government had given them. Now that very few people use anything other than general purpose corporations, the doctrine of *ultra vires* has all but died out for corporations.

But if this language were written into the charter of a corporation, and it then tried to influence an electoral process, the doctrine of *ultra vires* would again apply, allowing the government, or in some cases, shareholders, to sue the company for injunctive relief to prevent it from undertaking the *ultra vires* action of attempting to influence elections.

**What about Freedom of Speech?**

The resulting lawsuits based on *ultra vires* would not be founded on any federal law which restricted speech. Rather, the lawsuit would operate based on the charter itself.  No one would deny that it is the right of the government to control the terms on which it issues charters, and no one would deny it is the power of a charter to control the actions of a corporation. Effectively, this law is simply the government saying that it chooses not to grant the right of limited liability to anyone who would use it for this purpose.

There is a small chance that the express exclusion in question might be held unenforceable since it is, arguably, a content-based discrimination of speech, although I would argue the government-as-speaker exception applies, but if that happens, the second paragraph (the nuclear suicide exclusion) introduces a new exclusion which is not a content-based discrimination and which effectively paralyzes the corporation from doing anything at all. There is no doubt that this second section is constitutional, and messing with it would be like disarming a very touchy landmine for any corporate lawyer. And just in case they disarm it too well, it tanks the entire corporate reproductive system altogether. My guess is nobody even tries to disarm it, and if they do, no judge would be stupid enough to actually do it.

**What about a constitutional amendment?**

How’s that been going lately?

**What about staffing the courts with more liberal justices?**

If somebody is willing to pack the court, I’m all for it, but nobody seems down, so I thought I’d suggest we try this instead. Even if you were to pull it off, it’s hard to know in advance they would actually overturn *Citizens United*. The right case would have to come along, and they really couldn’t promise to do so before or be held to any promises to do so later. It becomes a game of personality politics. Iffy.

**Why does it have to be federal?**

Because it has to preempt state law, or states will just keep racing to the bottom to help investors circumvent it. Unless you can get all states to pass it at the same time, it won't work, and you can't get that done. But federal is one and done.

**Won’t the same lobbyists who have been running the show so far stop its passage?**

Maybe, but what’s nice about it is that it does not apply to the clients of any of those lobbyists. Those lobbyists all represent existing corporations, not new ones. Existing corporations can be told that they’re about to get an extremely valuable permanent market advantage if they just stay out of the way. A little coalition building could probably get funds raised from some companies who wish to get this advantage against those who wish to stop it. It should be just divisive enough to split the ruling class between the rope sellers and everybody else.

**Well, if we’re going to be this radical, why do we have to stop with the creation of new corporations? Can’t we go after the existing ones too?**

The trouble there is that the corporations that already exist are going to be harder to tackle with a statute. They’re already dug in and have been found to have constitutional rights which will beat any statute we throw at them. We’ll have to take their constitutional rights the same way we take everybody else’s away: make up stupid laws and convict them of crimes. Or we could just tax them until they go broke, but that’s all for after we’ve got enough control over our own lawmaking processes that we can actually get the job done.

The ability of these corporations to reproduce is critical to the way that they control the government. If that’s stopped, then any existing corporation playing the Super-PAC game can be exposed and the harm it can do can be limited. Think about how anything with ties to the Koch Brothers can't function once the ties are exposed. If their reproduction can be stopped, so can their rebranding, and so can their concealment. From there, we can get enough control to finish them off. We can always have government lawyers hunt them down later, find some evidence of crime and revoke their charters. Once we get control of the political process, putting the government’s best and brightest lawyers and accountants on the job of nailing multi-billion-dollar corporations to the wall should be reasonably doable. One step at a time. First, we cut their balls off. Then we worry about what’s left of them.

**This seems like the kind of tactic a Republican would use.**

It does to me too, but they fight like they want to win, not like they want to look good losing.

**Why has nobody suggested this before?**

Beats me. It's my original idea. Feel free to spread it around. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. If you have a suggestion to make it a better, or a reason it won’t work, let’s hear it.",1640864036.0

That was the motto of Johannes Rau.  Rau was the eight President of Germany form 1999-2004, the sixth primer of Northrhine-Westphalia for 20 years form 1978-1998. He also was a social democrat and protestant Christan, earing him the nickname ""Bruder Johannes"" (Brother Johannes). Rau was well known for being a good listener and for being in touch with the people. 

And I think there is a lot we can learn from him. Especially, to reconcile and unite instead of dividing.  
Yesterday I talked a bit with a friend and she expressed on the one hand the she thought that the economy was, direct quote ""Quite fucked"" but also that she felt like we are growing more divided, that nobody would listen to her or her interests who has power (aka. politicans) . And I also agree, I have the feeling, that the social climate has become rougher, we do not listen to each other and do not admit when we are in the wrong. We have become less human if you want so. And sure it is easy to just point the finger at neoliberalism and say ""muuuuu they made everything worse buuuhhh"" and while there may be some (or a lot) of truth to that, it does not help anyone, in the contrary, it further divides us. And that can not be the goal. We must work towards a peaceful and more united society.   
We should listen more to each other, to those how are weak and hold little power, to the middle class, to our political opponents and yes even to the rich neoliberals. Listening with respect to the other is an integral part of democracy and one that I feel like we should commit more to. For a better and less divided future. I also think that we do not have to listen to fashos, or other people that want to overthrow democracy. But to anyone who believes in democracy. We should do that in order to lessen the divide we have, to make people feel like their voices are being heard and a better (social) climate in general.",1644767419.0

In a libertarian point of view, sanctions are against some kind of freedom.

Do you feel the US should defend ukraine?,Liberal,29,sdpde2,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sdpde2/do_you_feel_the_us_should_defend_ukraine/,58,"I was recently having a discussion with my right libertarian dad and he basically saw no benefit in defending Ukraine ""I see no strategic reason to defend Ukraine. Sell them lots of guns for sure. But defend them? What possible reason do we have to do that? Who cares if one deeply corrupt government replaces another?""

My response was basically this:
Appeasement doesn't work. It won't stop at Ukraine. Soon it will be the Baltic, maybe Finland or some region the US is not willing to back down on

By not defending Ukraine we are giving Russia a great deal more power and confidence. And giving them control far closer to our ally and one of our biggest trade partners, the EU. It is very difficult to see how an EU russia conflict or a Europe dominated by Russia is a good thing for American interests.

It also plays further into the decline of democracy seen worldwide. Not to say that Ukraine is a perfect democracy or anything (it is pretty corrupt), but it does mean that the russians would be closer to the stronger democracies in Western Europe. Which is cause for concern.

So in short, by not defending Ukraine we are making a hostile power stronger, further threatening global democracy, threatening Europe, and potentially destabilizing the whole region.

What do you think?

Idk if I am convinced by my own arguments, but it is clear that appeasement doesn't work. Like I know what he would say:
""Why should we care if it stops with Ukraine? Who cares if Poland or Finland fell to Russia? Why is it America's problem. Why should we care about Europe at all?""

Fundamentally, I think that it is wrong for a larger country to invade a smaller sovereign nation to ""reclaim"" lost territory of some long lost empire. It.is wrong to bully smaller countries and overthrow their governments. That applies to the US too mind you, we have done some horrid shit.

But in this case, it is pretty clear who is the aggressor.

I believe that it is morally correct to support Ukraine, but morality is rarely a geopolitical guiding principle. If Ukraine fell, Russia wouldn't stop there. But purely geopolitically speaking, why should the US care? Should it? If Europe were dominated by Russia should that even worry us? Why/why not?

Over the past week Justin Trudeau and his liberal cabinent have evoked Emergency powers so as to crush the peaceful Freedom Convoy demonstrators and confiscate their bank accounts without any  court orders.

These are demonstrators who after agreeing to Leave their ambassador bridge protest hugged the Police officers who saw them off and had broken up the remainder of the border protests without incident before the emergencies act even took effect, and even after this weekend which saw Officers trample a elderly disabled indigenous woman under horse, and after police had beaten protestors, and seemingly purposefully fired teargas canisters into the legs of attending reporters,  The protestors still joined in chants of “We love you” directed at the cops in an attempt to deescalate and appeal to their better nature. 

An attempt met repeatedly with flash-bangs and rubber bullets.

 .

Many Canadians and Americans have wondered what they can do to resist the seeming death of protest rights in Canada. What can you do when the banks themselves are confiscating perfectly legal donations to peaceful protests and legal defence funds? What can you do when voicing your opinion or merely having made a legal donation can be declared retroactively illegal and you can have your bank account frozen as a result, without even a court order?

The Magnitsky Act was designed to allow the US government more options in dealing with human rights abuses and the silencing of opposition by abusive regimes, by allowing the US government to sanction individual government figures and politically connected individuals directly. Freezing their bank accounts, locking them out of international finance, barring their entry to the US and preventing US firms from doing business with them.

The Magnitsky act was criticized at the time: Why these human rights abuses? Why target Russia? Saudi Arabia keeps 51% percent of its population in a state of apartheid, unable to work, leave the country, or even show their face with out a husband’s permission... why focus on a country which has been considered for admission to NATO, and as recently as the early 2000s the US recognized as democratic?

There are of course plenty of cynical interpretations... but being charitable: the Magnitsky Act is not for the worst human rights abusers. Hardened dictatorships easily weather such sanctions and are well prepared with shell companies, hidden accounts, and other vehicles to evade such limited sanctions. The Magnitsky act was not passed in response to North Korea or the Chinese genocide of the Uighers. It was brought in for the comparatively minor abuse of Russian oligarchs murdering those investigating their corruption (allegedly), not because Russia was some totalitarian country in 2012, but because Russia was still arguably a democracy.

The Magnitsky act is not made for the worst human rights abusers, it is made for democracies that are sliding. The status of Democracy is not an award where you win it , and then like so many Oscar winning actors, you get to coast and make bad comedies for  decades on end. Democracy is a standard of liberty and open debate that a country has to maintain every single day. The US was right to recognize that when someone is commiting criminal acts or abusing political connections to deprive people of their democratic rights, the democracies of the world should call that individual out and use what economic power they have to stop it.

.

Currently both the Government of Alberta and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association are suing Trudeau’s government, arguing that even the lax language of The Emergencies Act does not apply to the Freedom convoy protests. That the act explicitly forbids the declaration of an emergency for peaceful protests, and that the requirements that such an emergency threaten the lives and safety of Canadians, or the sovereignty of Canada was at no time met... the protests being peaceful, the only threat to life coming from police, and The protestors willing breaking up encampments in response to court orders.

Maybe to staid Canadian courts will act but observers can conclude what is obvious: this was an illegal power grab by Trudeau meant to retroactively declare legal donations and legal peaceful protests illegal, and to punish both Canadians,  and Americans with canadian bank-accounts, by seizing their money without a court order, using information illegally hacked from an American company and distributed by state run media at the CBC, so as to punish dissidents for mere political disagreement. shutting them out of the financial system, unable to buy food or pay rent, in the depths of the Canadian winter.

And not a single Executive or Board member from a Canadian big 5 bank has spoken out about this or raised a legal challenge to this illegal violation of their customer’s liberty and property, which they themselves, the banks, are being asked to enforce. The positions of banker is a sacred trusts. Millions have trusted these people with their money on the basis of their presumed character and their strong institutional ethics, a banker should be happily willing to go to jail for years rather than betray his customers to an illegal order, and when he is being asked to do this without even a court order, we’d expect him to be screaming from the rooftops. Canadian bankers instead are gladly accepting the horrifying power Trudeau has given them, and see no problem with betraying decades long customers for the crime of donating to a charity or legal defence fund.

For this reason I believe the US government should Sanction the  executives and board members of the big 5 Canadian banks:  TD (Toronto Dominion), CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce), Scotiabank, RBC (Royal Bank of Canada), and BMO (Bank of Montreal).

Similarly Trudeau and His cabinet should be sanctioned. Just as they have frozen Canadians assets for peaceful protests, the US should use the Magnitsky act to Freeze their assets for their abuses and bar them from US travel just as they had barred truckers from returning to their own country. Sparing of course back bencher Liberal MPs such as Joel Lighbound who have been horrified and vocal in opposition to their own party’s abuses,  even before the emergencies act was declared.

Ironically  deputy prime minister Crystia Freeland, was instrumental in the initial passing of the Magnitsky act, even having pages of hagiographic praise in Bill Browder's book about its passing, and Canada passed its own Magnitsky in 2015 on her influence. We can speculate whether she was a hypocrite then or now, but these are the standards she, and the government of Canada, agreed to be held to. There is no philosophical debate about whether its right or wrong for the US to interfere in Canada’s affairs, These are the same people who vehemently cheered on the US sanctioning Russians in 2012.

Like Tin pot dictators the world over, Trudeau and his cabinet have denounced the “American influence” behind the freedom convoy, denouncing Americans donating to legal defence funds and peaceful protests for Canadians civil liberties. A preferred attack being to accuse the protestors of being Trump supporters, Ie. to accuse them of of being sympathetic to the previous democratically elected president of Canada’s closest ally. With Justice minister David Lametti saying that Trump supporters “should be worried” about having their bank accounts frozen by the Canadian Government.

All this from a government that has nothing but praise for the World Economic Forum or OECD sending millions around the world to fund advocacy institutes in places as far a field as Hungary or Ukraine.

The free spread of ideas and donations for non-partisan, non-election related,  advocacy and support across international borders is the backbone of any free and open society, whether it be Amnesty international or the Jesuits, philosophical and political advocacy of all kinds has been international since the 18th century. Crystia Freeland herself was a Canadian doing journalism and political advocacy for a US media company in Ukraine and spent decades in US politics, Trudeau himself consistently criticized President Trump and used Canadian tax dollars to fund media that was equally critical and presumably had some influence on US politics.

But now that ordinary Americans are expressing equal interest in Canadian politics Trudeau and perhaps the most internationally affiliated cabinet of any country in the world, that have spent collective centuries outside Canada and advocating politics in other countries, they want to retreat into nationalist chauvinism and issolationism... No.

Trudeau wants to freeze bank accounts for donating to a cause he merely accuses of supporting the previous elected  American president, without a court order, he wants to freeze bank accounts quite possibly held by American Citizens or dual nationals, at Banks such as TD or Scotiabank, banks many ordinary Americans use, as his justice minister confirms that “Trump Supporters”  quote “Should be worried”.

Trudeau doesn’t get to pretend this is something where Americans should mind their own business, this concerns Americans greatly.

Biden is has been prominently siding with Trudeau in this, but Americans should be calling on their Republican Governors, Senators,  and congressmen, people like Ron Desantis, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and others who have been deeply critical of Trudeau to Openly demand the use of the Magnitsky Act.

In many respects its already happening to Americans, many of their donations are frozen, a Delaware based company has already been hacked and its donors leaked over this, and all to crush an international protest already planning convoys to Washington.

# Social Democracy and Economic Policy

Many Social Democrats find a strong passion in redistribution, and pushing for egalitarian policies that would support people of all backgrounds. What few may realize is that these very policies may be beneficial for economic performance.


A book published by ILO and post-Keynesian economists titled *Wage-Led Growth* (you can find a PDF of it and notes in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FdPrxS2WNueDLMc0B8A-fNpO3NpFCzwt)) goes over, in more detail, what my blog posts have to offer. Not only does the book expand on what I have to offer in my blog posts, but it also touches basis on recent trends resulting from conservative policy-making (such as rising inequality) and the consequences of their policies on economic performance.

Another book published by Servaas Storm and C.W.M. Naastepad titled *Macroeconomics Beyond the NAIRU* (you can find a PDF of it and notes in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tFXFbv06OBg9zVF4tYzImb1xqvkusMp6)) go into the technical aspects of *why* egalitarian policy may be conducive to better economic performance. They offer an entire chapter on the Nordic economies, and put forward a cohesive argument as to why active labor market policy, a generous redistributive system, and robust public spending of these economies being very beneficial for these economies.

I have an entire [sub-folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nyhf-KY9VqE4IyJXgsvyIzijnNiDoqpF) that contains **books** concerning public policy on a wide range of topics - the dreaded Third Way movement, Monetary & Fiscal Policy, the Political Economy of Neoliberalism, etc. Sadly, I have not done notes for these books as I would otherwise be regarded as a book-worm (as if I am not already one!).

I have another [sub-folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1etKy3N0gsQ69tW78AKx_vd2dVoa8yKA4) that contains **articles** concerning Social Democracy, Public Policy, Labor Markets, and Growth Policies -- all of which, I feel, are of much interest to Social Democrats. In this sub-folder of articles, you may find a wide range of topics -- Social/Sovereign Wealth Funds, Welfare Models, the case against austerity, and even a review of COVID-19 Policy.

# Economic Theory

I am not going to detail this section as much as the previous section because I am going to be creating a blogpost introducing the core tenets of Post-Keynesian economics, and an effort-post on this subreddit as well.

As I mentioned, I adhere to the [post-Keynesian](https://www.exploring-economics.org/en/orientation/post-keynesian-economics/) school of economics. [Alex Williams](https://vebaccount.substack.com/p/the-post-keynesian-worldview-in-five) has an excellent article on Post-Keynesian economics, so make sure to check that one out in case you would not like to read the ExploringEconomics website.

If you don't like reading, I did an [interview with the Nordic Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ6Y5951Twk) (man, I feel like I'm bragging too much at this point) and if you think my voice is horrendous (trust me, it is), you may find [Marc Lavoie's lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEROFQIao4o&t=2373s) to be somewhat better.

If you like a modest reading, I highly recommend Marc Lavoie's short book *Introduction to Post-Keynesian Economics* (you can find a PDF of it and notes in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEhnNXNWY3vKJebYvLlxBBqhDN4Kg9g3)).

My good friend Keegs (check out [their Twitter](https://twitter.com/LittleKeegs0)) did a three-part blog summary of Marc Lavoie's book [here](https://jacobmkeegan.medium.com).

If you are interested in learning more about Post-Keynesian economics and how it mingles with other fields (such as Law), I highly recommend joining [the official Post-Keynesian economics Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/CwycB6xmXm)!

"Nearing the 9th anniversary of his death and with relative hindsight in the time since, what are the community's thoughts on Hugo Chàvez?",Liberal,18,t184ia,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/t184ia/nearing_the_9th_anniversary_of_his_death_and_with/,4,"Amid a lot of recent reading on Latin American history and noticing that there hasn't been that recent of a discussion in this sub on this topic, I was curious to see what everyone thinks of Chàvez's legacy. 

My current perception is that he was an incredibly gifted politician and strongly principled towards socialism, nationalizing key industries and made himself a prominent adversary of Yankee imperialism. His advocacy for Panhispanism and Latin American integration is also a high mark of his ideology personally, and seemed to always advocate for the global south on the world stage. 

On the other hand, I feel he made several policy errors and failed to adapt to the conditions of the world economy amid the end of the commodities boom. For better or worse, he was a master of propaganda and messaging, and his eventual use of public funds for these purposes is detrimental to his legacy, and of course something that has continued there to this day. 

Essentially, my basic knowledge has him as a complicated figure, an inspiring and gifted populist who also made several severe errors and perhaps moved too hastily in overwhelming Venezuela's economy in the wake of the commodities boom.

Statement of the Central Committee of the Spartacist League/Britain

JUNE 24 — Standing on our consistent record of proletarian, revolutionary and internationalist opposition to the imperialist-dominated European Union (EU), the Spartacist League/Britain welcomes the decisive vote for a British exit. This is a stunning defeat for the City of London, for the bosses and bankers of Europe as a whole as well as for Wall Street and the US imperialist government. The vote to leave is an expression of hostility from the downtrodden and dispossessed not only to the EU but to the smug British ruling establishment, whose devastation of social services and industry has plunged whole sections of the proletariat into penury.

As we wrote in Workers Hammer (no 234, Spring 2016), calling for a leave vote : “Amid the growing chaos besetting the EU, a British exit would deal a real blow to this imperialist-dominated conglomerate, further destabilising it and creating more favourable conditions for working-class struggle across Europe — including against a weakened and discredited Tory government in Britain. But the failure of Labour and the trade union bureaucracy — like the social democrats and trade union misleaders throughout Europe — to mobilise against the EU has instead ceded the oppositional ground to openly anti-immigrant reactionaries and fascists.”

With anti-EU sentiment running high among working people in France, Spain, Italy and Greece, the vote for Brexit will encourage opposition to the EU elsewhere in Europe. The main purpose of the EU is to maximise the profits of the imperialist ruling classes at the expense of the workers, from Germany to Greece, and of the weaker countries of Europe. The exit of British imperialism could sound the death knell for this inherently unstable capitalist club. Down with the EU! For workers revolution to smash capitalist rule! For a Socialist United States of Europe!

The far right and fascist forces — including UKIP in Britain and the National Front in France — are today rejoicing over “their” victory. UKIP blatantly whipped up vile anti-immigrant racism, including with a disgusting poster implying that thousands of dark-skinned refugees were at Britain’s door. But UKIP hardly has a monopoly on racism: Cameron invoked the spectre of migrant camps similar to the Calais “Jungle” in France moving to England in the event of a British exit. And Labour governments have whipped up anti-immigrant racism just like the Tories. We say: No deportations! Full citizenship rights for all who make it to Britain! Down with racist Fortress Europe!

Those who voted for Brexit did so for a variety of reasons. But only the wilfully blind in the workers movement will see the vote for Brexit as simply a boost for UKIP and the Tory right wing. Cameron has resigned, the Conservatives have been bitterly divided, the capitalist rulers of Europe are in shock. The time is ripe for workers struggles to begin to claw back decades of concessions to the bourgeoisie on wages, working conditions and trade union rights by the reformist union bureaucrats. For a start, the multinational and multiethnic workforce of the NHS should tear up the wretched agreement imposed on junior doctors and mobilise to fight for a revitalised and expanded national health service to provide quality care to all totally free at the point of service. At least the junior doctors fought, unlike Len McCluskey and the rest of the pro-capitalist trade union tops who refused even to mobilise their ranks to fight Cameron’s pernicious new anti-union law. What is needed is a fight for a class-struggle leadership of the unions.

In the wake of the EU’s ravaging of Greece, the “left” Brexit camp, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the Socialist Party offered a half-hearted campaign for a leave vote. From their reformist “old Labour” standpoint, the EU is a barrier to achieving their maximum programme: renationalising British industry under a left Labour government. Faced with closures of the steel plants, this ultimately boils down to a protectionist call to “save British jobs”, which fuels anti-foreigner chauvinism and is counterposed to a class-struggle perspective. The morning after the Brexit vote, the SWP’s crowning demand is: Tories out — for a general election.

A year ago, the same outrage and discontent at the base of society that propelled the vote to leave the EU also fuelled the election of Jeremy Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party, opening the possibility of reforging Labour’s historic links to its working-class base and thus reversing two decades of Blairite schemes to turn Labour into an outright capitalist party. But in campaigning for a remain vote, Corbyn trampled on the interests of the many working people and minorities who looked to him for a change. Crime does not pay: when the results of the referendum came in, Corbyn’s enemies began plotting to remove him from the leadership as soon as possible. It is in the interests of the working class to repulse any and every attempt by Labour’s right wing to regain control of the party.

Today the country is divided — by class, and along regional and national lines. England — outside London — and Wales voted to leave the EU. A majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain, reflecting fears among Catholics that border controls between North and South would be reinstituted. Scotland too voted to remain in the EU, and the SNP has declared that a second referendum on independence is on the agenda. The bourgeois nationalist SNP are committed to maintaining an “independent” Scotland’s membership of the major Western imperialist clubs — the NATO military alliance and the EU. Corbyn’s capitulation to the imperialist EU has deprived working-class opposition to the EU in Scotland (and elsewhere) of a political voice.

The Brexit vote is the second time in the space of a year that the working masses in Europe have voted to repudiate the EU. Last July’s vote in Greece against EU austerity was utterly betrayed by the bourgeois Syriza government, which crawled on its knees before the European banks. The burning question posed is what kind of party does the working class need to represent its interests. The fundamental problems facing the working class cannot be solved within a parliamentary framework. We need a government based on workers councils, which expropriates the capitalist class.

As part of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) we seek to build revolutionary workers parties, in Britain and around the world, rooted in the understanding that only through the mass mobilisation of the working class in struggle can the workers fight for their own interests and act in defence of all the oppressed. Socialist revolutions especially in the economically developed countries of Europe, including Britain, will establish rationally planned economies based on an international division of labour. The overthrow of the capitalist ruling classes and the development of the productive forces under a socialist united states of Europe will open the road to a global socialist society.

When it comes to M4A I support one version or another of a single payer system. To be frank, I don't even support banning private insurance- I just want a national health insurance where people can choose to go private. I'm totally fine with what Australia has since I think that can work best in the frame work of our country. 

I also believe in free trade since we need to stay competitive in this world. Having a globalized world where we have a free exchange of goods and services actually makes countries richer and prosper. We are all given the ability to specialize in areas that we do best in and it gives us the ability to become dominant in certain industries and gain more capital inflows! I believe we can do all this while also having programs to help people displaced by outsourcing and the negative effects of globalization (to prevent demagogues like Trump from getting power).

Do works councils have much power in practice?,Liberal,25,qozwe8,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qozwe8/do_works_councils_have_much_power_in_practice/,2,"I am interested in how much power works councils have with regard to improving worker’s working conditions, preventing unjust firings etc.

I know that in theory they should have a lot of power. For instance, they can veto decisions from management and force management to consult them on certain matters, and in the case that management does not want to make concessions the works council can engage in enforceable codetermination where a labour court judge will vote determine who is in the right with management bearing the costs.

So do works councils have much power in practice? If not, why not? Can they be given more power?

Why, then, do most studies of codetermination act like it conveys no benefits? For example,

> We close the paper by discussing implications of these explanations for recent codetermination proposals in the United States. If existing codetermination arrangements have limited impacts because they intrinsically do not convey much power to workers, then the minority board-level codetermination proposals in the Reward Work Act and Accountable Capitalism Act are likely to have similarly limited effects. By contrast, if codetermination’s limited effects are explained by features of European industrial relations or European labor market institutions that are comparatively absent in the United States, then codetermination could have larger effects (either positive or negative) if implemented in the US. (Jäger et al, “What Does Codetermination Do?”).

I find it very implausible that the fact that codetermination has had so little effects are due to it intrinsically conveying little power to employees because it would seem to convey *at least* as much power as unionization, or at the very least a comparable amount. I’d be more willing to chock up the differences to the fact that Europe has a strong history of collective bargaining that would probably make works councils basically powerless because the union would largely replace them. Workers would be less likely to have grievances when they’re covered by a collective agreement as ~90% of workers are in European countries that also have works councils/codetermination. In addition, if workers have grievances they’d be more likely to go to their union than through their works council. It also doesn’t make sense that an institution that has so much power in theory would totally lack any power whatsoever in practice. So there must be more to why they seem to lack power.",1636325229.0

Question about Germany's energy production in the context of Ukraine and Russia,Liberal,15,sstlh9,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sstlh9/question_about_germanys_energy_production_in_the/,6,"Germany has been seen as not being as willing to engage in conflict with Russia as other countries in Europe. I realize that's a very simplistic take, but the reason for that is presumed to be related to the amount of natural gas that Germany gets from Russia and wants to get in the future, which is a constraint on how tough Germany can be with Russia.

That aside, what is the problem with Germany scaling up its renewables (primarily solar and wind)? Is it a raw materials problem? A lack of capital? A lack of expertise? Why does Germany not already have electric heating in homes powered by renewable energy?

A brief glance at the wikipedia page on German energy policy seems to suggest that Germany is really leaning on regular consumers hard to pay for the transition to renewable energy.

Is it too late to save American democracy?,Liberal,90,rzu7p7,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rzu7p7/is_it_too_late_to_save_american_democracy/,70,"I've developed a rather pessimistic outlook recently. Peter Navarro recently detailed a not implausible and 100% legal way that Trump could have stayed in power despite losing. In effect, what he described was a coup by lawyers (the Green Bay Sweep). You can skip this part and jump to the next paragraph, but here's a brief outline of how it would've worked:
There were 6 key battleground states. The Republicans in congress would have challenged the legitimacy of the electors from those states. By law both chambers must debate this for up to 2 hours. This means that you have (2*6*2=24 hours) of continuous debate over the electors. It is unlikely that the Republicans would have gotten those electors thrown out on their own merits, what the actual plan was was to increase pressure on Pence to decertify these results. This is why the debate is so important, if televised it would increase public pressure on pence from the right to do something.  If pence plays ball, then he would decertify those electors. They would be sent back to republican controlled state legislatures. Most states leave it up to thr state legislature if the voters fail to pick an outcome, and so the state legislators would vote on a board of electors, who would be all pro Trump, and then send that to Washington. Technically, this is all legal. And I am not making this plan up, Navarro literally outlined it in am interview. He calls it the Green Bay Sweep.

Anyways, their plan failed cause of the actions of Pence and a few brave officials in the states. Those folks won't be around for the next election and something like this could happen. Election officials are leaving in droves, 1/3 feel unsafe and 1/6 have seen direct death threats. If this happens again, that's an all American homegrown coup.

Serious action needs to be taken to prevent this, particularly on election law. But it isn't. Some truly terrifying bills have been passed on the state level and partisan officials are taking over certification roles. That's not good

But ultimately, nothing has been done to prevent a sort of Green Bay Sweep 2024.

And that's bad
 
The midterms are coming up which means Republicans will likely have one or both chambers for the next few years, and they'll do what they always do: obstruct. And that means that serious reform is largely impossible post midterm. 

And frankly, as far as I can tell, the dems have done Jack shit to fix this. As much as Republicans say democrats are radical leftist communist Marxist baby eating pedophiles [insert adjective here], they are in reality a coalition of milk toast centrists (Biden Pelosi types) and democratic socialists (AOC sanders types). The centrists very much run the party right now and are caught up in an attempted bipartisanship with a party that has largely rejected democracy at this point. It's not gonna work.

So we basically have till novemeber. And after that we are pretty much fucked.

And I am increasingly scared of what that means for me and the country as a whole

Are we fucked? Am I being too doomer? An interesting thought I haven't heard elaborated much on is that GOP donors are increasingly worried about the instability and trying to roll stuff back. But frankly they don't control the party anymore so idk.....

Background on me: grew up in an upper middle class household, had opportunities presented to me to grow intellectually, socially, and economically that were gate-kept through the ability to afford these privileges - essentially thank you to my parents, I had nothing to do with the exposure I had until I, like many of us eventually do, gained some free will and re-evaluated all that was my life up until this self reflecting convo.

The kicker to all of this is, no one grows up with any innate understanding on how to own and operate a business - it’s a learned skill. Skills require time and resources to pursue. Time and resources are the windfall of having a decent paying job. A decent paying job used to be the norm for most industries (factory worker and janitors affording all they need to for them and their families, as it should be). Now it seems like the regular capitalists look back at what they ‘figured out’ and seem to forget the entire society and family aspect of how they got to where they are at today. Presumably this is why high net worth individuals typically donate their money - there will always be a small few like Cuban that understand money is a facilitator to change and act for the good of many. But capital hoarding is a serious problem for a society with millions of people on the brink.

So I ask, why does it seem like the modern capitalists fail to understand that what they figured out was afforded to them by more than just themselves? Why does it feel like our system is happy with having so many of its citizens concerned for their next rent payment? How could these people be expected to want to adapt to a system that doesn’t appreciate their labor enough to create a living wage? 

I really want to have a dialogue about this - our country is only a generation or two away from collapsing because of the expanding consciousness of the obviously wage slaved members that fundamentally keep this system afloat

They are the *perfect* shills, because they have no idea that their efforts against corporations is just making the corps stronger and more powerful.  

Corporations were created by governments.  Corporations have special privileges and protections from governments.  ""Crony Capitalism"" (Crapitalism!) is all about government doing things on behalf of the corporations, corporate welfare, and legislation to protect corporations from competition.  

The anti-corporatists, while strangely recognizing that corporations influence, subvert, and control government, somehow think that the solution is to give the government MORE power over society, and then government will SOMEHOW be able to resist the influence and subversion by corporations, and thus allow government to control corporations.  Because being able to vote somehow makes government accountable to ""the people"".  Not that that's provided much accountability up to this point.  But it will somehow work better in the future. 

In fact, giving the government more power merely means giving the corporations more power over government, and makes their influence and subversion even more powerful over the rest of society.  

See?  Perfect shills!

There are some few corporations that support libertarianism (cough, Koch Brothers, cough), but the great majority of corporations do NOT support libertarianism.  More importantly, NO corporation, not even the Koch Brothers, really favor the end of government and the creation of an anarchist society.  And for good reason. 

Corporations are dependent upon government for the vast powers they exercise.  Without government privileges and protections, and without the governmental power structure, Corporations have little choice other than to compete for consumers on an equal footing with other businesses.  The large corporate structure and bureaucracy becomes a hindrance without government protectionism.  Corporations would not only NOT become all-powerful in a market anarchist society, it's possible that they may not even be able to exist!

And then there are people who are so confused that they think that corporations using government for their corporate agenda is somehow equivalent to anarcho-capitalism and radical free marketeering.

Taxes for large corporations vs. Small Businesses,Liberal,6,re76td,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/re76td/taxes_for_large_corporations_vs_small_businesses/,6,"I was wondering what you all thought about the concept of having very high corporate taxes on large corporations while having a zero percent tax rate on small businesses.

To my mind it seems like doing this would increase consumer prices by a fair amount, but would also make it easier for small businesses to compete with larger corporations. Would this be good policy? Is it right or wrong to hurt consumers to help prop up small businesses? Or am I misunderstanding something and this perhaps wouldn't actually happen?

Pharmaceutical Drug Prices,Liberal,10,qa57ia,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qa57ia/pharmaceutical_drug_prices/,2,"It seems to me like the cost of pharmaceuticals in the US is insane, but I'm not sure how to fix this problem. Supposedly, pharmaceutical companies receive patents on new drugs for years because this is the only way to incentivize such expensive R&D required for new drugs. But the result is they get effective monopolies on drugs for a decade or so, giving them the ability to price gouge to insane degrees. 

So what is the solution? Either we shorten the monopoly rights of these companies for new drugs, decreasing the incentivization of putting R&D into new drugs, slowing down medical drug advancements. Or we keep doing what we're doing and allow people with health problems to have their lives ruined by exorbitant costs associated with getting the drugs they need to survive. Is R&D subsidization by the government a possible solution or is that a bad idea? 

Also, is there some way to allow more drug imports from other countries to create competition? I suppose the downside to this is that imported drugs may be less effective or even have dangerous side effects, according to the FDA. But maybe for some people less effective/potentially dangerous drugs may be better than no drugs at all.

"Ax tax or sledgehammer tax; a term I've been hearing quite a bit in American progressive circles, not as much online but I don't think it's completely regional either.

This is a term that I've heard repeated quite a bit lately, mostly in face-to-face or digital face-to-face gatherings. The exact term very slightly, but I don't think it's a completely regional expression among progressives. 

Basically it's a punishment tax for billionaires. Essentially it's a incredibly hefty tax levied against the very wealthy, that is devastating, like an axe blow or a hammer blow. A tax of 105% or more. Forces people who make more than a billion dollars, sometimes people who make more than a few hundred million a year, to sell off assets to pay their taxes. Making it fiscally damaging to make that much. 

Also included in this is a number of other theories and elements. This kind of tax also has to come with a change of residence tax; billionaires have no loyalty to their country, and will leave. That usually is to be roughly 70%. I've heard anywhere from the 45 to 90s. I've also heard that there needs to be some sort of forced interest tax on those individuals who would cease to invest their funds if it's kind of tax took place, usually something like 10+%. Basically just enough to eat up there interest or a good portion of it. 


Now the method to implement these taxes and a plutocratic society is a completely different matter.

The Value Amazon brings according to Bezos,Conservative,2,rgjt5t,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/rgjt5t/the_value_amazon_brings_according_to_bezos/,5," **Create More Than You Consume**

 If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out. Remember that stock prices are not about the past. They are a prediction of future cash flows discounted back to the present. The stock market anticipates. I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the past. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer because accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020. 

How about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look at compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion. 

How about third-party sellers? We have an internal team (the Selling Partner Services team) that works to answer that question. They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion. For customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers. We’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of that for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time. 

Customers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are finished in less than 15 minutes. Compare that to the typical shopping trip to a physical store – driving, parking, searching store aisles, waiting in the checkout line, finding your car, and driving home. Research suggests the typical physical store trip takes about an hour. If you assume that a typical Amazon purchase takes 15 minutes and that it saves you a couple of trips to a physical store a week, that’s more than 75 hours a year saved. That’s important. We’re all busy in the early 21st century. So that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventyfive hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each Prime member of about $630. We have 200 million Prime members, for a total in 2020 of $126 billion of value creation. 

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020. Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion. 

Summarizing: Shareholders $21B Employees $91B 3P Sellers $25B Customers $164B Total $301B 

If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation. Of course, our relationship with these constituencies and the value we create isn’t exclusively dollars and cents. Money doesn’t tell the whole story. Our relationship with shareholders, for example, is relatively simple. They invest and hold shares for a duration of their choosing. We provide direction to shareowners infrequently on matters such as annual meetings and the right process to vote their shares. And even then they can ignore those directions and just skip voting. 

Our relationship with employees is a very different example. We have processes they follow and standards they meet. We require training and various certifications. Employees have to show up at appointed times. Our interactions with employees are many, and they’re fine-grained. It’s not just about the pay and the benefits. It’s about all the other detailed aspects of the relationship too. Does your Chair take comfort in the outcome of the recent union vote in Bessemer? No, he doesn’t. I think we need to do a better job for our employees. While the voting results were lopsided and our direct relationship with employees is strong, it’s clear to me that we need a better vision for how we create value for employees – a vision for their success. If you read some of the news reports, you might think we have no care for employees. In those reports, our employees are sometimes accused of being desperate souls and treated as robots. That’s not accurate. They’re sophisticated and thoughtful people who have options for where to work. When we survey fulfillment center employees, 94% say they would recommend Amazon to a friend as a place to work. Employees are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to stretch, get water, use the rest room, or talk to a manager, all without impacting their performance. These informal work breaks are in addition to the 30-minute lunch and 30-minute break built into their normal schedule. We don’t set unreasonable performance goals. We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data. Performance is evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things can impact performance in any given week, day, or hour. If employees are on track to miss a performance target over a period of time, their manager talks with them and provides coaching. Coaching is also extended to employees who are excelling and in line for increased responsibilities. In fact, 82% of coaching is positive, provided to employees who are meeting or exceeding expectations. We terminate the employment of less than 2.6% of employees due to their inability to perform their jobs (and that number was even lower in 2020 because of operational impacts of COVID-19).

Policy Idea: Mandatory Matched Strike Funds,Liberal,8,re4i59,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/re4i59/policy_idea_mandatory_matched_strike_funds/,0,"What if all employees had mandatory contributions towards a strike fund matched by the company, similar to UK pensions?

Each place of work had a local union to administer these funds. The fact that it's mandatory removes the free rider problem and the guaranteed existence of a well funded strike fund disincentivizes willingness of companies to hold out through a strike as they'd still be contributing. 

In a hypothetical scenario, company A takes 2% of all workers wages and puts in into a strike fund. The company then matches the money invested. This strike fund is administered by the democratic workplace union who can choose to affiliate to a larger national or sectoral union for increased resources. Employees are incentivezed through sunk costs to join the union. The union decides company A is low balling them so they strike. Company A still has to match up to 2% of their wages so employees contribute their own funds which are then matched and paid out to workers. Hired scabs are still mandated to contribute towards the strike fund and the company is still obliged to match their contributions. Scabs are therefore incentivezed to join the union and sit out. Companies are disincentivized from hiring scabs because they have to match up to a certain amount what they have to put in. Hiring costs disincentivize trying to bankrupt the strike fund and affiliation to a larger union will add additional money to any strike funds.

Edit: maybe add legislation that prevents temporary workers hired during strikes from benefitting from their strike fund, disincentivizing scab behaviour and preventing them from bleeding the original workers strike fund.",1639243866.0

Am I the mad one?,Liberal,3,snsrld,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/snsrld/am_i_the_mad_one/,6,"This is one of my first text based rants and I didn't want to make it to long so if you have questions or you have suggestions please feel free to comment.

 

Lately I feel like everything around is so messed up in a lot of ways. I feel like everyone is choosing to ignore the fact that we are soon going to reach a point of irreversibility in the sense that soon we will not be able to do anything to stop or slow down climate change (approximately 7 and a half years). And what baffles me is the superficiality around it. 

Constantly we are told by companies that it is down to us to change this. 'Oh, you can save the earth by not driving around so much and by trying to eat less meat'. While yes, these methods work to reduce our individual carbon emissions, it is not merely enough to stop climate change from becoming a problem in the near future. Most of the carbon emissions are from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation. And what is even more surprising is how obvious is the fact that these problems are a fault of the system and how in the current system we cannot stop climate change. 

Furthermore, I would not say that this is a “fault” per se, as one of the main traits of capitalism is to increase the capital of certain people more and more even though it can lead to the destruction of our planet. Michael Parenti said that “The essence of capitalism is to turn nature into commodities and commodities into capital”. This is because Capitalism promotes a growth fetish of capital. It promotes creating an infinite amount of money, even though the resources that it uses to create that capital are finite. This is a main contradiction of Capitalism. You can not have an infinite of something if that something needs something that is finite to be produced. 

Some people may argue that ‘Yes, some companies use fossil fuels a lot however, they do other things to make up for it, for example they plant trees’. To that I present you with studies that show that forests only have a temporary effect as they do have their own lifespans, and trees planted now will not affect the carbon cycle in any way for many years. Also, another big thing that produces a lot of Greenhouse Gases is industrial farming of beef which releases massive amounts of Carbon Dioxide and Methane in the Atmosphere. 

Anyways, I want to say that it is astonishing how we can ignore something like this that endangers billions of people’s lives. Something that will cause famines, extreme poverty, death and extinction of many species and biodiversity. And we can not say that we did not know. Evidence for Climate Change being caused by man has existed since the 1910s-1920s. Over 100 years ago we knew that fossil fuels would destroy the earth at one point and yet we decided that increasing the capital of some people was more important because why not? 

What is to be done about it is a big question that I do not have a fixed answer on, I and other people only have hypotheses, but the big idea is that we can only do trial and error. But I am pretty sure that at the moment we have no other way to counter climate change than by a popular protest or even the creation of a counter culture like the hippies had in the 60-70s. We need protests like the student protests in 1968 France. Although we need to not replicate exactly the past. We know what worked and what didn’t. What we need now is a new counterculture that can make people imagine a better future (an example of this could be the solarpunk culture). We need something that is spiritual, a new way to think, a new way to see, a new way to love and live. We need to get rid of the notion that capital is what a person should be reduced too.",1644349017.0

A different thought on taking back control of female sexuality,Liberal,18,bs5dhq,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/bs5dhq/a_different_thought_on_taking_back_control_of/,10," 

I posted this in another sub, but wanted to share here as well. The more I've thought about it, the more I view it more as a female empowerment issue vs. just a sexual issue. I recently traded private messages with another female redditor in another sub and it made me realize I want to clarify and vocalize these thoughts. I can be a bit extreme/out there in my thoughts sometimes, so here goes.

I recently read a book by Wednesday Martin called ""Untrue."" It was very enlightening and eye opening, but made total sense in light of the events in my own life. It was about the traditional views of women's sexuality and how they are all wrong.  I won't really go into a lot of details about this, but the long and short is, I am married to a man, but about a year ago I started opening up my relationship sexually with a female friend (with his full knowledge). Here are my thoughts of some conclusions as to where my journey has led.

We all know sex is a very powerful force in the world, and while it is and can be a very wonderful thing, it has also been used by men since the dawn of time as a tool of oppression and evil. I know there have been multiple books and essays about how women can use sex to their advantage in the power struggle, and this has always bothered me. It implies that we need to use our bodies to be equals with men, whereas men do not have to do any such thing. Although I fully support exploring ways to equalize power, I do not support a method that requires something not required of men. I suggest something a bit different when it comes to utilizing our sexuality.

I do not speak for all women, but my experience has always been that there is something very different in my relationships with other women compared to those with men. It's not something I can put my finger on, but it is a closeness and an understanding/appreciation that is extremely difficult to attain with a man. The common pitfalls I've had in my male relationships of gaslighting, having the other person wonder ""did I do something"" when I'm just trying to express how I feel, and overall getting me just aren't nearly as prevalent in my female relationships. My closest, emotionally tender moments in life have been shared with my close female friends. I don't think I'm alone, but I would guess a large percentage of women have been in those moments, and there is a moment, even if only briefly, where the lines between friendship/kinship and the feelings of closeness experienced in a romantic/sexual relationship are blurred. In my own life, I have taken those feelings to the next step and allowed that friendship/kinship to progress into sexual expression. Forget labels for a moment. Whether we are bi, lesbian, straight, or identify in any other way, I truly believe that taking that next step into sexual expression is a very natural thing that is a natural extension of the close feelings and emotions in friendship between women.

I really think the only reason this doesn't occur more is because of the world we live in and the stigmas that have been created by a male dominated society. If we could wipe our programming clean, I think these types of connections would happen way more frequently between women, and absent any male involvement. Here is why I think this is important. We are the gatekeepers of sex with the men who have caused the problems (for purposes of this post, I am not referring to gay or bi men who too have been oppressed). If women had more frequent expression of sexual desire with other women, it would do two things:

1. It would take much of the power out of men's hands. We would decide when and how sex involved a man. If we chose to, we would. If not, we don't. But if we were satisfying our sexual desires with other women, that might be adequate for us and we would not have a reason to give in to the patriarchal bullshit that so often governs sex. It leads to a very significant shift in the power dynamic.
2. My experience has taught me that sex with another woman can be very empowering. It is so different in terms of how it effects self-image and confidence. It has changed the way I think about myself and by extension has changed how I interact in my public life. It has nullified some of the confidence and self image issues that I believe are a product of a patriarchal society. I truly believe it would do the same for other women.

I know what I am proposing seems very much out there, and would require a total rethinking of traditional relationships, but I wish more women felt comfortable with this. There is so much we go to our female friends for: affirmation, openness, understanding, etc....why can't sexuality be one of those things? It just seems to fit so naturally into the order of things. It would change so many things as well. I realize many will look at this and say ""But I'm straight, that wouldn't work for me."" I grew up thinking I was 100% straight. Until a little later in life, I didn't give desire for other women a second thought, but I truly believe it's something that would work for almost every woman out there. I think there is so much more this could lead to. It would only strengthen the bonds between women in many different aspects of our lives (personal, career, etc.) and when we are closer and together, we are in a much better position to change the world.",1558630550.0

""This episode is an attempt to wrest control from an independent agency’s chairman with a change in the administration. More than that, it’s an example of the erosion of America’s democracy. Many government institutions are built on norms and practices that encourage parties to work together. This foundation depends on agency leaders who recognize that the long-term benefits of cooperation outweigh the short-term incentive to blow up institutions in pursuit of immediate partisan gains. Since the FDIC’s founding in 1933, all 72 board members have respected that foundation. Until now. 

When I arrived in the U.S. from Yugoslavia alone on my 18th birthday, I had $500 in my pocket. I came to this country with a firm belief in a system of government built upon the rule of law. In the old country, those in power all too often changed the rules and circumvented protocols to enact their preferred policies. When I was sworn in as chairman, I promised myself that I would lead the FDIC with deliberation and due care.""

""In a surprise announcement, McWilliams said she is resigning effective Feb. 4. The move gives President Joe Biden another opportunity to strengthen his hand over bank regulation. McWilliams has been with the FDIC since 2018 and recently sparred with congressional Democrats over proposed changes to how the agency handles bank mergers. Democrats hold a majority on the board, and with board member Martin Gruenberg now set to take over as acting chair, they have sway at the top. Gruenberg has spoken out against the deregulatory actions taken over the past several years at the Federal Reserve that also have drawn sharp criticism from firebrand Sen.

So what policies allow unions to succeed in these countries? The only factors in common that I can think of are broader based bargaining (ie at the industry or even national level). The two outliers, Poland and the UK, both use company level bargaining.

How should the returns on a sovereign wealth fund be spent?,Liberal,6,s0s7im,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/s0s7im/how_should_the_returns_on_a_sovereign_wealth_fund/,2,"I think sovereign wealth funds are a good idea that create a sense of stake in the economy for all citizens. 

One open question is how the returns would be used. 

One option is a citizens dividend. This would basically be a dividend payment going to all citizens regardless of age, income etc. Because of the breadth, the returns on even a relatively large SWF would translate to relatively modest returns for the average citizen. As an example, Norway’s fund is worth over 200K per citizen and ha saveraged 5.9% returns, which means each citizen would receive 12K a year. Norway’s polices probably aren’t exactly replicable, but even half that size would be a significant return.

The other option is general government spending. This would presumably be more ‘smart’, as you could lower taxes. Using the returns to fund targeted welfare would be more progressive to boot. 

There are probably other options I’ve missed.

Unions are going to be ignored even more than they are already. Poverty (which mostly affects young families and homes with children) will likely rise. Russia's money will go straight to war or to Donetsk and Luhansk, two regions that should be Ukraine's problem to begin with.

As some Russians were saying yesterday, there were no income supports during the COVID lockdown because the money wasn't there. Now it turns out we have the cash for adventurism in Europe.

However I am burdened by trying to understand why these profit seeking collectives wouldn't join forces to protect their interests and thus lead us back into centralized government.

What changes in attitude or changes to the world at large are necessary to bring about a stabilized anarchy?

Well the good news is that global government mismanagement combined with technological advances is causing a power struggle. If change continues to advance more rapidly than human bureaucracy can cope with, then small groups of people who understand and can utilize those technologies will be freed from the bureaucracy. As technology advances and branches out we may see governments become more or less obsolete. 

However, I'm not certain this will be a good thing for the majority of the slave class. Those who stay on the cutting edge of the new technologies (automation) will be employed by corporations, while those who have no skills to offer these corporations will find they have nowhere to turn to.

When I meander down these thought-paths I always come back to the same conclusion. We humans have multiple problems, but the principle problems are that most communities around the world have outsourced many of their essential needs production (food and water), and we have too many people on this planet.

Because most communities are dependent upon other communities for food and water, changes that affect availability or prices of those commodities must move in lockstep globally or people face starvation or dehydration. We have so many people that disruptions in these markets often cause human suffering.

What exactly is the incentive for managing this complex network of food and water for 7billion people when the corporations running everything only need less than 1billion to create an indefinitely self-sustaining peak civilization?

I'm not saying that it is impossible for the Earth to support 7billion people (though some do make that argument) but that human populations grew faster than our ability to sustainably support our level of population and growth.

Now, if you told me I got the position because I was a gay arab man well I would punch you in the face (Don't mess with me I've been working out and taking boxing classes. JK!). You see to gain a position just because of immutable characteristics is extremely unamerican. You work hard, you gain experience, you teach yourself. That's what it's about not race and I know luck has so many things to do with it such as being born into a rich family.

Of course for me I would love to see a gay arab man become a supreme court justice that would be absolutely amazing! But I would only love to see it, if it was deserved, because what does it matter if a gay arab man becomes a supreme court justice if he wasn't the most qualified candidate. I want to see a gay arab man rise above the heterosexuals, the whites, e.t.c.. I want to see him rise because of his grit, hard work, persistence, and knowledge not because he's gay and arab.

Just had to share this because it's really bothering me lately how many people that I watch want to say that people don't support this because they're racist, but that is so far from the truth.",1643828346.0
Socialist in r/socialist do support and believe in existing socialist governments...,Conservative,0,su9pnd,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/su9pnd/socialist_in_rsocialist_do_support_and_believe_in/,29,"The link at the bottom is for a post in r/socialism where a user tells everyone they should be supporting existing socialist governments.

Socialism is not a philosophy. Socialism is an Anti Philosophy full of many contradictions. What does it even mean that the workers own and control the means of production? Which workers and to what extend and which means of production? Who actually is in charge of making all the decisions if everyone controls everything...? A real libertarian knows that when everyone owns and controls everything than no one owns or controls anything... Hence why you end up with some asshole who controls everything and everyone under the guise for the sake of the greater good or for the workers in socialist countries...

The socialist believe in destroying capitalism, and destroying fascism and all counter revolutionaries. Marx talk about a ""bloody revolution"". Neo Liberals also get put in front of the firing squad so dont think that just because you're a watered down leftist you'll avoid it.  There is a reason why right wingers believe in gun rights. 

The means to destroying capitalism is vanguardism. Vanguardism is when a left wing government takes control of everything and everyone. And is used to socialize the economy and nationalize everything and destroy all opposition. Thats the first stage of socialism. Thats dictatorship of the proletarian. Thats the excuse they use for why people should support China, Laos, Cuba and even North Korea.  And if you dont support these governments well than you are just brain wash by ""The red scare"" Anti Communist US propaganda... 

I read a lot of post about socialism on the internet. And its not always the case that they are this honest. Thats why I took the time to link it. 

I think the difference between a socialist libertarian and a socialist is that socialist libertarian might not actually believe in vanguardism.

-------------------------------------------

Hello. There's seemingly a daily question on whether social democrats are socialists, whether individuals on this sub think socialism is the end goal, what socialism means, what the difference is. 

Truth is: I really don't care. I've variously identified as a card-carrying social democrat, a socialist, a democratic socialist or a market socialist in the past 15 years. I've sat on socdem party boards, implemented campaigns and policies. I've been in the room when it was decided what our policy priorities were in my city, region and nation state. Not once was the question whether this is socialist of relevance. In this post, I want to convince you to adopt the same outlook.

----------------------------------

**What I want**

OK, this section could be called *what social democrats want* but I suppose I can't speak for everyone. But here's what I stand for, what I fight and campaign for.

- **Freedom**

The freedom for everyone. Freedom from the fear of losing your job or getting sick. Freedom to say and do what you want. To live in a pluralistic society what allows for the pursuit of happiness. Yes, this implies a welfare state, because it is the welfare state - whether organized by the state, through trade unions or what have you - that guarantees a life free of freedom. Strong protections against the economic danger of losing my job, or disability, make me *free* to live without fear. 

- **Justice**

We can discuss what kind of social justice we need - whether it's equality of opportunity or equality of outcome - but let's not loose sight of the plan: To live in a society where everyone is equal, where everyone can live a good life independent of gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, religion, class, origin and nationality. 

This also implies positive rights. Rights for good education, good work, housing and health. Rights that assure us a good life.

It also implies redistributive justice. I do not believe a society with large wealth disparities is just. In fact, it implies something for the world: I don't think our earth is just with large wealth disparities both between countries and individuals. 

- **Solidarity**

My party [says (in German)](https://www.sp-ps.ch/sites/default/files/documents/sp_parteiprogramm_kurzfassung_dt_0_0.pdf) that solidarity is the ""intentional partisanship for the oppressed, the exploited, the socioeconomically deprived and for the threatened nature. [It is] a matter of working for all instead the few, for those living today as well as those born later, in our own country and worldwide."". I really don't think I can put it better. I would add that I also want solidarity in my life, not just my politics. A solidaric neighbourhood rather than individualized suburbs, but we can discuss this.

- **Broadening democracy**

It's also about broadening democracy. To make sure political decisions involve all those impacted, but also to democratize our economy. Capitalism in its current form is not the end of history, and we *can shape the future*. I want an economy that works for society and the people, not a people that work for the economy. True freedom, for me, involves something beyond the current state where my life and work is externally controlled. Democracy is the way to truly liberate us. 

**How we get there**

It's pretty clear to me that this cannot be achieved by a violent, Leninist-Trotzkyite revolution. in fact, such a revolution would go against pretty much all core tenets of what I want. instead, it looks to me like incrementalism and convincing others of these core tenets the way forward. 

**Markets or not?**

Half of you regularly profess your love for markets. Awesome. I love markets when they properly function. If we're to ever go into the direction I suggest, I would anticipate markets will remain in plenty areas of the economy - although likely with plenty regulation -, while others (healthcare, education) may not. Markets are awesome price finding mechanism, but heck, a case can be made that injustice, and unfreedom, are not helpful for functioning markets.

**Is this socialism?**

I *really* don't care. Some call this democratic socialism (the paper I link above does). Some call this social democracy. Some call this post-capitalism. In the end, this boils down what, exactly, you mean by these words. I'm entirely uninterested in these discussions (surprisingly, given that I study philosophy, which you can find out about me in 2 seconds). 

Should you care? No. If you subscribe to those core tenets, and I anticipate plenty if not all of you do, then you should not. Call it whatever fits you at any given point. If you talk to Bernieytes, call it socialism for all I care. If you talk to your conservative uncle, call it Christian democracy. If you want to call yourself a socialist, go ahead. If you don't, fine by me.

**Thanks for reading**

stateless-society: How-to institutional knowledge,Conservative,0,35eeun,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/35eeun/statelesssociety_howto_institutional_knowledge/,8,"I'm not a liberalist, capitalist or any other *ist* 
I'm simply looking to escape out of my echo-chamber/bubble.

**Context**

Large organizations like Governments perform lots of tasks, 
most of these are dependant on institutional knowledge.

This creates an enormous amount of momentum.

My observation is that distributed organizations that cropped up
online were only effective for a short while, like actions against ACTA etc.
Those were organized on social media platforms like facebook. But that platform has largely been neutralized by the advent of click-farms in Asia as well as algorithms
that optimize for happy-feelings rather than relevance.

The social media political movements have fizzled out, because nobody bothered
to create durable long-lasting connections or a method to preserve
institutional knowledge. 

Hence all the momentum has dispersed. There are more people then ever before that desire for socio-economic change, but all the rage and energy evaporates in rants rather then adding to the momentum of a movement that builds up until it can break through
the barriers put up by those that benefit from the status quo.

**My question** how to have a big organization with institutional knowledge & momentum without the trappings like corruption that accompany centralization & hierarchies.

On the events in Belarus,Liberal,3,ilslzo,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/ilslzo/on_the_events_in_belarus/,0," What is going on in Belarus is not a “maidan”, it’s a democratic revolution.

The main moving force of this revolution, its backbone, is the working class of Belarus.

Whether this democratic revolution will win or get defeated by the counter-revolution (presented by the yet not overthrown clan of oligarchs led by Lukashenko or presented by the so-called “opposition” reflecting the interests of other groups of the largest capitalist monopolies, including foreign ones), we do not know yet – it will depend on the ratio of the class power in Belarus, on the actions of the classes participating in the revolution, on the working class, on its awareness, cohesiveness and organization.

The democratic revolution in Belarus is not yet going beyond the bourgeois framework and is not seeking to change the social structure radically (to replace the capitalist way of production with the communist way of production), which means that, in its content, this is a bourgeois-democratic, anti-imperialist, anti-fascist revolution. But due to the objective laws of social development, if the leadership (the hegemony) of the working class remains, if the latter manages to coalesce into its class political party of the Bolshevik variety and unite all working folk of Belorussia around itself, this revolution will have every chance to grow into a socialist revolution.

"Why anarcho-capitalism *almost* works, but doesn't.",Conservative,0,141fxv,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/141fxv/why_anarchocapitalism_almost_works_but_doesnt/,6,"There are two things that prevent anarcho-capitalism from being viable: Standards of goods and services, and intellectual investment.

Allow me to explain: in any economy, capitalist, redistributed, or otherwise, there are incentives to create value profitably for goods and services. This necessarily means that producers of these will seek the most optimum margins for profit of these goods and services: this is exactly the right thing to do, but it leads, seemingly inevitably, to the incentive of expedience as a way to facilitate this, which is a very good thing until that expedience causes those goods and services to become dangerous.

Take a light switch, for example.  There are standards and regulations that describe how much current they should be capable of withstanding, the materials they should be constructed of, the way they should be installed, the physical aesthetics they should adhere to, and so on.  Without these standards, light switches- or any commodity item- will be subject to competition switches built to unspecified standards, using materials that may or may not put the function of the switch or the safety of the users at risk, chosen to produce that switch at lower cost, with lower cost to the consumer.

This, in itself, is a problem, but not a big one.  The big problem with this is the consequences: cheap parts, subject to dangerous usage, will inevitably lead to damage, or if you want to keep track of this, the loss of items or functionality of financial value (including human life, which has value that can be measured using money to assess that value).  

And so the situation occurs when losses are caused by people making decisions that were expediently beneficial, and now the problem should become clear: how is that lost value repaid, and how is a person without enough value to be held to account when they can't repay the damages they have caused?  If life were simple, it would be their own loss: use a shitty switch, your own house burns down, and you die in a fire.  But life has put most of the world close together- in apartments, joined homes, or in buildings very near each other, and damage is inevitable.  Who must be held to account for it, how, and who is actually to blame?

If I install my own light switch in my apartment that causes a fire that kills everybody and destroys the building, is it my fault for buying a switch that was unsafe, whether I knew it or not? is it the land lord's, for not installing a safer switch? is it the fault of the manufacturer for not producing a safer switch? is it the fault of the other residents, for living with a neighbor as dumb as me? What if I had no choice- if I'm poor and can only afford the cheapest switch, am I more to blame for not capitalizing on opportunities as well as others? if there is only one switch available, is it the retailer's fault for not stocking others? is it the fault of manufacturers who could have produced safer switches to compete with this one, but didn't? Is it everybody's fault- but if so, what portion of blame does anybody share? Even if everything is insured, is the loss less tangible because it has been transferred to an agency that seeks to capitalize on presumed risk of loss, and which has incentives to not recognize and cover the loss- perhaps by blaming me for installing a switch which was not covered under the insurance plan?


The second problem is intellectual investment.  In a broad sense, this covers both research and development and intellectual property.  I won't stand up and defend the patent system as it is here, because it has many problems, but it is a means of captalizing that, since it is regulated, is also a means of exchange (briefly: if I design a helicopter and patent it, but have no capability or interest in producing it, patents let me captitalize on this anyway by selling the rights to the idea, even though I'm just a person, and the buyer would likely be a large company or syndicate that I would be unable to compete with on equal terms otherwise).

So: creativity, research, design, invention, iteration on designs or solutions, and discovery all have monetary value, all are the result of investment by the people accomplishing these tasks, and the inability of these people to compete with established players in a market can be considered an opportunity cost that is exactly equal to the value their work alone increases in the market that they do not benefit from financially, despite any attempts to do so.

There are at least two possible situations directly following, and a further lost opportunity from the (also seemingly inevitable) result of keeping the fruits of this labor secret.

First, there is the case where the secret is eventually successfully implemented by a competitor, which relies on investment by the competitor in independent research and attempts, as well as other costs such as reverse engineering, and is further complicated because the time this takes may or may not give the secret's original discoverer time to capitalize on it and be able to compete in an existing marketplace: an example is the telescoped locking head lug mechanism in bolt action rifles, which a german inventor developed and was able to capitalize on, but which was eventually implemented elsewhere independently; there are plenty of other examples here, and all induce risk that can be mitigated with some form of regulation, even de-facto consensus.

The second case is that the secret can never be replicated, and dies with the creator or discoverer; in this case, the entire human species experiences a tangible financial loss in the form of decreased operating capacity.

Finally,the lost opportunity is for iterations on development as a result of secrecy: imagine if petrol engines were a secret, kept in locked boxes, only opened by their inventor; we would not have diesel engines, or rotary engines, or any of the other things inspired by the design- or as a best case scenario, we would have the opportunity cost of the time it took for those other things to be independently derived.

So, these are the apparent achilles heel in anarcho-capitalism; it results in unnecessary debt or opportunity cost as a direct result of attempts to capitalize.  This doesn't mean that the entire idea must be scrapped: it means that these issues must be addressed meaningfully, honestly acknowledged, and solutions found for them.",1354254495.0

* Which laws could decisively dismantle these monopolies and promote more competitors to join in?
* What incentive could be created to promote fair competition that could benefit us all?
* What could stop simulated shortages from oligarchs and create abundance in services and products?

A typical example is a recent [bill in the South Carolina legislature](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess124_2021-2022/bills/4605.htm), which attempts to hijack the framing of social justice to suppress anti-establishment viewpoints by labeling them as ""inherently discriminatory"". One that stood out to me was the following:

>meritocracy or traits and behaviors such as a hard work ethic, punctuality, use of standard English language are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race or group to oppress another race or group

I'm trying to figure out exactly what they are referring to so that I can have a better understanding of these issue (rather than the right-wing caricature). I'm guessing that the meritocracy arguments refer to the likes of Lani Guinier's ""[the tyranny of the meritocracy](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/03/qa-lani-guinier-about-her-new-book-college-admissions)"" and the broader idea that meritocracy is used as a 'just so' story to justify existing dominance hierarchies. The other issues (hard work, punctuality, 'standard' English) could have a few interpretations. Again, they could be 'just so' stories to justify existing hierarchies; they could also cultural norms beaten into the working class to make them easier to exploit, or they could be more general cultural imperialism.

I wanted to learn more about the intersection of cultural imperialism and racism, and was surprised that I did not find any straight-forward, easily accessible summaries of the issue via a Google search. Could you all make any recommendations?

Could randomly choosing people to serve in government be the best way to select our politicians?,Liberal,18,oq8eys,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/oq8eys/could_randomly_choosing_people_to_serve_in/,22,"I'm a huge advocate of something known as **[sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)**, where people are randomly selected to serve in a legislature. Unfortunately the typical gut reaction against sortition is bewilderment and skepticism. How could we possibly trust ignorant, stupid, normal people to become our leaders? 


# Democracy by Lottery

**Imagine a Congress that actually looks like America. It's filled with nurses, farmers, engineers, waitresses, teachers, accountants, pastors, soldiers, stay-at-home-parents, and retirees. They are conservatives, liberals, and moderates from all parts of the country and all walks of life.**

In the most commonly discussed implementation of sortition, lottery would be used to construct a legislature. Random sampling would be used to draw around 100 to 1000 people to form a house of Congress. Service would be voluntary, for a fixed term, and be well paid. From there, the selected people would have the responsibilities and powers of any elected legislature. These sorts of legislatures would have substantial advantages against elected ones:

* Because of [random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\)), a sortition Citizens' Assembly would have superior diversity in every conceivable dimension compared to any elected system, including race, class, sex, religion, ideology, cognitive ability, profession, and anything else you can think of. Sortition is therefore the ultimate method of creating a [proportionally representative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) Congress. 
* Without the threat of elections demanding ideological purity, a sortition assembly is better able to compromise with their fellow citizens and reach consensus. 
* Without the need for elections, legislators no longer need to waste time campaigning but can rather focus their time on their actual job.
* Legal bribery in the form of campaign donations is eliminated. 
* The nature of lottery creates a more egalitarian Congress ruled by regular people rather than the elites of society. 
* The nature of lottery possibly crushes the formation of political parties - parties that often form due to strategic campaigning needs to win elections. 



# Real World Evidence

Sortition is not a shower-thought. Sortition is thousands of years old and is the topic of active investigation by political scientists. Hundreds of sortition-based [Citizens' Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) across the world have already been conducted. The decisions they have come to have been of high quality in my opinion. For example:

 * The BC Columbia Citizens Assembly was tasked with designing a new electoral system to replace the old [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) (FPTP) system. The organizers brought in university experts. The organizers also allowed citizens, lobbyists, and interest groups to speak and lobby. Assembly members listened to all the sides, and they decided that the lobbyists were mostly bullshit, and they decided that even though the university experts had biases, they were more trustworthy. This assembly ultimately, nearly unanimously decided that Canada ought to switch to a [Single-Transferable-Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) style election system. They were also nearly unanimous in that they believed FPTP voting needed to be changed. This assembly demonstrates the ability of normal people to learn and make decisions on complex topics. 
 * In [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)), Citizen Assemblies were instrumental in the legalization of both gay marriage and abortion in a traditionally Catholic country. These assemblies were used to resolve politically volatile subjects so that fearful politicians would not have to. 
 * Recent 2019-2020 Citizen Assemblies in Ireland and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Convention_for_Climate) reached consensus on sweeping, broad reforms to fight climate change. In Ireland taxes on carbon and meat were broadly approved. In France the People decided to criminalize ""ecocide"", raise carbon taxes, and introduce regulations in transportation and agriculture. Liberal or conservative, left or right, near unanimous decisions were made on many of these proposals.
 * [America in One Room](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/america-one-room-experiment.html) deliberative polling experiments have demonstrated the ability of regular Americans to deliberate amongst one another and come to compromises. 

The usage of sortition has also been documented in many societies:

* The greatest known example of sortition is its use in ancient Athens, where lottery was used to select magistrates, legislative councils, and the People's Court. 
* Sortition was also used in combination with elections for the selection of leadership in Renaissance-era Italian City States such as a Venice and Florence. 
* Examples of sortition have also been documented to be used in [Indian tribes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12651). In these tribes, sortition results in an egalitarian government where power is shared. When elections were introduced into these societies however, the author observed the rise in power hierarchies and even ""toxic masculinity"". 


In these societies, you will find echoes of the claims I made above. Political parties in these societies are weak. Concentrations of power are reduced. 

# Comparing to Elections

All electoral methods are a system of choosing a ""natural aristocracy"" of societal elites. This has been claimed by philosophers such as Aristotle since ancient Greek elections 2400 years ago. Elections are biased in favor of those with wealth, affluence, and power. 

Moreover all voters, including you and me, are [rationally ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance). We don't have the time nor resources to adequately monitor and manage our politicians. On average we vote ignorantly, oftentimes solely due to party affiliation, or the name or gender of the candidate, rather than actual qualification. We assume *somebody else* is doing the monitoring, and hopefully we'd read about it in the news. And yes, it is somebody else. Marketers, advertisers, lobbyists, and specialists pay huge sums of money to influence your opinion and construct your news reality. Every elections is a hope that we can refine our ignorance into competence. IN CONTRAST, in sortition, normal citizens are given the time, resources, and education to become informed using the process of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy). Normal citizens are given the opportunity to deliberate with one another and come to compromise. IN CONTRAST, politicians constantly refuse to compromise for fear of upsetting ignorant voters - voters who did not have the time nor opportunity to research the issues in depth. Our modern, shallow, ignorant management of politicians has led to an era of unprecedented polarization, deadlock, and government ineptitude. 


# Implementations

There are many forms which sortition could take. I list some from least to most extreme:

* The least extreme is the use of Citizen Assemblies or Deliberative Polling in an advisory capacity for legislatures or referendums. Examples of these have been implemented in Ireland, the UK, France. They have also been implemented in Oregon in the form of ""Citizens Initiative Review"" (CIR). Here, a random body of Oregonians are tasked with reviewing ballot propositions and giving referendum voters information about the propositions. 
* A hybrid, two-house Congress has been proposed where one house is chosen by lottery while the other remains elected. This system attempts to balance the pro's and con's of both sortition and election, and use both as checks and balances against each other.
* Random sortition legislators can also be added to existing parliamentary bodies to complement, rather than veto, the decision making capabilities of elected officials. 
* Rather than have citizens directly govern, random citizens can be used exclusively as intermediaries to elect and fire politicians as a sort of electoral college. The benefit here is that citizens are given the time and resources to deploy a traditional hiring & managing procedure to make political appointments. This system removes the typical criticism that you can't trust normal people to govern and write laws.
* Most radically, [multi-body sortition](https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/428/) constructs checks and balances by creating several sortition bodies - one decides on what issues to tackle, one makes proposals, one decides on proposals, one selects the bureaucracy, etc, and completely eliminates elected office. 



# The History of Sortition
Democratic lotteries are an ancient idea whose usage is first recorded in ancient Athens in 6th century BC. Athens was most famous for its People's Assembly, in which any citizen could participate (and was paid to participate) in direct democracy. However, the Athenians also invented several additional institutions as checks and balances on the passions of the People's Assembly.

* First, the Council of 500, or the Boule, were 500 citizens chosen by lottery. This group developed legislative proposals and organized the People’s Assemblies.
* In addition, lottery was used to choose the composition of the People’s Court, which would check the legality of decisions made by the People’s Assembly. 
* Most government officials were chosen by lottery from a preselected group to make up the Magistracies of Athens. 
Athens used a mixture of both election and lottery to compose their government. Positions of strategic importance, such as Generals, were elected. 

## Historical Beliefs about Democracy 

Athenian democracy was regarded by Aristotle as a “radical democracy”, a state which practiced the maxim “To be ruled and rule by turns” [2 pp. 71]. For Aristotle, “It is accepted as democratic when public offices are allocated by lot; and as oligarchic when they are filled by election.” 

Renaissance writers thought so too. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu states, “Voting by lot is the nature of democracy; voting by choice is in the nature of aristocracy.”

How is it that ancient and Renaissance philosophers understood democracy to be selection by lottery, while modern people understand democracy to be a system of elections? Democracy was redefined by Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville while he travelled through the United States in the early 1800’s. Tocqueville was impressed by the equality of the social and economic conditions of Americans in the early years of the republic. Importantly, Tocqueville believed that the institutions of American “township democracy”, law, and the practice of the tyranny of the majority made America a land of democracy. Therefore he wrote and titled a book, *Democracy in America*, that redefined America as a democracy rather than the aristocratic republic which its founding fathers had desired. Tocqueville’s book would become a best-seller around the world. 

With Tocqueville’s redefinition of democracy that excluded the practice of lot, the traditions of democracy were forgotten and replaced with the electoral fundamentalism of today. From historican & advocate David Reybrouck, 

> “Electoral fundamentalism is an unshakeable belief in the idea that democracy is inconceivable without elections and elections are a necessary and fundamental precondition when speaking of democracy. Electoral fundamentalists refuse to regard elections as a means of taking part in democracy, seeing them instead as an end in themselves, as a holy doctrine with an intrinsic, inalienable value.” [1 pp 39].



# Concluding Remarks

There are many legitimate arguments against sortition, and these philosophical arguments have been waged for thousands of years since democracy's invention. We might assume that yes, there are superior people, and that the superior ought to lead the inferior irrespective of the inferiors' wishes. If you believe in this kind of superiority, democracy is not for you, and elections aren't for you either (How ridiculous is it to ask the inferior to select the superior!). But if you do believe in democracy, if you believe that people ought to govern over themselves, then I think you need to take sortition seriously as a way to enhance democracy and finally take it to the 21st century.

They monitor periods, deny abortions including babies of rape, delay release to force women to gestate unwanted babies, refuse to issue masks or gloves, and now we know they're performing hysterectomies on women without their consent.  Some women had their ovaries removed, sending them into menopause unconscionably early.  The lack of medical care for such serious, unnecessary surgeries surely added to the high mortality rate.  This is the latest in a long history of forced sterilization, genocide, and other horrors piled on black and brown people by the white men in charge. 

We cannot allow anyone to control women's bodies.  These kinds of things happen too often.  This is why we must protect bodily autonomy: all women in the US, regardless of citizenship, must have complete control over themselves including their reproductive choices.  To allow others control over women's bodies results in horrors.

A quick breakdown:

Keynesian: Recessions happen when bad news spooks consumers and investors who cut back on spending. Wages get stuck in place above equilibrium, causing unemployment. We will be stuck there until planned investment expenditure is restored. 

Austrian: Recessions are the inevitable consequence of an economic boom fueled by easy credit (too much money printing) that leads investors to make bad investments. 

Monetarist: Keynesian except the cause isn’t bad news is negative monetary shocks. 

New Classical: Monetarist except is *unexpected* negative monetary shocks and people’s expectations are right on average. 

Real Business Cycle Theory: Events out of our control reduce labor productivity and people wisely exit labor markets. Recessions are not a deviation from a “trend”, they represent an economy at equilibrium. Only supply-side solutions help. 

New Keynesian: New Classical except nominal wage rigidity (wages change slowly) means the Fed can basically smooth out the business cycle with competent monetary policy.

well how is this capitalism's fault? you see, capitalists only care for their own profit. food, water, vaccines, etc can all be distributed to countries that need them. just look at afghanistan for example. western countries were able to evacuate thousands of afghans, yet they aren't able to distribute food, water, and vaccines? another example, why does the UN have to ask elon musk to end world hunger? why can't they ask the u.s? this is because it's not profitable for the u.s to end it. furthermore, i firmly believe that it should be normalized that capitalism kills 20 million per year. thoughts?


edit: there was an error in my math, malaria actually kills 600,000 per year. ive also decided to add more issues which kill millions

I personally realize the capitalist nature of the US (EU, NATO, ...) and also that Russia is an oligarchy. Therefore I say that a war would in fact not serve anyone but the leaders. And even then I question, what value really is to be won here for these rulers.

And though I consider peace to be the most valuable asset of our lifetimes, I wonder how the conflict should be treated. Russia rightfully feels threatened by the convergence of borders through the expansion of NATO  in former Soviet states. The EU and NATO claim to act in solidarity with  the Ukraine, though these statements rather sound like imperialist none sense.

Please Explain the Benefit of Democratic Socialism For the Economy as a Whole,Liberal,3,st81bm,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/st81bm/please_explain_the_benefit_of_democratic/,7,"Hi everyone,   


I am new to this subreddit and come with a good intentioned open question hoping to learn! I am not against democratic socialism fully in anyway! I am an economist, researcher, PhD. A lot may not know this but it is widely taught at universities that many of the theories that drive Democratic Socialism are proven to have harmful effects on the economy for the masses. However, Democratic Socialism still garners a lot of support by intelligent individuals.   


My research allows me to look at the scientific side of demographic socialism, but I believe you learn a lot by talking to the supporters themselves. So will someone please explain the argument for Democratic Socialism having a positive impact on the economy for the masses when dealing with large developed countries such as the United States?

One current example is the energy industry in the UK, really what's happening could quite easily have been predicted, these energy companies make a LOT of money. Currently the government are now talking about raising the energy price cap, a measure which was specifically introduced to protect consumers from unexpected price hikes. Why do they not have reserves put aside to weather the storm? 

It feels as if once you get to a certain size in our capitalist economies, you get to stop playing by the rules which effect every other small business.

Here are lists of racist quotiations from Marl Karx's,


“The Jewish n(word) Lassalle who, I’m glad to say, is leaving at the end of this week, has happily lost another 5,000 talers in an ill-judged speculation. The chap would sooner throw money down the drain than lend it to a ‘friend,’ even though his interest and capital were guaranteed. ... It is now quite plain to me—as the shape of his head and the way his hair grows also testify—that he is descended from the negroes who accompanied Moses’ flight from Egypt (unless his mother or paternal grandmother interbred with a n(word)). Now, this blend of Jewishness and Germanness, on the one hand, and basic negroid stock, on the other, must inevitably give rise to a peculiar product. The fellow’s importunity is also
n(word)-like.” Karl Marx, “Marx to Friedrich Engels in Manchester,” 1862
Tremaux


 “proved that the common Negro type is the degenerate form of a much higher one ... a very significant advance over Darwin.” Karl Marx, letter to Friedrich Engels, August 7, 1866



“Without slavery, North America, the most progressive of countries, would be transformed into a patriarchal country. Wipe out North America from the map of the world and you will have anarchy— the complete decay of modern commerce and civilization. Abolish slavery and you will have wiped America off the map of nations.” Karl Marx, “The Poverty of Philosophy,” 1847




“Take Amsterdam, for instance, a city harboring many of the worst descendants of the Jews whom Ferdinand and Isabella drove out of Spain and who, after lingering a while in Portugal, were driven out of there too and eventually found a place of retreat in Holland. ... Here and there and everywhere that a little capital courts investment, there is ever one of these little Jews ready to make a little suggestion or place a little bit of a loan. The smartest highwayman in the Abruzzi is not better posted about the locale of the hard cash in a traveler’s valise or pocket than these little Jews about any loose capital in the hands of a trader ... These small Jewish agents draw their supplies from the big Jewish houses ... and practice great ostensible devotion to the religion of their race.” Karl Marx, “The Russian Loan,” 1856



“What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. ... Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades
all the gods of man—and turns them into commodities. ... The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange. ... The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.” Karl Marx, “On the Jewish Question,” 1844



“This splendid territory [the Balkans] has the misfortune to be inhabited by a conglomerate of different races and nationalities, of which it is hard to say which is the least fit for progress and civilization. Slavonians, Greeks, Wallachians, Arnauts, twelve millions of men, are all held in submission by one million of Turks, and up to a recent period, it appeared doubtful whether, of all these different races, the Turks were not the most competent to hold the supremacy which, in such a mixed population, could not but accrue to one of these nationalities.” Karl Marx, “The Russian Menace to Europe,” 1853




“Thus we find every tyrant backed by a Jew, as is every Pope by a Jesuit. In truth, the cravings of oppressors would be hopeless, and the practicability of war out of the question, if there were not an army of Jesuits to smother thought and a handful of Jews to ransack pockets. ... The fact that 1,855 years ago Christ drove the Jewish money-changers out of the temple, and that the money-changers of our age, enlisted on the side of tyranny, happen again to be Jews is perhaps no more than a historic coincidence.” Karl Marx, “The Russian
 Loan,” 1856

“The expulsion of a Leper people from Egypt, at the head of whom was an Egyptian priest named Moses. Lazarus, the leper, is also the basic type of the Jew.” Karl Marx, letter to Friedrich Engels, May 10, 1861



“Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were fantasy-mongers, that the Israelites were idolators ... that the tribe of Simeon (exiled under Saul) had moved to Mecca where they built a heathenish temple and worshipped stones.” Karl Marx, letter to Engels, June 16, 1864



“Indian society has no history at all, at least no known history. What we shall call its history is but the history of the successive invaders who founded their empires on the passive basis of that unresisting and unchanging society.” Karl Marx, New York Daily Tribune, August 8, 1853




“Russia is a name usurped by the Muscovites. They are not Slavs, do not belong at all to the Indo-German race, but are des intrus [intruders], who must again he hurled back beyond the Dnieper, etc.” Karl Marx, letter to Friedrich Engels, June 24, 1865",1645409929.0

“Bastiat Mask” is a likeness of the 19th-century French economic journalist Frederic Bastiat, manifest as a hastily fashioned, two-dimensional mask. It is the type of mask that can be held to one’s face, as in a masquerade ball, by the wooden stick that appears stapled to its bottom.

Curiously, rather than having two eye holes set in their traditional locations, Bastiat Mask features only one, cut into the middle of the forehead, the “third eye” position. It is the artist’s fantasy that, should one look through this supernatural eye hole as they adorn their faces with the mask, they would be able to see what Bastiat saw through his own mind’s eye. They would become privy to a worldview that renders the once-murky understanding of money and commerce instantly clear, their fractured thoughts about the nature of an economy mended, and erroneous notions about *laissez-faire* banished.

It is Bastiat’s mystical “third eye” that is singularly equipped to grant access to his vision precisely because it was an enlightened one, a vision that seemed to transcend the boundaries of mere mortal thought, even as it expanded them. In order to speak to one of the facets of a truly capitalist society, to honor private property (its keystone), whilst flaunting disdain for monopolistic “intellectual property” and the destructive statutory jungle it has spawned, the artist incorporates uncredited imagery, appropriated from the internet.",1559351907.0

> ""This random party doesn't support climate change and are pro-oil, they're not really socdem because of that"".

In a proper socialist/SocDem country, where workers have large influence over policies, it may be that workers in the oil industry, and their unions, may wield their influence and do everything possible to prevent or delay action on climate change. A proper socialist or SocDem country would be no better than a capitalist country in regards to climate change.

Social Democracy as an ideology does not require you to believe in abortions, or require you to be progressive on abortion issues. SocDems may also be against any and all immigration. They may even be against gun control. Opinions on these issues vary widely among all social democrats.

Marxists tend to argue that because capital goods are produced via labor (if traced all the way back) that all value comes from labor. Do you disagree/agree with this view and why?,Liberal,7,s0uk6x,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/s0uk6x/marxists_tend_to_argue_that_because_capital_goods/,7,"  

I have a very hard time buying the idea that capital doesn't contribute surplus value. We can argue about ownership of capital generating value all the live long day (that is why i am a market socialist).

   
 

But that's a different discussion of whether or not capital itself generates value.

First, let's get the definition out of the way:

LTV - Labor Theory of value - the belief that all value comes from the SOCIALLY NECESSARY time to produce a commodity (so working less hard doesn't generate more value).

   
 

Alright, so the basic source of the argument I am getting comes from here: [https://www.massline.org/PolitEcon/ScottH/Keen\_LTV.htm](https://www.massline.org/PolitEcon/ScottH/Keen_LTV.htm), specifically:

Second, Keen says that the rejection of Marx’s LTV means that capitalism is not exploiting the working class after all. This is an utterly ridiculous conclusion. It is true that direct labor is not the only source of surplus; some of it does come from the machinery, the ""capital"", that the capitalist provides. But where did the capitalist get that capital, those machines and so forth? From the earlier exploitation of workers!

Basically, this guy is conceding that a machine may produce a surplus. What he is saying is that the machine itself was produced by a combination of labor and capital and that capital was produced by another combination and so on and so on and so on until you get to just labor. And so, labor is the source of the machine which means it is the source of capital which means it is the ultimate source of the value created by capital and so a more general form of the LTV holds.

   
 

Fine and dandy.

   
 

It's possible to find examples where a certain input is required for a greater output. Let's take a look at electronics for example.

I'm a computer science student so this example is near and dear to my heart:A transistor can act as a switch or a current amplifier. In order for current to flow, a transistor must have an applied voltage. This voltage allows for a larger current to flow. This is basically how a microphone/speaker setup works (i'm massively oversimplifying but still). In order for the larger current to flow, a smaller current must be applied to what's called the Gate Pin.

A similar concept is found in chemistry.

In order for a chemical reaction to happen, a certain activation energy must be reached. This may then allow for a chemical reaction to take place. Certain reactions have very high activation energies, which means they are less frequent.

   
 

Anyways, we can apply a similar logic between labor and capital. Labor is the small current, or the bump in energy need to reach activation energy, and the inherent useful value created by capital is the larger current or release of energy of the reaction.

You need labor/the smaller current for that to happen and it wouldn't happen without it, but that doesn't mean that all of the current is because of the transistor. It just allowed a larger current to flow.

Now, of course, just because this could be the case doesn't mean that it is.

The article I linked argues that this surplus comes from reusing old labor.

Perhaps that is true for some goods but it seems to be begging the question that labor is the source of that value no?

If you are going to show that labor is the source of all value you must show that the process I described isn't happening, i.e. it must be shown that value cannot come from any other source than labor.

In the case of our transistor, that larger current isn't created by the smaller one, but it does need the smaller one to happen.

Ultimately, there is no real reason to limit the value of a capital good to the value of the labor that went into it in the past. Yes, capital is past labor, but that past labor is not the limit of its value. There's no real reason to think that is unless you start with the proposition that labor is the source of all value, at which point you're begging the question

This is really the best response I have to this as of know, I haven't really seen a capitalist or hell even just Non-LTV person respond to the idea that all capital is just old labor. I'd love to read some responses to it. Of course, i could also be wrong and perhaps there is a reason other than starting with the premise we should believe that the limit of a capital good's value is its labor. I would love to read that idea as well.",1641848769.0

FairFight.com

Dear Ms Abrams,

First, let me say how much I admire your work. FairFight has accomplished so much for all of us. As a voting rights activist since 1987, I understand that protecting our right to vote requires constant vigilance and action.

""Voter suppression"" summarizes everything we are against in a snappy, two-word phrase that everybody understands at once. But we need an equally pithy way to describe what we are FOR - a motto, a rallying cry, something that will fit on a sign.

I suggest ""voter encouragement.""

As a social worker, one of my first jobs at the Center for Independent Living of North Florida was to work with our local Supervisors of Elections to train the volunteers to understand that voting rights for persons with disabilities requires flexibility and good faith, as well as ballots in braille, cards for communicating with deaf people, ramps and wide doorways and so on. So many people with disabilities had been discouraged from voting, especially by well-meaning people who's only solution to every problem was ""Use a mail-in ballot!"". 

What is voter encouragement? Ten days of ten-hour early voting. Transportation to the polls. Ballots in the necessary languages. Voter registration at the DMV. Strict enforcement of the laws banning voter intimidation in all forms, from anonymous threatening phone calls to crowds of angry people blocking the polls. You know the methods of voter encouragement better than I do.

We could say that we're for ""Voter Participation"" or ""Universal Voting"", but to my ears those phrases sound dull and lifeless. ""Voter Encouragement"" is upbeat and lively. Words matter, and powerful words matter most.

Thank you for all you have done, and for taking the time to read this.

"Delving into the ""uncool"" side of BDSM, and how to stop wanting it",Liberal,7,7qrien,RadicalFeminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/RadicalFeminism/comments/7qrien/delving_into_the_uncool_side_of_bdsm_and_how_to/,1,"Hello everyone, I'm a psychologist and I have been studying since 2010 about psychopathology, and the relevance of childhood experiences in adulthood. But this post will be both a confession and a bit of a case study.   
I wasn't born in the US, I was born in South America, and there hate crimes against women are 10 fold worse than it is in southern US. Rapes and violence against women happen every minute. To add to this already not so nice social atmosphere, I can only describe my childhood as having lived and survived relentless torture, psychological, physical and for a brief period sexual torture. Systematic, daily and for no reason, except partially because I was born female.   
I grew up sorta uninterested in relationships this life had made me standoffish and aloof, also I'd wear modest clothes with no cleavage, and loose, the sexual assault made me disgusted of my own body and I didn't want anyone to look at my ""form"" the thought of someone wanting my body was terrifying to me. 
Fast forward to the time I was exploring online porn, after my 20s, I'd end up looking at quite kinky stuff, BDSM, degrading scenes, with punishment and such. Why was I attracted to this kind of thing? To be frank I rather had ignored it for a while, but guilt and the feeling I deserved to be treated like sh*t was the core reason for it. And the feeling women needed to be submissive to men. After watching it I felt disgusted and sad.  
It was just not a healthy thing, so in order to stop this ""preference"" my mind seem to have & my sense of justice disagreed with, I went on watch a couple of these things, this time, I placed myself in these women shoes, I thought of ""what if my partner actually did this to me?"", What if it was a stranger, what are these ""actresses"" really feeling. >>Were they abused too?? Do they just need the money desperately.   
I can promise you that will ruin basically any porn for almost anyone, because it did for me, also realizing I was just re-experiencing all the traumas from my awful childhood. I did not hate or blame myself for having liked it. In a way finding that I had an attraction to it made me understand myself better and getting rid of that attraction together with realizing what it represented was truly amazing. 

I'm no longer a kinky person, I no longer want h porn, not because I am denying myself a pleasure, rather than there's no pleasure to get from it. Today I enjoy my sessions of cuddly sex with my partner and it's more and better than any kinky act could ever give me. Sometimes we just cuddle and fall asleep in each other's arms. It is so sweet and nurturing & there's no moral hangover or guilt after, only joy.

TLDR REFLECTIONS: maybe BDSM is not as liberating for some as they try to paint it as, be watchful of what that makes you feel after you're no longer horny. Why does that position of helplessness and submission (or domination) attracts you so much & what can you learn about your own emotional and psychological universe through sexual preferences (or paraphilias). What does it tell you about how you see yourself and what position you put yourself in, in the dynamic of a sexual exchange?   
   
I hope this has sparkled a sense of curiosity in some of you and please know that you don't need to be ashamed. But every now and then ask yourself if what you are doing, is building you up or tearing you down. I wish I have shed some light into the non pretty side of why some people like BDSM, I cannot answer FOR anyone why they do, but I hope I have made the right questions so that they can find, if there's any of you here.

Recent Research on the economic impacts of Co-Determination,Liberal,4,sabx5t,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sabx5t/recent_research_on_the_economic_impacts_of/,10,"**Study 1 (2020), from the Quarterly Journal of Economics:**
https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/136/2/669/5944124

_Conclusion of the study:_

_""We find no effects of board-level codetermination on wages and the wage structure, even in firms with particularly flexible wages. The degree of rent sharing and the labor share are also unaffected. We reject that disinvestment could have offset wage effects through the canonical hold-up channel, as shared governance, if anything, increases capital formation.""_


**Study 2 (2021) by the Bureau of Economic Research:**
http://economics.mit.edu/files/21562

Conclusions:

""The available evidence paints a picture of codetermination as an institution that grants workers some limited control, mostly over their immediate working conditions—providing a natural explanation of the institution’s limited empirical effects on major economic outcomes like wages or investment. This ""limited power"" explanation also accommodates the possibility that stronger codetermination arrangements, such as the more powerful works councils in Germany, possibly have larger impacts, as discussed in Sections 2 and 3.""

_""The limited impacts of European codetermination may reflect an inherent lack of power conveyed by existing arrangements, or the presence of institutional surrogates; future research could shed light on which of these potential explanations is most important in practice. Below, we discuss what these explanations might imply for the prospects of recent codetermination proposals in the United States.""

_Summary Conclusion:_

_""The evidence indicates that the European model of codetermination is neither a panacea for all the problems faced by 21st-century workers, nor a destructive institution that appears obviously inferior to shareholder control. Rather, it is a moderate institution with nonexistent or small positive net effects. Board-level and shop-floor worker representation cause at most small increases in wages, possibly lead to slight increases in job security and satisfaction, and have largely zero or small positive effects on firm performance. These limited effects may reflect limited power conveyed by existing codetermination arrangements, cultures of informal worker-management cooperation, or the influence of other pro-worker institutions""_",1642885004.0

The conclusion and idolization of Trump/some-other seem to be a priority over anything resembling critical thought. The left seems to be generally much better in this regard, more willing to criticize even the politicians they like, it seems to me.

But then there are some actual ""tankie"" types. Maybe not as common in the USA, but other places aren't that lucky. I see a significant analogy with ""trumpism,"" except it's a bit like a cult of identity still hoping for an idol to appear, when not idolizing people such as Stalin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, Fidel Castro, and so forth (while not having lived themselves during stalinism or in any present-day/recent socialist country, although maybe having had a tourist trip in Cuba). 

Anything bad on the news, human-rights NGOs, or books about such countries/regimes, is dismissed as propaganda, while also defending blatant non-deniable propaganda from these countries. If that were from people who actually live there, it would at least be minimally understandable, it's like a brainwashing, with all the censorship, and people risking their lives to bring people from these countries prohibited information. But ""tankies"" (and Trumpists/politician-cultists) do not live under such censorship, and yet they'll deny anything they don't like as ""fake news"" and stick to their OAN/Fox-news equivalents, who somehow exist without the same kind of advertising revenue (I wonder if they have some funding of such countries in some cases). It also seems to me they must have some kinds of ""Prager-U"" analogs, teaching sites with very simplistic arguments, where some rudiment of truth is coated with several layers of distortions and propaganda.

Sometimes I sort of have this conspiracy-theory kind of feeling that they're really fakes/bogus accounts (I never knew one in ""real life"") who do that to keep some justification for a ""red-scare."" Ironically their defenses/denials of socialist dictatorships are quite similar to that of right-wingers to right-wing dictatorships, which is also a thing outside the US, to some degree.

But I guess most probably seriously believe it.

So I wonder what helps them getting some better sense of things. Lines of argument and this sort of thing. If that makes any sense, I'm really tired these days. I guess it's a bit similar not only to Trumpism/other-cultism, but also to being a flat-earther or something. On the ""you're not so smart"" podcast, I recall advice from people who thought they had achieved some success on helping flat-earthers by, roughly speaking, being respectful, vs snob. But there were probably more specifics that I don't recall. At the same time, maybe even the flat-earther analogy is itself questionable when we're thinking of respect, most of them are not flat-earthers and would see this analogy as insulting.

How to fix capitalism's problems with a just a single tax,Liberal,73,qu9ngp,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qu9ngp/how_to_fix_capitalisms_problems_with_a_just_a/,49,"One of the biggest problems we face today is in regards to housing affordability.

To understand why, you need to look at price elasticity which falls into two categories: supply elasticity and demand elasticity. Demand elasticity has to do with how quickly demand will change in regards to price. For example, healthcare has an inelastic demand, much moreso than leisure. However, in a competitive market, that doesn't really matter. The problem comes when such a market is captured by one or a handful of providers. This can easily occur in a market with an inelastic supply because new providers can't easily provide more of that good. This is particularly the case with land which is about as close to inelastic on both sides as it gets. We need land to live and work on but land is a fixed good. Furthermore, not just any land will do because land in the middle of Alaska isn't as well desired as land in Manhattan or San Francisco.

There are three factors of production.

Labor: Effort by man to make or do something

Land: Anything natural such as natural resources or land itself

Capital: Anything made by man

Now the issue I take with this setup is that natural resources have more in common with capital than with land itself. Natural resources can't be made but they can be discovered. Even if it's non renewable, we can keep on discovering new reserves (that's why peak oil never happened). Furthermore, resources can be used more efficiently.

Land: Anything in fixed supply in which value can only be added through speculation. Examples include land, intellectual property, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and even geostationary orbits.

Capital: Everything else, mainly that which can be created through investment.

In the late 19th century, a man by the name of Henry George wrote a book called *Progress and Poverty*. In it, he sought to answer a question. The industrial revolution had given the US and UK so much wealth. Why then was there still poverty? Henry George's answer was that the ownership of land was the main culprit. His reasoning was that people (mainly those of affluence) were buying up land and gaining leverage over others. All of that investment in land left less left over for labor and capital. It wasn't just an affront to economic equality but also efficiency because land speculation hoards land from being used.

Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).

Henry George pointed out just how people can profit from land speculation without contributing to society.

>Take now... some hard-headed business man, who has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: ""Here is a little village; in ten years it will be a great city—in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle; it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor. Will in ten years, interest be any higher?"" He will tell you, ""No!"" ""Will the wages of the common labor be any higher...?"" He will tell you, ""No the wages of common labor will not be any higher..."" ""What, then, will be higher?"" ""Rent, the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold possession."" And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the *lazzaroni* of Naples or the *leperos* of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon or down a hole in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota of wealth to the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city you may have a luxurious mansion, but among its public buildings will be an almshouse.

To fix this, George proposed a land value tax. It's similar to a property tax except it doesn't tax the whole property, just the land on which it sits. This would deter land speculation and incentivize land owners to use the land as efficiently as possible. It also wouldn't penalize upgrading property because it would only affect land. A whole movement started around it called the single tax movement. This movement competed with socialism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But for whatever reason, georgism died out. It's now seeing a slow revival in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which was caused by land speculation. Georgism saw sympathy from people like Albert Einstein, FDR, Hellen Keller, and Winston Churchill. Convincing people that this will be a good idea will most certainly be an uphill battle but enough people are talking about it, it can start a new conversation because we can't achieve the LVT if nobody's heard of it.

And the concept predates George. Thomas Paine in *Agrarian Justice* believed in implementing an LVT in addition to an inheritance tax of 10%. 2/3 of the revenue would go to people over 50 (life expectancy back then) with the remaining third in the form of a basic income.

Adam Smith was likewise very critical of land rent (that's where the phrase ""rent-seeking"" comes from).

We generally think of economic efficiency and equality as being at odds with one another but the LVT promises to bring us a great deal of both. Social democracy is a compromise between the forces of capital and labor. Compromise generally entails that both sides are giving up something to appease the other.

Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism and Liberalism,Liberal,77,s5hzx1,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/s5hzx1/social_democracydemocratic_socialism_and/,26,"Hello fellow comrades and colleagues,

I had an interesting thought lately. A friend of mine recommended to me to more often read or even subscribe to *The Economist*. I bought a few issues of it and its articles on political matters were interesting (usually I read left-liberal papers like the *New York Times)*. As you might already know it is a wide ranging weekly newspaper with a focus on the political and financial world. While thinking about subscribing I read the Wikipedia entry on it and found something strange - their editorial line. Generally speaking they see themselves as **radically centrist** as well as liberal in their stance - a bit to the left in social matters, but in economic matters a bit more to the right (depending on who writes an article and the time).

This line ""radically centrist"" made me think ... and reflect. After some hours of forming a question I found one: **what is the connection of (predominantely) Classic European Liberalism with Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism?**

To answer this question, I'll explain the origins and connections of said ideologies. While knowing that I'll probably walk on thin ice here, I'd like for you to read it in its entirety and bring up criticism in an ordinary and respectable manner.

&#x200B;

**Back to the roots**

Usually, one of the classic punch lines against Social Democrats or Democratic Socialists is that they would not be liberal because of \[*insert random policy*\] or \[*insert random quote*\]. A thing that is happening more and more often in Europe and the Americas but nothing that would be new. Such ""assaults"" are as old as the workers movement itself.

It started with the liberal chain of revolutions in 1848. In said year, almost every country in Europe faced a revolution of at least moderate size. In some countries more successful (France), in others it failed or only achieved partial successes (Austria, Prussia). Their demands of more liberties and participation wasn't necessarily new, but in most of these countries it was despised - as it reminded too much of the French Revolution of 1789 which threw Europe into chaos.

The (classic) liberals of that time weren't new either - but were more popular than before. They were the opposition to the aristocratic or elitist conservatism/monarchism, with some monarchs siding with liberals in part. The introduction of parliaments gave said liberal groups more voice - and faced them with a dilemma. Most liberals were some lower, but mostly middle to higher class bourgeois citizens with some form of secured money source, living primarily in cities. They would stand in contrast to the masses of workers, farmers and day labourers concentrated in cities and the countryside. Only a few of those bourgeois liberals had a realistic view of the situation of the lower classes (mostly doctors and physicians) while the majority cared only for their own interests and only in part that the liberties they sought would be for everyone.

This dilemma - society vs. economy - would define liberals and its parties in the time of rapid industrialisation across great parts of Europe. Said dilemma led to a spark that originated in Germany. Ferdinand Lasalle, the founder of the ADAV (*Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein* \-  Universal German Workers Union, first SocDem party) originated from a bourgeois family and grew up in a liberal family. But reading Marx and Engels as well as his personal commitments showed him that the liberal parties don't fight enough for the masses of workers and farmers as well as those groups being enfringed by the top. So he turned to Socialism - as did more and more future leading Social Democrats. They were all disappointed by the lack of care by the liberals and their failures.

The dilemma would strike again - in the form of division. Again in Germany, the *Fortschrittspartei* (Progressive Party, a constitutional liberal party), the biggest liberal party in the German Parliaments, would split over a law regarding the indemnity for the state budget between 1861 and 1866 in Prussia. A lot of liberal voted with Bismarck which divided the party over time - leaving the more centrist/bit left-leaning Fortschrittspartei and the economy and nationally-orientated *Nationalliberale Partei* (National Liberal Party), founded in 1867.

While Germany wasn't the only nation with such a divinde within its liberals, it serves as a classic example. The *Fortschrittspartei* (which transformed into various parties in the Kaiserreich) was in opposition to Bismarck while the *Nationalliberalen* were in coalition with Bismarck and his conservatives for most of the time until 1918. This divide inside liberal parties exists worldwide to this day with most adhereing to at least one side - either left-liberal (aka social liberal) or right-liberal (aka national liberal or primarily economic liberal). Only in a few instances there would be united parties.

&#x200B;

**Rise of Social Democracy**

As mentioned before, a lot of disillusioned lower class bourgeios citizens, seeing the devastations and troubles of industrialisation, broke with Liberalism as an ideology and went to Socialism - mostly in form of Social Democracy. Alongside the workers they had one great goal that was best summed up by Axel Honneth in his book ""*Die Idee des Sozialismus*"" - the goal of social liberty for everyone. This might sound odd, but makes sense from the viewpoint of the time. Social Democracy, while being based out of Socialist principles, introduced a lot of liberal values and ideas into its movement from the start. Its leaders, partially coming from liberal parties, took their ideas with them - and enlarged their scale for a greater ammount of peoples. Essentially they mixed the ideas of Socialism and Liberalism, but applying for most if not all people. This divide inside liberal parties exists to this day with most adhereing to at least one side - either left-liberal (aka social liberal) or right-liberal (aka national liberal or primarily economic liberal).

This triggered a sort of either misunderstanding or cheap talking point by the liberal parties - saying that the goal of Social Democracy was the revolution of the proletariat. Which was correct for a long time as Marxist doctrine held firm in the party. Until a certain German entered the upper ranks of the workers movement to change it ... and create the biggest divide inside the movement itself.

&#x200B;

**Enter Eduard Bernstein**

Some of you might know my response to a fellow colleage of mine in regard to Bernstein ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/oph642/a\_response\_to\_the\_post\_eduard\_bernstein\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/oph642/a_response_to_the_post_eduard_bernstein_on/)) in which I dealt with the ideas behind this. In short: Karl Kautsky, more or less chief ideologue of the SPD and regarded as the successor of Marx, stayed true to Marxist Socialist principles with revolution if necessary at its head.

Bernstein on the other hand went the other route. Bernstein sought to fulfill Socialism and its goals via reform, entering the democratic system and achieving its goals over time rather than with a violent uprising. In this he wanted to both avoid a uncontrollable dictatorship and achieve a better democratic basis for change. The debate was hotly contested inside the SPD and even in most European SocDem parties at the time - but both wings, revolutionaries and reformists held together in their united parties, squabbling over time. And surprisingly - this brought a lot of success for most parties. With their forefront organisations (especially unions) they established themselves firmly in their nations and achieved first successes like voting rights for all citizens and lowered weekly work time.

But ... the split inside the party continued and came like the liberal one to a great divide. Which came with the First World War. Again in short: the divide between Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists and Communists.

&#x200B;

**Since 1918**

The mentioned split in the workers movement was unable to be repaired up to this day. The essential differences, like between Social Democrats and Liberals, were too great in dogmatic and ideologic matters. But, the interwar period showed the first cooperations with Liberals and Social Democrats. Most known are the Weimar Republic with the Weimar Government (SPD, DDP \[left-liberal\] and Zentrum \[catholics\]). The various United Front governments against fascism (France, Spain). But the deluges too ... liberals siding with radical nationalist elements (Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain).

Liberals were only a small part in the interwar period, which was mostly dominated by the fight nationalism/fascism vs. socialism. Again the divide would stick and both liberal spectrums would side with their ideolgically closer partners in some cases. Others would resist.

World War II brought back Liberalism and its ideas in a modern fashion. Dominated in mind mostly by classic Liberalism most parties would orientate themselves with other parties in coalitions or create party-internal wings. A well known example of different views would be the FDP, the successor party of the German Liberals. While in the beginning mostly right-liberal and in coalition with the CDU/CSU, they shifted in the late 1960s towards a more left-liberal leaning under Walter Scheel. This would lead to the 13 years of SPD-FDP governments under Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt. The *Freiburger Thesen* (Theses of Freiburg) became the left-leaning party platform that a lot of FDP members adhered to - until 1982 and their sudden shift to hardcore economic liberalism once again. One example of the left-liberals in the FDP was Gerhart Baum, a champoin for social issues and personal rights.

&#x200B;

**Connections**

Some still argue that Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism can't be liberal because of their radical socialist foundation and goals. Theoretically yes, but they often forget who those goals would benefit. While a lot of liberal parties are known as bourgeois parties (for a good reason, as most interests and members are bourgeois), Social Democracy attracted a greater following from almost all levels of society. Walking a special line: a mix of Socialist and Liberal ideas in mind - thinking themselves and acting as the ""greater"" champions of liberties and rights for all.

The goals of Liberals being in general more personal rights, securing said liberties and preserving democracy. Adding to this came the different wings - either improved social spending/social programs on the left or more economic liberty on the right. The downfall of Kenyesianism and the rise of what is today known as Neoliberalism partially changed this balance. Social liberal parties diminished in part or united with Social Democrats while economic liberals became stronger with the shift in economic thinking. Even the social liberals often embraced neolib ideas as did some Social Democrats (Blair, Schröder, Klima).

Looking at the history and basis of both ideologies it is easy to see that Social Democracy/Democratic Socialism is in some way influenced by Liberalism - but not in the way Liberals would like to see or acknowledge.

While Liberals mostly care for the preservation and extension of personal rights and liberties in general, Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists try to achieve these things for the masses by introducing more egalitarian policies and supports for lower classes.

While Liberals mostly care for Liberalism in a manner of Negative Liberties (freedom from interference by other people/the state), Social Democrats/Democratic Socialists care for Negative as well as Positive Liberties (the possession of the capacity to act upon one's free will, or in Axel Honneths way ""social liberty""), trying to connect those two as best they can.

How Social Democracy/Democractic Socialism achieves these things is seen by Liberals as not liberal, because higher taxes etc. would impede their own view of ""being free from"", putting themselves in a small light. The way of great reform is in their view the wrong way as again it would impede on the Negative Liberties of all.

Theoretically they may be right, but are in truth wrong. One example is Vienna in the interwar period. Hugo Breitner, Social Democractic city councillor for finances, introduced the, by his critics after him named, *Breitnersteuern* (in easy being taxes on luxury products and services) as well as *Wohnbausteuern* (Housing taxes - a progressive tax on housing, mostly targeting the rich and financing the new Social Housing Projects known as *Gemeindebau*). While they impeded the Liberties of a minority through taxes, they accomplished Liberties for a greater group. Even the rich classes in Vienna saw what was done with their taxes and most accepted it.

Of course I ain't the one to say ""Eat the rich"" in a radical manner, but the example shows that Liberals often enough are stuck in their own bubble and agenda, not necessarily connecting with the greater masses or interests. Some seem to achieve this (Canadian Liberals), while others run on campaigns that are strange and partially misleading (FDP in 2021 for instance).

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

While the divides between Liberals and Socialists still exist, I would argue that Social Democracy in itself is a fusion of Liberal basic ideas (meaning Classic Liberal ideas, not necessarily radical Neolib ones) combined with Socialist basics and a greater outlook, with a goal of either achieving a fair and social society with strong positive and negative liberties for all on one side or the reformist way towards Democratic Socialism over a long time (securing said liberties too). In this I would like to break a lance for Austromarxism. While in theory it was radically Socialist/Marxist in its goals (achieving the majority to start a social revolution via the democratic route), it could be considered as one of the most radical liberal ideas ever thought of. Achieving social liberty for all via the democratic route, protecting and enhancing the rights of all.

A strange coincidence? I don't think so. Liberalism is more than the ideology of the Liberal parties (or those calling themselves Liberals), but the basic idea of it (being equal rights and liberties for all) is a foundation for the movement we adhere to - for which we work day and night - for **Liberty**, Justice, Solidarity for all, not the few!

There might have been a time, some centuries ago, when individuals played a larger role than they do now, but we can say with certainty that we live in the era of institutions, and for now this seems unlikely to change. 

Progressives are often better at policy and slogans than they are at the creation of institutions. This is especially true now, when the younger generation of progressives is gaining traction on Twitter and YouTube, mostly by creating good slogans and advocating for popular policies. To a limited extent, the most popular people on these platforms can act as some of the great progressive newspaper pundits did 100 years ago. However, influence on Twitter and YouTube is fleeting. The great progressive pundits of the early and mid 1900s had the comfort of 50 year careers, by contrast, nowadays a few bad tweets might cost someone half of their followers. The point is, it is difficult to build reliable movements when the leaders of those movements are standing on quicksand. Someone with a million subscribers on YouTube still lacks the solid backing as a pundit working at one of the great newspapers of the 1950s. 

It is necessary that we have strong institutions to support individuals, because individuals, by themselves, lack the power to bring about real change. More details here:

Defensive Wars in an Ancap Society,Conservative,1,37uytc,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/37uytc/defensive_wars_in_an_ancap_society/,5,"Assume the US decides today to privatize all functions of government, and Canada decides tomorrow to invade the US, forcing all the Canadian citizens into conscription and taxing them at a 93% rate.

On the question of how the anarchist society would defend itself against the Canadians, several issues come to mind:

1. Coordination problems. There may be thousands or tens-of-thousands of private defense corporations, but these firms get paid by their customers to defend only their customers. How do all the defense firms band together to coordinate the war effort, especially given that one defense firm doesn't want to defend another defense firm's customers? Isn't it more efficient to force them under the command of one man, force them to share information, and etc.? Say these Canadians start attacking at Niagara Falls in order to conquer New York. Why would the Californian defense firms give a shit about the New York customers?


2. Freeloader problems. I think we can assume the defensive war effort will cost more than what I am already paying to my private law enforcement agency. If my firm increases its prices, but the next firm does not, and I don't think the Canadians have it in them to win, what is preventing me from switching firms to the cheaper one and leaching off everyone else who pays the increase fees?


3. Additionally, it's commonly stated among ancaps that nuclear weapons would not be developed in our society as no profit monger could justify the expense, of which only a State war monger could because of revenues from taxation at the point of a gun. However, what about Canada? They decide to invade, they have increased the tax rate of their citizens at the point of a gun, and they have developed nuclear capabilities. Don't we need at the least some Iron Dome type system to stop nuclear bombs coming from Canada? Isn't this extremely expensive - i.e., requiring a State with Force? Even when a few defense firms create iron domes, the coordination and freeloader problem arises. Why should I pay any of them when I believe other people will pay for ""my share""? And, God-forbid I mention it, wouldn't a nuclear deterrent also be useful in this situation of preventing another non-ancap nation from attacking us?


4. Bribery. Canada has a gun to the head of its citizens and is forcing them to pay a 93% tax rate, generating a substantial sum of money. What is to prevent Canada from successfully bribing the defense firms to either stay out of the fight or even join Canada? Or bribing them for information on other defense firms that they are coordinating with? With a State, the death penalty for traitors is used to prevent bribery.

Please do not answer this question with ""we need the entire world to be ancap first because then Canada wouldn't be able to use force on their citizens with a 93% tax rate to invade us"".

Please do not answer the freeloader question with ""once people live in ancap they would then voluntarily donate 93% of their money to the defense firms to protect their liberty"".

The new definition 

“Racism: The marginalization and/or oppression of people of color based on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.”

Old definition:

“Racism is the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another, that a person’s social and moral traits are predetermined by his or her inborn biological characteristics. Racial separatism is the belief, most of the time based on racism, that different races should remain segregated and apart from one another.”

> Looking at the limits of taxing and spending, Piketty concludes that “educational equality and the welfare state are not enough” and that power relationships need to be transformed, beginning with greater worker representation in the governance and wealth sharing of corporations.

Second, changes to how we do globalization and trade

> Recognizing that globalization has been an instrument for the resurgence of laissez-faire and the extremes of inequality that result, Piketty proposes a very different globalization. “We need to turn our backs on the ideology of absolute free trade,” he writes, in favor of “a model of development based on explicit and verifiable principles of economic, fiscal and environmental justice.”

third, tax funded universal income

> As a more direct strategy of wealth redistribution, Piketty calls for a “universal capital endowment” for all citizens beginning at age 25, funded by taxes on wealth and inheritances.

I recently had the chance to talk to one of my musical heroes, Nadje Noordhuis, about her experience growing up and finding her way in the music scene. We had a really wonderful conversation about her childhood, learning music, and some of the amazing teachers she had growing up, but later on she ended up sharing some very disturbing stories about her experience trying to make it in the jazz scene as a woman. I simply hadn't experienced the sort of simplistic prejudice and dismissal she had so personally in my life. I suppose I've had similar frustration with being denied basic participation in many Canadian musical communities, or grant opportunities because of being white and male, but hearing the sorts of nasty personal comments people made to her was jarring and saddening for me to hear.

On the minimum wage,Conservative,6,qkfxrf,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qkfxrf/on_the_minimum_wage/,39,"Hello all. For context, I’m a leftist (not a liberal). Not exactly a fan of unregulated capitalism as I see the entire system as greedy and exploitive. Didn’t come here to antagonize y’all though, just wanted to exchange ideas.

With that said, I’m curious as to what you all think is an acceptable minimum wage? Not a number per se, but the quality of life that it’s meant to sustain. 

When FDR first introduced this, it was meant to actually be a *livable* wage - https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/history/flsa1938. Of course this means you should be able to feed yourself and have a roof over your head at the very least without working 4 different jobs. 

It seems today that many believe that for example, the giant fast food corporations don’t need to pay workers sufficiently for their labor because it’s “not a real job” or “it’s for teens/high school students”. It seems to me that from a capitalist perspective, cutting corners when compensating your workers is just a means to maximize your profit, which is a core tenet of capitalism. (See: chattel slavery, child labor, sweatshops). I believe that if you can’t pay your employees a livable wage, *in most cases* you probably shouldn’t be in business.

This means that the ideology best poised to succeed them is... Social Democracy. Fiscal conservatism won't appeal to a nation in this type of crisis, and they've experienced the disasters of the far right and far left, and the center.

Ideologues of Decaying Capitalism

The Bankruptcy of Liberal Economists

By Joseph Seymour and Bruce André

(Part Two)

This part concludes the article, Part One of which appeared in WV No. 1125 (12 January). (Part One - https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersVanguard2/comments/7qtzfg/ideologues_of_decaying_capitalism_the_bankruptcy/?st=jd5d5vnr&sh=1e01032c)

Economist Marc Levinson in An Extraordinary Time and his more liberal counterpart Robert J. Gordon in The Rise and Fall of American Growth both address the slowdown in the U.S. growth rate since the 1970s. Levinson at least recognizes that the slowdown was rooted in a decline in investment, although he provides no explanation for that decline. Gordon provides an explanation that is more apologetic for the capitalist system and even more pessimistic regarding future prospects.

Gordon’s implicit premise is that all progressive technological innovations—in the spheres of both production and consumer goods—have been and will be transformed into new, widely marketed (that is, generally affordable) commodities, although in some cases with a lengthy time lag. To paraphrase Voltaire’s parody of the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, with regard to technological innovation Gordon views American capitalism as the best of all possible worlds. If the possibilities for growth have diminished in recent decades, it is because the intrinsic character of technological innovations has changed in a way that diminishes their effect on productivity.

The structure of Gordon’s historical study of U.S. economic growth is based on the concept of three successive industrial revolutions. The first industrial revolution (IR #1) derived from inventions developed between 1770 and 1820, primarily the steam engine and its offshoots—railroads, steamships and the shift from wood to iron and steel. The second industrial revolution (IR #2) derived from technology developed in the late 19th century, particularly electricity and the internal combustion engine. The third industrial revolution (IR #3), beginning in the 1960s, was centered on new information and communication technology (ICT), such as computers and smartphones.

According to Gordon, the root cause of the slowdown in U.S. economic growth in recent decades was the diminishing effects of the second industrial revolution and the insufficient potency of the third:

“This decline in productivity growth by almost half reflects the ebbing tide of the productivity stimulus provided by the great inventions of IR #2. Its successor, the ICT-oriented IR #3, was sufficiently potent to cause a revival in the productivity growth trend to an average of 2.05 percent during the decade 1995-2004. But the power of ICT-related innovations to boost productivity growth petered out after 2004.”

Gordon never considers the possibility that some progressive technological innovations might not be transformed into widely marketed commodities because it is not profitable to do so. Later we will address his insistence that computerization and new digital technologies in general cannot significantly increase labor productivity in the future. In fact, he maintains that these technologies have pretty much exhausted their potential.

Here we will consider Gordon’s implicit assumption that all new, widely marketed commodities were more efficient than those they replaced and improved the living standards of the populace. In particular, let’s consider the partial replacement of electrified streetcars and subway and elevated trains by the automobile, which began between 1910 and 1930. Gordon analyzes the transition from one means of personal transportation to another in some detail. However, he does not attempt to measure their comparative techno-economic efficiency. Did electrified subways and elevated trains expend greater or lesser economic resources per passenger mile than Model T Fords? And if lesser, wherein lay the advantages of the automobile?

Gordon does acknowledge that the ascendancy of the automobile was not just the result of the workings of “free market” capitalism. Government policy was a very important causal factor:

“Government policies encouraged urban sprawl and undermined the financial viability of urban transit and passenger railways. Even before World War II, public policy was skewed in favor of the automobile by building streets and highways with public funds while leaving urban transit and interurban electric railways to operate as self-sufficient private companies. Many of the early roads were built by issuing bonds on which the interest was paid by local property taxes, so the automobile owner and transit rider paid equally to build a road system that made the automobile ever more attractive than transit.”

However, Gordon offers no judgment on whether government policies that favored automobile travel at the expense of public mass transit were economically rational and socially beneficial. Nor does he address why state and local governments pursued auto-friendly policies. The answer, of course, is primarily rooted in the capitalist drive for profits: The bourgeois politicians involved were beholden to the owners of the big car companies, like Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors, and also the rubber and oil companies that provided tires and gasoline.

Class Struggle and a Shorter Workweek

Gordon states: “This book is about not just the standard of living from the viewpoint of the consumer, but also the quality of working conditions both outside and inside the home.” In keeping with his main theme, that the American people experienced a qualitative improvement in everyday conditions of life during the first half of the 20th century, Gordon cites the reduction in the average workweek from 60 hours at the turn of the century to 41 hours by 1950. But his liberal worldview blinds him to both the fundamental cause of that important change in the lives of working people and the inherent limitation of its impact on their quality of life.

According to Gordon, the decrease in the average workweek resulted from an interest shared by business owners and their workers in having a rested and healthy workforce:

“Interpretations of the movement for shorter hours center on the widespread belief on the part of both firms and labor leaders that a reduction in hours would improve work performance and increase production. Higher productivity and higher real wages made possible a gradual reduction of hours of work, for the onerous demands of sixty- and seventy-two-hour work weeks had created an exhausted male working class.”

To back up his view, Gordon cites legislation passed during the Progressive Era in the early 20th century and the New Deal in the 1930s.

In fact, the 40-hour workweek was won through decades of hard-fought and often bloody class battles by the workers movement. Agitation by the nascent industrial working class for the eight-hour day and for unions led to the Great Rail Strike of 1877, which was brutally suppressed by the Army. In the 1886 Haymarket massacre, Chicago police attacked workers rallying for the eight-hour day and arrested eight anarchist labor organizers who were subsequently framed up and imprisoned or executed. In the 1937 “Little Steel” strike, whose demands included a 40-hour week, police killed ten workers near the gates of Republic Steel in South Chicago in what became known as the “Memorial Day Massacre.”

Today, after decades of one-sided class warfare by the bourgeoisie and givebacks by the hidebound trade-union bureaucracy, the 40-hour workweek has been substantially eroded. The average workweek for full-time U.S. workers has risen to about 47 hours, nearly a full extra eight-hour day per week. About one in five full-time workers toil 60 or more hours a week, while millions are unemployed or forced to work part-time.

Workers need to fight for a shorter workweek with no loss in pay, linking the fight for decent working conditions to the struggle for jobs for all. A 30-hour workweek at 40 hours’ pay, with the available work divided among everyone, would go a long way toward addressing both unemployment and the serious safety problems resulting from fatigue and understaffing.

The capitalists would, of course, reply that such demands are not practical—at least, not if they are to maintain their obscene wealth. Indeed, the felt needs of the working class run right up against the inability of the capitalist system to satisfy them. The solution will not be found in the struggle, however necessary, by workers for a slightly bigger share of society’s wealth against a capitalist ruling class determined to maximize its profits. The goal must be a wholly different type of society, a workers America where the productive wealth has been ripped out of the hands of the tiny capitalist elite and put at the disposal of the vast majority. Such a society can be achieved only when the working class, led by a revolutionary party, overthrows capitalist class rule through a socialist revolution and establishes a workers government.

Like the class battles that won the 40-hour week, the steady erosion of this historic gain for labor since the late 1970s is for Gordon a closed book. Yet even if we accept his focus on the first half of the 20th century, when the workweek was reduced from 60 to 40 hours, this gain actually constituted something less than a qualitative change in the lives of American working people. While deploring growing income inequality in the U.S. in recent decades, Gordon does not address or even recognize a more fundamental inequality in all capitalist societies in all times: between the vast majority who have to perform what Marx called “alienated labor” to secure the means of subsistence for themselves and their families and the privileged few who can engage in creative, satisfying work.

In the preface to The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Gordon recounts that his interest in the changing rates of economic growth and labor productivity over the course of U.S. history goes back to his days as a graduate student in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid 1960s. The research for this book was undertaken to satisfy his intellectual curiosity, not because he had to do so to earn a living. But very few people have the luxury of working to satisfy their intellectual curiosity or express their creative impulses.

Consider, for example, the employees of Princeton University Press, who transformed Gordon’s manuscript into the printed pages of a book. True, they use technology that is radically different from that used by their predecessors in the 1920s, who set type for books by prominent academic economists of the time like Irving Fisher and Wesley C. Mitchell. And they work in more comfortable facilities. Nonetheless, they do the same kind of work for the same personal reason, to earn a livelihood.

Reading Gordon’s book, one would conclude that the 40-hour workweek and 11-plus-month work year, as in the U.S., is the highest possible level of organized society with regard to the necessary labor time expended by its members. However, in a planned socialist economy it would be possible, through a progressive, self-reinforcing increase in labor productivity, to radically reduce the total labor time necessary to produce both the means of production and articles of consumption. Within no more than a few generations, people would only be working, say, 20 hours a week and six months a year. Everyone would then have both the available time and access to material and cultural resources to acquire the scientific and technological knowledge that is now the province of a privileged elite. Projecting a future communist society, Marx wrote more than a century and a half ago:

“Free time—which is both leisure and time for higher activity—has naturally transformed its possessor into another subject; and it is then as this other subject that he enters into the immediate production process. This process is simultaneously discipline, with respect to the developing human being, and application, experimental science, material creative and self-objectifying science, with respect to the developed man, whose mind is the repository of the accumulated knowledge of society.”

—“Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy” (1857-58)

In a future communist society, there would be a vast expansion of the number of people capable of developing technological innovations on the order of Gordon’s heroes of the past, like Thomas Edison, Karl Benz (inventor of the automobile) and Guglielmo Marconi (a developer of the radio).

World War II: An Instance of State Capitalism

For Marxists, the most valuable part of Gordon’s book is his analysis of the “great leap forward” in labor productivity that occurred during the Second World War (1939-45) and carried into the first few decades of the postwar era. Gordon concludes: “World War II saved the U.S. economy from secular stagnation, and a hypothetical scenario of economic growth after 1939 that does not include the war looks dismal at best.” This was the one moment in modern American history when the expansion of productive facilities embodying new, more advanced technologies was not determined by the profit-making calculations of corporate executives and Wall Street financiers. In order to defeat its capitalist-imperialist enemies, the U.S. government—the executive agency of the American ruling class as a whole—directed and financed the unprecedented construction of industrial plant and equipment.

A standard economic history of the Second World War states:

“The period 1940 to 1944 saw a greater expansion of industrial production in the United States than any previous period.... Between 1940 and 1944 the total output of manufactured goods increased 300 per cent and that of raw materials by about 60 per cent. Investment in new plant and equipment, much of it direct investment by the government, is estimated to have increased the productive capacity of the economy by as much as 50 per cent.”

—Alan S. Milward, War, Economy and Society 1939-1945 (1977)

Government-funded factories and other productive facilities were turned over free of charge to corporate capitalists, thereby greatly increasing their profits both during and after the war. Gordon comments in this regard: “Though private capital input stagnated during 1930-45, the amount of capital input financed by the government surged ahead throughout that fifteen-year interval. Of particular interest was the creation of new plant facilities paid for by the government but operated by private firms to produce military equipment and supplies.”

Franklin D. Roosevelt and the other political directors of the U.S. imperialist state (for example, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau) were intimately familiar with the workings of industrial corporations and banks. They knew from firsthand experience that they could not depend on the normal mechanisms of the capitalist market to maximize the output of armaments in the shortest possible time. Big industrialists like Henry Ford and Henry Kaiser were therefore guaranteed profits through the cost-plus method of setting procurement prices. Their firms were paid whatever they claimed it cost them to build battleships, bombers, tanks, etc., with an additional markup for profit. Over the course of the war, the after-tax profits of industrial firms increased by 120 percent.

Far more important in its long-term economic effects was direct government financing of the construction of factories and other industrial infrastructure. Gordon emphasizes that the number of machine tools—the core component of an industrial economy—doubled from 1940 to 1945, and “almost all of these new machine tools were paid for by the government rather than by private firms.” Ford’s gigantic bomber-building plant in Willow Run, Michigan, was government-financed. Likewise were major pipelines, still in use today, conveying petroleum from the Texas oil fields to the Northeast. Moreover, the basic technology underlying what Gordon termed the “third industrial revolution,” beginning in the 1960s, also originated in the U.S. military during the Second World War. The prototype of the mainframe computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was developed by scientists and engineers, employed by the war department, at the University of Pennsylvania.

When the American capitalist-imperialist state maximized production, labor productivity and technological innovation, it was in order to bring death and destruction to other peoples. Arguably the most important scientific and technological breakthrough in the 20th century, the unleashing of nuclear energy, was used to incinerate the civilian populations of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Gordon Versus the “Techno-Optimists”

Gordon’s main foil in his book is an intellectual current he deems “techno-optimists,” who foresee new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence placing the American economy on the cusp of a wave of economic growth. Like Gordon, these techno-optimists (including Joel Mokyr, Gordon’s colleague at Northwestern University, as well as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT, among others) believe that it is technological innovation above all else that determines the course of society. The dispute involves two very different questions. One concerns the sphere of consumption in the present, the other the sphere of production in the future.

Gordon argues that the effect of the new information and communications technologies on the quality of everyday life has been relatively meager compared to the major innovations and inventions in the century between 1870 and 1970. Those ranged from indoor plumbing, electric lighting and central heating to automobiles, airplanes and television. Gordon writes:

“Though there has been continuous innovation since 1970, it has been less broad in its scope than before, focused on entertainment and information and communication technology (ICT), and advances in several dimensions of the standard of living related to food, clothing, appliances, housing, transportation, health, and working conditions have advanced at a slower pace than before 1970.”

At another level, the dispute between Gordon and the techno-optimists is over the “futurology” of the likelihood of dramatically transformative new technologies developing and being put into widespread use in the near future. Both sides implicitly treat capitalism as a system that best fosters technological innovation. Both, of course, write off the perspective of a collectivized planned economy as not meriting serious consideration.

In a 2014 essay titled “The Next Age of Invention: Technology’s Future Is Brighter than Pessimists Allow,” Mokyr rhapsodizes about supercomputers, 3-D printing, genetic engineering and the like. There is, however, no mention of wages, production costs, markets or profits. These basic categories determining capitalist production and investment in new technologies are likewise absent from his brief polemical response to Gordon’s recent book, “Is Our Economic Future Behind Us?” (29 November 2016). In the unlikely event that Mokyr becomes CEO of Apple or General Electric, these companies would likely face bankruptcy. If he followed his own prescriptions, Mokyr would use the most advanced and therefore most expensive equipment, irrespective of whether this elevated production costs above those of competing firms.

In his 2014 essay, Mokyr does advance an economic argument in the service of techno-optimism: “A second reason technological progress will continue unabated has to do with the emergence of a competitive global marketplace, which will encourage the spread of new technology from its originating locations to other users who do not wish to be left behind.” In fact, the extension of international trade and capital export hardly represents an unambiguous encouragement to the development of technology. In the imperialist epoch, the international economy runs up against the very nation-states upon which the imperialists base their power, constituting an obstacle to the further development of humanity’s productive forces. Production in Europe, Japan and some spots in Asia may use modern methods. However, the vast pool of cheap labor available in South and East Asia and Latin America tends to inhibit investment in laborsaving technology in both the Third World and the imperialist centers.

When U.S. and European industrial firms shift manufacturing operations to poor countries, they often tend to use less capital-intensive methods of production. Consider clothing manufacture. While the technology exists to perform this in capital-intensive, highly automated plants, it remains cheaper for companies to pay workers in oppressed neocolonies like Bangladesh pennies on the dollar to sew clothing in conditions that are closer to those of the 19th century than the 21st.

In First World countries, too, current scientific and technological knowledge is not used in a rational and socially beneficial way, and in many cases is willfully misused. Consider the field of medical research, where major efforts are made to treat baldness and erectile dysfunction while only a pittance is invested in new drugs and vaccines for potentially fatal tropical diseases.

In the U.S. alone, some 23,000 people die every year of infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A study commissioned by the British government reported that by midcentury as many as ten million people a year globally could die from drug-resistant bacteria if new treatments are not discovered. Yet despite the critical social need, most of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies long ago stopped developing new antibiotics, citing low returns on investment.

Likewise, some 25 million people in the U.S. suffer from so-called rare diseases, such as Lou Gehrig’s disease and cystic fibrosis as well as sickle cell anemia, which overwhelmingly affects black people. Yet investment in research on treatments and cures for such diseases is notoriously meager, even though rare-disease research has often uncovered fruitful pathways for treating and curing some of the most prevalent ailments. The Center for Health Journalism at the University of Southern California explained the reluctance of pharmaceutical companies: “Most say investing in treatments for rare diseases—ones that affect tens of thousands of people—does not make for good business sense.”

Disregarding the laws governing the capitalist mode of production, Mokyr, McAfee, Brynjolfsson & Co. project a quantum leap in productivity in the near future through the use of “brilliant technologies.” Gordon implicitly accepts the limitations of the capitalist system in denying the very possibility of such a development. With regard to robotics, he writes: “The exponential increase in computer speed and memory has apparently raced far ahead of the capability of robots to duplicate human movements.” Gordon offers no argument for why this gap could not be greatly reduced by future advances in scientific and technological knowledge. He makes no assessment of the resources currently expended on robotics research.

Most of the vast amount of scientific research conducted by universities is directly funded by the federal government, and the biggest chunk of federal funding is directed toward military ends. The U.S. budget last year directed $6.5 billion in R&D to the National Science Foundation, while the R&D budget of the Air Force alone totaled almost $27 billion. Research in the physical sciences, including robotics, even if at some layers of remove, tends toward the ultimate end of building better drones and other machinery to blow up things and kill people in the interests of capitalist imperialism. Mathematics funding tends toward algorithms for securing state secrets and operations while hacking into the secrets of others. The National Security Agency is widely thought to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the U.S.

At every turn, despite its thirst for technological innovation, capitalism is not the ally of scientific advance but its opponent. From intellectual property laws and the perverse incentives of the market to the tens of billions spent on more effective weaponry, capitalism directs research in the interests of the ruling class and its state apparatus. If those same resources were directed toward advancing human knowledge, furthering human happiness and putting mankind in control of its destiny, what could be accomplished is nearly unimaginable. This requires overturning the capitalist-imperialist system through a series of proletarian revolutions, laying the basis for a globally planned socialist economy. It is to lead the proletariat in that fight that the International Communist League seeks to reforge the Fourth International, world party of socialist revolution.

Well before the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union, the ""lesser evil"" imperial power to provide critical support was Imperial Germany, trying to stick it to the Entente and their colonial shit.  [Friedrich Engels himself suggested conditional support for Imperial Germany if it were attacked.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1891/letters/91_09_29.htm)

The crucial timing that needs to be emphasized is whether there's a revolutionary period for the working class or not.  If it's *not* a revolutionary period, it's OK to support ""lesser evil"" geopolitical realpolitik / campism.  If it is a revolutionary period, do *not* support ""lesser evil"" geopolitical realpolitik / campism.

Karl ""John Kerry"" Marx got it wrong.  He supported German unification under Bismarck in 1870-1871, then flipped-flopped.  It was *not* a revolutionary period for the working class.  Moreover, German victory was a key catalyst to none other than the Paris Commune.

Both August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht got it wrong.  They should have been ""social patriots"" in German unification at France's expense.  Instead, they voted against war.  It was their anti-unification antics that brought about the Anti-Socialist Laws!

On the other hand, Alexander Parvus got it woefully wrong.  He supported a German victory in WWI.  However, it *was* a revolutionary period for the working class.

Walter Reuther: The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit,Liberal,69,qr5fzb,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qr5fzb/walter_reuther_the_most_dangerous_man_in_detroit/,5,"This man is an American hero, arguably a hero to the world, and should be better known. 

Walter Reuther was born in Wheeling, West Virginia in 1907 to immigrants from Germany. He had four siblings. On Sundays his father, Valentine Reuther, would encourage the whole family to engage in vigorous debates about the social issues of the time. Walter said of his early years, ""At my father’s knee we learned the philosophy of trade unionism. We got the struggles, the hopes and the aspirations of working people every day."" At one point in his childhood, he and his brother Victor went with their father to visit Eugene V. Debs, who was at the time in prison for speaking out against American involvement in WWI. When he was younger, his family could not afford underwear, so his mother made some out of empty flour sacks.

He left home and worked in Detroit for several years, but in 1932 he was fired for campaigning for Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas. He and his brother Victor left the U.S. and toured Europe and found work in the Soviet Union. Walter regularly wrote critical letters to local Soviet newspapers complaining that the communists were poor managers. He later became ardently anti-communist, and joined the Democratic Party after being impressed by President Franklin Roosevelt.

The brothers returned to Detroit and organized sit-down strikes with the United Automobile Workers. In 1936 they unionized General Motors after a 44 day strike in Detroit and Flint, Michigan during which workers blocked police and strikebreakers from entering the GM plants. Workers across the country engaged in solidarity strikes (which are now illegal in Australia, the Netherlands, the U.S. and the U.K.). Their biggest target for unionization was Ford Motor Company, but Henry Ford was quite adamantly anti-union. In 1937 Walter Reuther was passing out fliers about unionization in Dearborn, Michigan when he was brutally beaten by Ford's private security forces, who had a record from a 1932 incident of shooting striking workers. Nevertheless, Reuther persisted and in 1941 the Ford Motor Company was unionized. 

During WWII, Reuther was instrumental in converting America's manufacturing capacity from making cars to making planes. This was the ""Reuther Plan."" In 1953 President Eisenhower wrote Reuther a letter saying, ""When I last addressed a CIO Convention, I came to thank you for your magnificent performance in World War II in supplying the planes and tanks and ships and arms. You did your job, and you did it well.""

Following WWII, the UAW continued to gain in strength, due in no small part to Reuther's leadership and willingness to organize strike actions. George Romney, father of Senator Mitt Romney, representing business interests, called Reuther ""...the most dangerous man in Detroit because no one is more skillful in bringing about the revolution without seeming to disrupt the existing forms of society."" On multiple occasions people attempted to assassinate Reuther, including once in 1948 when someone fired a shotgun at him through his window while he was eating dinner. They also tried to kill his brother Victor with a shotgun blast in 1949, when Victor had just returned to the U.S. from working with labor unions in Germany and the U.K.

In the 1960s, Walter involved himself and organized labor in the environmental movement, a variety of Civil Rights struggles, and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. He proposed the idea of a Peace Corps to JFK. He helped fund and organize for the March on Washington, the NAACP, boycotts and marches. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Walter Reuther saying, ""More than anyone else in America, you stand out as the shining symbol of democratic trade unionism... One day all of America will be proud of your achievements, and will record your work as one of the glowing epics of our heritage.""

Sadly, Walter Reuther and his wife May, along with several others, died in a plane crash in 1970. Coretta Scott King, widow of MLK, spoke at the funeral. 



I wanted to share all of this because I feel like I myself don't know as much as I ought to about the labor history of my own country. Walter Reuther was there in the thick of it at critical moments in the history of 20th century America and I've only learned about him since becoming more interested in the history of labor movements in particular. And he really ought to be remembered because he is a downright inspiring figure.

How The (Lack Of) Emotions Of Men Impacts Everyone,Liberal,5,t2595q,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/t2595q/how_the_lack_of_emotions_of_men_impacts_everyone/,1,"I get frustrated everytime I come across a guy complaining about not receiving compliments or hugs IN YEARS or even decades, if not for their loneliness, or even total deprivation and neediness of any kind of affections.

But, since I am not a guy, I feel there is not much I could do to help them out, as if I were to hug or even compliment some helpless lonely guy, he would probably take my kindness  as if I were asking him to do something in return for me or, even worst, if I were giving him consent to do whatever he wanted with me, like if I were ""giving myself into him"", all that only shows the lens from which the average guy, if not the majority of humans, understand or view affection like, selfishly, they understand and view kindness not as an end in itself, but as a MEANS to get rewarded with some kind of pleasure in return, specially sexual contact.


If you have been living under a rock for years, the internet calls ""nice guys"" the guys that are kind to women but ONLY as a means to ""white knight"" them as trophy possessions, as an ulterior second intention for their kindness to women, but they do not understand that women are people like them, while they view love as a game, usually, because of the fairytale fantasies that shape their behaviors as idealized models for romance and which they were told when growing up, fantasies in which every hero is rewarded with a beautiful young lady for their kindness and heroic actions.


Because all of that, for a long time, in many cultures within societies across time and space, if a woman or a guy were to show a guy some affection and hold his hand, people around them, specially other guys, would view that as if the person holding the hand of a guy were doing so to get from him some kind of satisfaction for themselves in return, while, very ironically, on the other hand, if a lesbian woman were to hold the hand of her lesbian lover, they would not be viewed as more than friends, because if they were assumed to be lovers, the satire subreddit r/SapphoAndHerFriend, most likely, would not need to exist.

Men being more rational is just a lame excuse for why men have a harder time dealing with their emotions, or do not deal with them at all because they cannot handle them, rejecting their feelings, what is like rejecting your purpose existing as a human in the SENSITIVE material world, as, if for anything at all, you were born to feel.

By the way, it cannot be left unsaid that if men were more rational than other genders, they would not have started literal centuries of wars against one another, or would not fill prisons.

What makes incels and many other guys threats to the living beings around them is that they are deprived of affections, usually because, in the first place, they do not know how to deal with their feelings, feelings of other beings around them (empathy), emotional connections or even feeling as a whole at all, if not, in the worst case scenario, because they also grew up deprived of all kinds of affections.

My post stated that he was stealing (felony theft, mind you) just because he didn't get what he wanted from someone else, and that he should be in prison.

The moderators there banned me, telling me that the answer shouldn't be prison, but that he should have been paid more.

You can't make this stuff up. I will take screen captures if anyone needs them for proof.

I then contested the ban because literally all I had said was that what this person was doing was criminal and that they should be in prison for it (all objectively true facts).

I was also informed that the moderators of that forum are communists.",1642899509.0

Measuring stuff with money is meaningless. Money means different values in different places, and at different times. And not all needs have the same pricing in different places, either.

Instead, we should measure poverty by *what people have*, as in the material things, rather than a monetary threshold. Tech Workers in San Francisco may make tens of thousands of dollars but can't live in a house *still have a form of poverty.*

I'm unsure of how to measure those who *could* obtain these things but *don't*, but I doubt they're common enough to matter.

What should be on this list, and what thresholds should they include?

* Housing (Pest free, secure)
* Heat & Climate Control

my friend was right. the term does make me think more. it makes me think about how insufferable my fellow liberals can be with their constantly changing language standards. i am sick to death with this game of sensitivity one-upmanship. this term accomplishes nothing. it sounds like something a person who speaks english as a second language might say. plus, it makes way less sense than homeless, linguistically. a house is a specific type of dwelling. someone living in a condo is technically ""houseless"". i will never say houseless.",1626379149.0

Help me edit this posts meant to push my friends into a more radical direction,Liberal,0,snz0j1,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/snz0j1/help_me_edit_this_posts_meant_to_push_my_friends/,1,"Hello, I'm new to this sub but definitely not the online left overall. I was working on a post to help radicalize my friends on Facebook and I need help editing/finishing it, and sourcing reasources related to the topic at the end. I started to get really burnt out towards the end and felt like it was getting unorganized and ranty, and I want to fix that and get feedback overall. 
The post is bellow is for black history month, my goal is to connect America's history of racism  to modern exploitation of Africa specifically (I have a lot of BLM supporters on my friendslist,) and show how America's elite export racism, exploitation, and most of its issues to poorer, and mostly minority countries. I don't want to mention capitalism, or socialism in the post or language like that, because that can easily put off people in the early stages of their journey toward being a leftist, or make them think I'm trying to co opt black issues for political reasons. 
I'd especially like help on how to order the things I'm saying, what should be removed vs what should be expanded upon, and good things to include in the additional reasources section.

Here's the rough draft I have so far:


If you consider yourself anti racist, and an ally to black people, or even a decent human being, and don't want to be like the same people who did nothing while slavery was happen not fighting against, or questioning it then you need to read this, educate yourself. It may seem like the majority of the battle against racism is done, or maybe you've put in your part by supporting BLM, however that can't be farther from the truth. 
Our nations wealth has been, and still is built off the exploitation of others (especially minorities), with both being the larger now than ever. The exploitation our nations wealth is built off of is like a virus, evolving and responding to every attempt to stop it. If fighting against the exploitation of others isn't enough of a call to action, then consider this quote 

""The elite, cocky and filled with greed, will sell the rope that is used to hang themselves.""

It's projected that America will soon not be the wealthiest or most poweful nation on Earth, with the reason being the greed which led our elite to chase cheaper labor and less regulation being to blame. 

With it being black history month, and I'd like to remind you that America's racism is alive stronger than ever, with things far worse than slavery happening to fuel American consumerism and wealth. Most the world, but especially Africa carries the burden for our countries wealth and our comfortable lives, its a necessity to fight against that to truly care about black lives. The BLM movement was important for fighting for the rights of black people in our country, but they are a tiny fraction of the black people oppressed by us, and far from the ones worst effected. 

In the past we shipped African slaves to America to build our own wealth and expand our influence, its a fallacy that this dynamic ever ended or even improved. Now instead America builds its wealth in Africa directly by exploiting it's workers and reasources, topling any governments that challenge them, all under the guise of spreading our wealth and ideals (neither of which are true or help Africans.) 

It may seem hopeless when learning about stuff like this, or seem pointless to the point you think learning about politics/news is a waste of time, but trust me there's hope, you just need to believe in the humanity of your fellow man. The few always will have less power than the many, my hope lies in believing that with a true understanding of what shapes our society a majority of people will think it'd wrong and be willing to fight against it. When you believe this the only barrier to change is educating the many on the true enemy, I believe no matter how much propaganda and control is used the power of the truth can overcome. 

 The elite can and have easily toppled many countries that threaten their power, however the people there still fought despite this. As citizens of America we pose the greatest threat to the elite because our privilege, they can't use a fraction of the tools they use in other countries to stop a threat to their power here. While in other countries they can use military police, assassinations of political figures, destruction of economies, and much more, their main tools they can use in America itself are already in use. For their system to continue they need us to not know the atrocities they commit, the alternatives that exist, the fact we don't need them, and most importantly the power we hold to change things. Us feeling hopeless, apathetic, using all our effort to fix symptoms, instead of the root issues, and believing them is the glue that holds this whole system together. The majority of books on propaganda you read were directed at this exact system, not some theoretical society or far off land like North Korea. 

Here are some of the best videos and articles I've found to learn more about this topic and what you can do about it:

WikiLeaks reveals DNC holds labor unions in contempt (x-post /r/Leftwinger),Liberal,2,4vski5,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/4vski5/wikileaks_reveals_dnc_holds_labor_unions_in/,0,"The latest WikiLeaks document dump — containing emails by high-ranking staffers of the Democratic National Committee — caused considerable heartburn for America’s oldest political party. But what’s just as interesting is the dog that didn’t bark — the fact that wasn’t regarded as a scandal but perhaps ought to have been.

Even casual political observers can see that labor union leadership and the Democratic Party are allied. AFL-CIO boss Richard Trumka spoke at the convention the other night, endorsing Hillary Clinton and calling the Republican nominee “wrong, wrong, wrong” for America.

Yet the emails that have been released highlight the rather one-way relationship between the Democratic Party and labor unions. DNC staffers see the unions as good soldiers in skirmishes with Republicans, as a pain when it comes to getting things done and, ultimately, as pushovers.

When brainstorming what to do about last week’s Republican National Convention, the DNC’s Rachel Palermo urged her party to “meet with the hotel trades, SEIU, and Fight for 15 about staging a strike.” She said the result could be a “fast food worker strike around the city or just at franchises around the convention.” The aim would not be to improve working conditions, but to bloody Republicans.

Alternately, the DNC could “infiltrate friendly union hotels and properties around the convention that Republicans will be patronizing to distribute ‘care’ packages” — probably not chocolates.

Palermo also noted that “SEIU has space in downtown Cleveland close to convention that can be the base of operations and host the wrapped mobile RV.”

The union-DNC alliance does impose a few constraints on the DNC, which staffers both mocked and worked to circumvent. DNC staffer Katja Greeson, for instance, complained about delays involved in getting new business cards printed.

She explained to an irked communications director that sending work to union shops caused delays. “Believe me — it is equally frustrating to us,” she said. Greeson also threatened “if they can’t deliver,” DNC staffers would “go to FedEx Kinkos” and do it themselves.

The DNC pledges to use only unionized hotels. But it turns out there’s a workaround for that, too. Trey Kovacs, who has done yeoman’s work spelunking through the DNC WikiLeaks dump, uncovered this one. In an exchange over whether they could use the non-union Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., a DNC staffer says they could just get a “waiver” to use it.

“It is unclear from the emails how or what circumstances must arise to obtain a waiver, but it seems that convenience for the chairman trumps loyalty to adhering to some kind of internal guidelines of exclusively patronizing unionized establishments,” Kovacs, a policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told me Wednesday.

Because this document dump has emails both to and from the DNC, we also hear from the unions themselves, which might explain why the party can count on their support come-what-may.

For instance, Sandra Lyon of the American Federation of Teachers asked for any “regular talking points” the DNC might have to pass on to AFT folks who speak with the media.

And the National Education Organization’s political communications director Michael Misterek wrote longingly to the DNC in May, “I’m hoping we can sit down to meet some time soon, over coffee or a cocktail. I’d love to figure out how we can work together and be most helpful to each other these next few months.”

A Call for Unity among Radical Feminists in the Fight to Amend the Equality Act,Liberal,20,k1nprk,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/k1nprk/a_call_for_unity_among_radical_feminists_in_the/,29,"**Feminists in Struggle (FIST) have posted an Open Letter from Feminists in Struggle to the Interim Steering Committee of the Women’s Human Rights Campaign USA: A Call for Unity among Radical Feminists in the Fight to Amend the Equality Act.**

FIST's Open Letter notes that the Interim Steering Committee (ISC) of the Women’s Human Rights Campaign (WHRC) recently released the “Equality for All Act,” its own version of an amended Equality Act (EA), a bill pending in Congress that would add “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” as protected sub-classes under the category of “sex” in federal discrimination laws.

--

FIST's Open Letter notes that the revision of the bill that the ISC has produced is less comprehensive and actually far less protective of the sex-based rights of women and girls than FIST’s Feminist Amendments to the Equality Act that pre-date ISC’s version by more than a year.

--

FIST believes that the approach of FIST’s Feminist Amendments is significantly more protective of sex-based rights than ISC’s draft bill for two reasons: 

  1.   the Feminist Amendments spell out that female-only spaces and programs do not constitute discrimination based on sex or sex stereotyping; and 

  1.  the Feminist Amendments make robust findings about the subordinate status of women in society, the pervasive nature of male violence, and the need for women-only spaces and programs in the interests of achieving true equality for the female sex.

Workers Vanguard No. 1096 23 September 2016

From the Archives of Marxism

“From the Kingdom of Necessity to the Kingdom of Freedom”

We publish below excerpts from Friedrich Engels’ 1880 work Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. In explaining scientific socialism, Engels makes clear that only through the conquest of power by the working class and the expropriation of the capitalist class can the benefits of science, technology and education be available to all, laying the material basis for the full liberation of humanity. The excerpts below are taken from the Marx and Engels Selected Works (Progress Publishers, 1976).

The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men’s brains, not in men’s better insight into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought not in the philosophy, but in the economics of each particular epoch. The growing perception that existing social institutions are unreasonable and unjust, that reason has become unreason and right wrong, is only proof that in the modes of production and exchange changes have silently taken place with which the social order, adapted to earlier economic conditions, is no longer in keeping. From this it also follows that the means of getting rid of the incongruities that have been brought to light must also be present, in a more or less developed condition, within the changed modes of production themselves. These means are not to be invented by deduction from fundamental principles, but are to be discovered in the stubborn facts of the existing system of production.

What is, then, the position of modern socialism in this connection?

The present structure of society—this is now pretty generally conceded—is the creation of the ruling class of today, of the bourgeoisie. The mode of production peculiar to the bourgeoisie, known, since Marx, as the capitalist mode of production, was incompatible with the feudal system, with the privileges it conferred upon individuals, entire social ranks and local corporations, as well as with the hereditary ties of subordination which constituted the framework of its social organisation. The bourgeoisie broke up the feudal system and built upon its ruins the capitalist order of society, the kingdom of free competition, of personal liberty, of the equality, before the law, of all commodity owners, of all the rest of the capitalist blessings. Thenceforward the capitalist mode of production could develop in freedom. Since steam, machinery, and the making of machines by machinery transformed the older manufacture into modern industry, the productive forces evolved under the guidance of the bourgeoisie developed with a rapidity and in degree unheard of before. But just as the older manufacture, in its time, and handicraft, becoming more developed under its influence, had come into collision with the feudal trammels of the guilds, so now modern industry, in its more complete development, comes into collision with the bounds within which the capitalistic mode of production holds it confined. The new productive forces have already outgrown the capitalistic mode of using them. And this conflict between productive forces and modes of production is not a conflict engendered in the mind of man, like that between original sin and divine justice. It exists, in fact, objectively, outside us, independently of the will and actions even of the men that have brought it on. Modern socialism is nothing but the reflex, in thought, of this conflict in fact; its ideal reflection in the minds, first, of the class directly suffering under it, the working class....

The perfecting of machinery is making human labour superfluous. If the introduction and increase of machinery means the displacement of millions of manual by a few machine-workers, improvement in machinery means the displacement of more and more of the machine-workers themselves. It means, in the last instance, the production of a number of available wage-workers in excess of the average needs of capital, the formation of a complete industrial reserve army, as I called it in 1845, available at the times when industry is working at high pressure, to be cast out upon the street when the inevitable crash comes, a constant dead weight upon the limbs of the working class in its struggle for existence with capital, a regulator for the keeping of wages down to the low level that suits the interests of capital. Thus it comes about, to quote Marx, that machinery becomes the most powerful weapon in the war of capital against the working class; that the instruments of labour constantly tear the means of subsistence out of the hands of the labourer; that the very product of the worker is turned into an instrument for his subjugation. Thus it comes about that the economising of the instruments of labour becomes at the same time, from the outset, the most reckless waste of labour power, and robbery based upon the normal conditions under which labour functions; that machinery, the most powerful instrument for shortening labour time, becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer’s time and that of his family at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital. Thus it comes about that the overwork of some becomes the preliminary condition for the idleness of others, and that modern industry, which hunts after new consumers over the whole world, forces the consumption of the masses at home down to a starvation minimum, and in doing thus destroys its own home market. “The law that always equilibrates the relative surplus population, or industrial reserve army, to the extent and energy of accumulation, this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the rock. It establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time, accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital.” (Marx’s Capital, p. 671)....

The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers—proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is rather brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution.

This solution can only consist in the practical recognition of the social nature of the modern forces of production, and therefore in the harmonising of the modes of production, appropriation, and exchange with the socialised character of the means of production. And this can only come about by society openly and directly taking possession of the productive forces which have outgrown all control except that of society as a whole. The social character of the means of production and of the products today reacts against the producers, periodically disrupts all production and exchange, acts only like a law of Nature working blindly, forcibly, destructively. But with the taking over by society of the productive forces, the social character of the means of production and of the products will be utilised by the producers with a perfect understanding of its nature, and instead of being a source of disturbance and periodical collapse, will become the most powerful lever of production itself....

Since the historical appearance of the capitalist mode of production, the appropriation by society of all the means of production has often been dreamed of, more or less vaguely, by individuals, as well as by sects, as the ideal of the future. But it could become possible, could become a historical necessity, only when the actual conditions for its realisation were there. Like every other social advance, it becomes practicable, not by men understanding that the existence of classes is in contradiction to justice, equality, etc., not by the mere willingness to abolish these classes, but by virtue of certain new economic conditions. The separation of society into an exploiting and an exploited class, a ruling and an oppressed class, was the necessary consequence of the deficient and restricted development of production in former times....

Division into classes has a certain historical justification, it has this only for a given period, only under given social conditions. It was based upon the insufficiency of production. It will be swept away by the complete development of modern productive forces. And, in fact, the abolition of classes in society presupposes a degree of historical evolution at which the existence, not simply of this or that particular ruling class, but of any ruling class at all, and, therefore, the existence of class distinction itself has become an obsolete anachronism. It presupposes, therefore, the development of production carried out to a degree at which appropriation of the means of production and of the products, and, with this, of political domination, of the monopoly of culture, and of intellectual leadership by a particular class of society, has become not only superfluous but economically, politically, intellectually, a hindrance to development.

This point is now reached. Their political and intellectual bankruptcy is scarcely any longer a secret to the bourgeoisie themselves. Their economic bankruptcy recurs regularly every ten years. In every crisis, society is suffocated beneath the weight of its own productive forces and products, which it cannot use, and stands helpless, face to face with the absurd contradiction that the producers have nothing to consume, because consumers are wanting. The expansive force of the means of production bursts the bonds that the capitalist mode of production had imposed upon them. Their deliverance from these bonds is the one precondition for an unbroken, constantly accelerated development of the productive forces, and therewith for a practically unlimited increase of production itself. Nor is this all. The socialised appropriation of the means of production does away, not only with the present artificial restrictions upon production, but also with the positive waste and devastation of productive forces and products that are at the present time the inevitable concomitants of production, and that reach their height in the crises. Further, it sets free for the community at large a mass of means of production and of products, by doing away with the senseless extravagance of the ruling classes of today and their political representatives. The possibility of securing for every member of society, by means of socialised production, an existence not only fully sufficient materially, and becoming day by day more full, but an existence guaranteeing to all the free development and exercise of their physical and mental faculties—this possibility is now for the first time here, but it is here.

With the seizing of the means of production by society, production of commodities is done away with, and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic, definite organisation. The struggle for individual existence disappears. Then for the first time man, in a certain sense, is finally marked off from the rest of the animal kingdom, and emerges from mere animal conditions of existence into really human ones. The whole sphere of the conditions of life which environ man, and which have hitherto ruled man, now comes under the dominion and control of man, who for the first time becomes the real, conscious lord of Nature, because he has now become master of his own social organisation. The laws of his own social action, hitherto standing face to face with man as laws of Nature foreign to, and dominating him, will then be used with full understanding, and so mastered by him. Man’s own social organisation, hitherto confronting him as a necessity imposed by Nature and history, now becomes the result of his own free action. The extraneous objective forces that have hitherto governed history pass under the control of man himself. Only from that time will man himself, more and more consciously, make his own history—only from that time will the social causes set in movement by him have, in the main and in a constantly growing measure, the results intended by him. It is the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom....

To accomplish this act of universal emancipation is the historical mission of the modern proletariat. To thoroughly comprehend the historical conditions and thus the very nature of this act, to impart to the now oppressed proletarian class a full knowledge of the conditions and of the meaning of the momentous act it is called upon to accomplish, this is the task of the theoretical expression of the proletarian movement, scientific socialism.

Anti-totalitarian and authoritarian regimes: All types of regimes that are either totalitarian or authoritarian will be sure that I will take the arms again them at the first opportunity.

A Rant About Liberals and the Online Left.,Liberal,19,s5jlkt,alltheleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/s5jlkt/a_rant_about_liberals_and_the_online_left/,4,"First of all, if you aren't going to read this whole thing, don’t bother commenting. I’d love to talk about this with other leftists, and to brainstorm ideas. If you are just going to comment vitriol, I’m not going to talk with you. Just hear me out, and read the whole post. I’m a baby lefty, and have only been so for about a year, so any *meaningful* discussions would be well appreciated.

So, This is a bit of a rant about an issue that I have with leftist online spaces, especially those on reddit. My issue is specifically with how we talk about and deal with liberals. Let me be clear, to preempt the comments. I do not like liberal*ism*. This is not me trying to give apologia to that ideology. Liberal ideology inevitably leads to exploitation and to imperialism. I do, however, think that now, with the clear failures of liberal capitalism being shown to the whole world, now we have a chance that is greater than ever before to offer up leftist ideology as an alternative to our current capitalist system. 

On r/ShitLiberalsSay, one of the most common posts you see is liberals talking down to conservatives. The liberals will say stuff like “republicans deserve to live in poverty because they vote red.” or elitist talking points about how republicans are all poor and uneducated. We see this kind of thing, and successfully recognize that it is not republicans fault for the conditions they live in. they have a media that manufactures their consent away from class based solutions to their problems, to focus on meaningless Culture War bullshit. We feel sympathy for them, as they kept from being able to address what would seriously help them. They are Lumpenproletariat, kept from ever opening their eyes to what would actually solve their problems. 

What I see as weird, is whenever we talk about liberals, the attitude changes. People talk about liberals like they are all Billionaires, CEOs, or politicians. But they aren't. The average liberal is just a regular person, who, like conservatives, is led to a party that represents no meaningful change. They are also victims of Red-Scare propaganda, a media that manufactures consent, and an education system that makes them out to be yes-men for a system that seeks to exploit them. But we never seem to talk about it. Whereas every conversation about conservatives is framed around how they are victims of brainwashing, conversations about liberals seem to revolve around how they will “all face the wall when the revolution comes.” (Now I should say, I have no issue with the ultra wealthy elite and politicians being punished when/if the time comes, but 99% of the population cannot be executed if we want to have a successful revolution.) This puzzles me, because I don’t see why we don't dedicate more of our energy to bringing liberals left. It seems to me like we should be dedicating much more of our energy to radicalization. Whenever I look to leftist circles, it looks like instead of trying to bring people left, we just seem to wait for people to stumble left on their own. Contrast this to the right, and even specifically the alt-right, with their radicalization rabbit-holes, and active cultivation of bringing “normies” into their grips. We make no such effort to try to get the average person to the left. And I think this is a major missed opportunity. 

Liberalism gained it’s near universal appeal by promising to bring prosperity and freedom to everybody. Obviously, it has utterly failed to bring about this, but those reasons are why people still believe in it today. This is where our chance is. The way to actually achieve these results are through socialist actions, meaning we have a real chance to get these people and bring them to our side. The average liberal, someone who ISN’T ultra wealthy, or politically powerful, wants these like we do. The difference being of course, they’ll never actually achieve it through bourgeois democracy. 

Now we have our greatest chance. The distrust and hatred of the system is everywhere. Even in mainstream places like r/politics, you can see people talking about how our politicians don’t work for us, and how our economy only favors the ultra-wealthy. This is our shot. With so many people seeing the flaws in “the system” it is our chance to identify this not as some nebulous “system” but capitalism. We have a serious chance here to radicalize people to anti-capitalism. 

To preempt some naysayers. Yes, liberals can be radicalized. Yes, they (some of them) can be reasoned with. Unless you were born a leftist, there is a good chance that you were a liberal at some point, and you managed to find your way here. You were convinced of leftism's merits, and now you want to abolish capitalism. Once again, The average liberal isn’t super rich, they don’t own billions, they are poor millennials or Gen-Xers living in cities. They voted blue, not because they know that the democratic party won’t provide any meaningful change, and won’t challenge power structures, they vote blue because they *think* it will bring about change. They think it will help improve people’s conditions. Especially with the failures of the Biden administration, we have a serious chance to rip off the blindfolds. 

Capitalism is facing it’s greatest crisis yet. And it’s one of its own making. Between climate change, economic inequality, and COVID, discontent with our capitalist way of life is at an all-time high. Now we should be exploiting this chance to radicalize people, and bring them into our movement. 

Once again, I would be really excited to discuss things with everyone, as long as it's in good faith. 

TLDR: just about everybody sees that the system isn't working, the average liberal isn't a billionaire or CEO, so with all of the crises facing capitalism, we should be out radicalizing people, not sitting down and waiting for them to radicalize themselves.",1642361885.0

In Canada (where I live), this would correspond to 33K per year. But keep in mind that someone middle class in Canada (which I would consider a very comfortable life) doesn’t keep their entire 55K. After taxes, they only take home about 43.5K. This means that someone making minimum wage (and pays no income tax) in this scenario would enjoy about 75% of the purchasing power of what someone currently middle class makes.

Rant: Why do so many people overlook or downplay mass starvation or man-made famine when they're committed by the British instead of supposed 'Socialists' like Stalin and Mao?,Liberal,15,s2bwub,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/s2bwub/rant_why_do_so_many_people_overlook_or_downplay/,5,"I constantly see people show the famines that happened in the USSR or PRC as Holocaust level genocides which decisively show why socialism is an ideology that starves innocent people, but incidents like the Irish Potato Famine or the Bengal famines of 1770 and 1940 are often swept aside as mere oopsy daisy events that had little to nothing to do with the British or their greed and neglect.

But not only did the famines in Ireland and Bengal were very similar to those caused by Stalinist mismanagement, but also the former were no less unnatural and man-made than the latter *(for example, the Great Bengal Famine of 1770 was in large part caused by the British forcing farmers to cultivate cash crops like tea and opium instead of food crops like rice.)*

Why not casinos? Im not talking about indigenous territory. Im talking about big casinos right on Times Square, Ocean Drive, Hollywood Blvd, French Quarter, and every major area in every major American city. LIVE dealers, not just some rinky-dink machines.

It may sound outrageous but this is the case in the Netherlands. Brothels are legal, cannabis is legal everywhere, casinos are found in every major city from Amsterdam, Haarlem, Dordrecht, Rotterdam, The Hague, etc...

Thoughts on Scandinavia's Luxury Prisons?,Liberal,0,qlf9hf,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qlf9hf/thoughts_on_scandinavias_luxury_prisons/,129,"Prisons in Scandanavia are nice, to say the least. In fact, they're almost luxurious. 

The Halden Prison in Norway, for instance, gives its prisoners (including murderers and rapists) flat-screen TVs, private showers and toilets, fridges, and live in considerable comfort. 

For petty nonviolent crimes like shoplifting, possession, misdemeanour, etc, it makes a lot more sense. A handful of prisoners currently languishing in American super prisons aren't bad people and don't deserve the kind of treatment they get.

 I'm in favour of major sentencing and incarceration reform for petty crime and drug charges, but turning all prisons into the Ritz Carleton is a stretch. The idea of murderers and rapists being mollycoddled while luxuriating in cushy accommodations is extremely disturbing. Some of these prison cells are literally nicer than college dorms. 

It makes me angry. Criminal justice reform is necessary, but what Scandinavia does is excessive. 

Giving the worst criminals and homicidal monsters a shoulder to cry on isn't ""humane"". It actually devalues human life in my opinion. If someone were to shoot ten people in the face, the authorities would give them a nice warm bear hug, a box of tissues and free TV instead of making them suffer in proportion to the severity of their crime. No matter how many lives you destroy, Scandinavia's prison system will ensure that you live like a king. This isn't ""humane"". It's psychotic. 

Prisoners get luxurious conditions and lots of free shit at the monetary expense of honest, hardworking, decent taxpaying citizens. While good people are out there earning their keep and paying taxes, the worst of humanity is being fattened by relative opulence. Instead of spending money pampering and coddling murderers, why not spend that money on healthcare, education, and public infrastructure? Instead of giving homicidal monsters free TVs, why not upgrade the computer facilities in schools? Instead of giving rapists nice big cushy accommodations like they're tourists, why not send foreign aid to Africa where good people are starving?

Now, I'm by no means asserting that you get into a totally risk free zone once you grow up or something & all chances of facing something unfortunate rules out but more like the risks of you being the target of the things  mentioned or the vulnerability reduce drastically.

I'm by no means saying that these threats are limited to women but my question is about women specifically so please look into it in that sense. 😊
Also, I don't mean to establish that women are in danger all the time or that the world is a terrible place yada yada  but considering the kind of place the world is today, these ""threats"" are still a major aspect of lives of most women.

So, coming back, I'm 23 now and as I've grown up, I noticed how girls who are younger are at a higher risk of being victims. And I've come to this conclusion coz I myself have been in similar situations so many times when I was younger but I feel much safer now due to reduction of instances that I was earlier facing that made me feel threatened & I believe me growing up has been a major factor in this new condition where I'm at a lower risk (nothing much changed besides my age). 

Though I feel worried for them girls around, I feel a little relieved knowing I'm not a target myself or the chances of me being the target has reduced to almost nil and I've changed a lot of choices based on this newly formed assumption of mine, like I don't unnecessarily keep my mind occupied with worrying about my safety when in 'risky pursuits' like I once used to or ""had to be"" since I was always warned repeatedly by everyone (women) Around me about the hazards etc (even though I hated how it was a woman's job to stay safe rather than it being a basic social requirement). & I now believe that I can rule out certain worrying parameters when making choices, for example I don't feel as cautious or be as vigilant walking alone in secluded places at night as I used to when I was a teenager.

And I believe this is accurate logically too, because as we grow up, we obviously get more educated (not literally, but we get more aware) and that's what makes us less lucrative as potential victims to these evil people. That's the reason they target younger women who they expect to be naive (even though that might be far from reality lol).

Socialism supports Slavery,Conservative,0,ro7fdj,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/ro7fdj/socialism_supports_slavery/,37,"George Fitzhugh (November 4, 1806 – July 30, 1881) was an American social theorist who published racial and slavery-based sociological theories in the antebellum era. He argued that the n\*gro ""is but a grown up child"" who needs the economic and social protections of slavery. Fitzhugh decried capitalism as practiced by the Northern United States and Great Britain as spawning ""a war of the rich with the poor, and the poor with one another"", rendering free blacks ""far outstripped or outwitted in the chase of free competition.""

He was a leading pro-slavery intellectual and spoke for many of the Southern plantation owners.

Fitzhugh: ""Slavery Justified"" (1849), Sociology for the South (1854) and Cannibals All! (1857).

His book, Sociology for the South, or, the Failure of Free Society was George Fitzhugh's most powerful attack on the philosophical foundations of free society. In it, he took on not only Adam Smith, the foundational thinker of capitalism, but also John Locke, Thomas Jefferson, and the entire liberal tradition. He attacked what he called ""private judgement"" which was the idea that people have a mind of their own and that the individual is the primary unit of moral and political value. He argued that free labor and free markets enriched the strong while crushing the weak.Sociology for the South is the first known English-language book to include the term ""sociology"" in its title.

""Slavery,"" he wrote, ""is a form, and the very best form, of socialism.""

""Socialism proposes to do away with free competition; to afford protection and support at all times to the laboring class; to bring about, at least, a qualified community of property, and to associate labor. All these purposes, slavery fully and perfectly attains. ... Socialism is already slavery in all save the master ... Our only quarrel with Socialism is, that it will not honestly admit that it owes its recent revival to the failure of universal liberty, and is seeking to bring about slavery again in some form.""

Cannibals All! was a sharp criticism of the system of ""wage-slavery"" found in the north - a term Fitzhugh popularised in America. Fitzhugh's ideas were based on his view that the ""n\*gro slaves of the South"" were considerably more free than those trapped by the oppression of capitalist exploitation.

He wrote: 'It is the duty of society to protect the weak;' but protection cannot be efficient without the power of control; therefore, 'It is the duty of society to enslave the weak.'

Fitzhugh popularised the economic principle that slavery was what makes civilised countries wealthy.

Fitzhugh's ideas in Cannibals All!, while often used in the defense of anti-abolition, have a more socially egalitarian undertone which attempted to remedy inequalities in ""Property of man.""

Fitzhugh was an extremely influencial intellectual in the Southern states. His ideas resonated with a lot of the influencial families there who saw themselves as protectors of black slaves. Many of those families preferred to keep their slaves during the time of industrialisation in the northen states. Abraham Lincoln is said to have been more angered by George Fitzhugh than by any other pro-slavery writer, yet he unconsciously paraphrased him in his House Divided speech.

Karl Marx and his ideas were happening on another continent at the time and were not as popular as Fitzhugh in those states. Therefore, his ideas of reform could be seen in terms of a non-Marxist socialist ideology. Over time, a lot of the pro-slavery writers came to adopt the principles of socialism. Fitzhugh described the southern slave plantation as ""the beau ideal of communism"".

**Additions**

James Henry Hammond, a democratic senator, consistently compared the South's ""well compensated"" slaves to the free labor of the North, describing the latter as ""scantily compensated"" slaves.

In his speech to the US Senate, in March 4, 1858, he said: ""In all social systems there must be a class to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life...It constitutes the very mudsill of society.""

Mudsill theory is the proposition that there must be, and always has been, a lower class or underclass for the upper classes and the rest of society to rest upon.

In November 1848, a socialist activist gave a speech at the 13th annual meeting of the Rhode Island Anti-Slavery Society that ""went on in an effort to show that wages slavery is as bad as chattel slavery.""

The abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass became infuriated with the socialist speaker and said ""The attempts to place holding property in the soil—on the same footing as holding property in man, was most lame and impotent"".

> We conceptualize state capitalism broadly to capture the three main mechanisms of state intervention in the economy: state ownership, statism, and the degree of threat the governments pose to the private market sphere.

Most reformists who support only social democracy support what the authors define as ""welfare states"": low on ""government threat,"" low on state ownership, and high on what they consider ""statism"" (subsidies, investments, procurements, other indicative planning mechanisms, and regulations).

South Korea is an example of an ""interventionist state"": high on ""government threat,"" low on state ownership, and low on ""statism.""

Singapore, whose government employs over 30% of the workforce, is an example of an ""entrepreneurial state"": low on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and low on ""statism.""

Czechia is an example of the opposite, an ""interventionist welfare state"": high on ""government threat,"" low on state ownership, and high on ""statism.""

Modern Russia is an example of an ""interventionist entrepreneurial state"": high on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and low on ""statism.""  [Unfortunately, as has been argued by Vladislav Inozemtsev, Lenin's New Economic Policy was also low on ""statism.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/piowoj/lenins_new_economic_policy_and_the_russian/)

According to the paper, there is no modern state that has been low on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and high on ""statism.""  No modern state has been an ""entrepreneurial welfare state"" (""entrepreneurial"" in the sense that government competes for business opportunities and assets).

I disagree.  The PRC definitely has subsidies, investments, procurements, other indicative planning mechanisms, and regulations. It is much higher on ""statism"" that what the paper suggests. However, from Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao, the economy has been low on ""government threat.""

On the other hand, Greece is high on ""government threat,"" high on state ownership, and high on ""statism"": an ""interventionist entrepreneurial welfare state.""

Workers of the World: Labor's Potential to Resist Capital is as Strong as Ever,Liberal,3,55utid,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/55utid/workers_of_the_world_labors_potential_to_resist/,0,"Trade unionists in the 1920s didn’t have much reason for optimism. Labor membership, which had shot upwards amid postwar unrest, crested and then plunged. Observers fretted that technological and cultural changes had rendered the labor movement obsolete and workers apathetic. “Our younger members, especially, have gone jazzy,” one union official lamented in the mid 1920s.

A decade later, strikes were blocking production across the country, and union density was skyrocketing.

After years of malaise in the labor movement, is a similar upsurge possible today?

Renowned labor scholar Beverly Silver thinks so. Chair of the sociology department at Johns Hopkins University, Silver has been a radical advocate for workers her whole life. Her award-winning work, including her pathbreaking Forces of Labor, deals with profound questions of labor, development, social conflict, and war. In a recent interview with Jacobin she explained what labor’s past can tell us about the present state — and future — of working-class struggle around the globe. The last few decades have seen a profound restructuring of the working class in the United States and other advanced capitalist countries. What are the broad contours of that restructuring process, and what are the forces driving it?

Capitalism is constantly transforming the organization of production and the balance of power between labor and capital — restructuring the working class, remaking the working class. So to answer this question I think we need to take a longer-term view.

It makes sense to go back to the mid-twentieth century — to the thirties, forties, and fifties. That’s when we first see the emergence of a very strong mass-production working class in the United States, most paradigmatically in the automobile industry but also in sectors like mining, energy, and transportation, which were central to industrialization and trade.

Pretty much right out of the gate after World War II, capital moved to restructure — reconfiguring the organization of production, the labor process, sources of labor supply, and the geographical location of production. This restructuring was in large part a response to strong labor movements in manufacturing and mining, in logistics and transportation.

An expanded version of David Harvey’s concept of the spatial fix is helpful here for understanding this restructuring. Capital tried to resolve the problem of strong labor movements, and the threat to profitability that labor posed, by implementing a series of “fixes.”

Companies utilized a spatial fix by moving to lower-wage sites. They implemented “technological fixes” — reducing their dependence on workers by accelerating automation. And they have been implementing what we can think of as a “financial fix” — moving capital out of trade and production and into finance and speculation as yet another means of reducing dependence on the established, mass-production working class for profits.

The beginnings of this shift of capital to finance and speculation was already visible in the 1970s, but it exploded after the mid 1990s, following the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act during the Clinton years.

So what looked like a sudden collapse in the power of organized labor in the United States in the eighties and nineties was actually rooted in decades of restructuring on these multiple fronts that began in the mid-twentieth century.

Of course, it is important to point out that there is another side of the coin. These capitalist fixes unmade the established mass-production working class, but they simultaneously made new working classes in the United States and elsewhere. These new working classes are emerging as the protagonists of labor struggles in many parts of the world today. It is no secret that the traditional forms of working-class organization, like trade unions in the United States and social-democratic parties in Europe, are in the midst of a severe crisis. How has capital succeeded in undermining and taming these organized expressions of working-class interest?

If we look back in history at high points of labor militancy, particularly those moments involving left movements tied to socialist and working-class parties, a recurrent set of strategies to undermine the radical potential of these movements is apparent. They can be summed up as restructuring, co-optation, and repression.

So, the kinds of restructuring or fixes I mentioned above — geographical relocation, technological change, financialization — certainly played an important role in weakening these movements. In the meantime, the co-optation of trade unions and working-class parties — their incorporation as junior partners into national hegemonic projects and social compacts — also played an important role. Finally, repression was an important part of the mix all along.

Just taking the United States as an example, in the post–World War II decades we see McCarthyism and the expulsion of left and Communist militants from the trade unions. Then, in the sixties and seventies, strong factory- and community-based movements of black workers — the Black Panther Party, the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) — were brought under control by out-and-out repression.

And today — with the militarization of local police forces and the endless “war on terror” creating a hostile environment for the mobilization of immigrant and black workers — coercion continues to play a major role. One of the big debates today is whether the defining dynamic shaping the global working class is exploitation — workers being squeezed at the point of production — or exclusion — workers being essentially locked out of stable wage labor. What are your thoughts on this debate?

I see them as equally important. Certainly it would be a mistake to write off the continuing importance of struggles against exploitation at the point of production. Indeed, one outcome of the spatial-fix strategy has been to create new working classes and labor-capital contradictions wherever capital goes.

In other words, workers’ resistance to exploitation at the point of production has followed the movement of capital around the globe over the past half-century. Indeed, we are witnessing the latest manifestation of this dynamic with the massive wave of labor unrest now taking place in China.

Once it became clear to corporations that simply moving factories to low-wage sites could not solve the problem of labor control, capital came to rely more heavily on automation and financialization. Automation, while hardly new, has recently been expelling wage workers from production at a rapid clip, increasing the visibility of the exclusionary dynamic. A recent glaring illustration is the news that FoxConn has actually followed through with its threat to introduce a massive number of robots into its factories in China.

Likewise, the movement of surplus capital into finance and speculation is also contributing in a major way to the increasing salience of exclusion. Finance — especially those financial activities that are not adjuncts to trade and production — absorbs relatively little wage labor; more importantly, it derives profits primarily from the regressive redistribution of wealth through speculation, rather than the creation of new wealth. Hence the link made by Occupy between obscene levels of class inequality and financialization.

Automation and financialization are leading to an acceleration in the long-term tendency of capitalism to destroy established livelihoods at a much faster rate than it creates new ones. This was always the predominant tendency of historical capitalism in much of the Global South, where dispossession tended to outpace the absorption of wage labor, and thus where workers increasingly had nothing to sell but their labor power, but little chance of actually selling it.

While this tendency is nothing new, both its acceleration and the fact that its negative effects are being felt in core countries — and not just in the Third World — help explain why the exclusionary dynamic has come to the fore in current debates. To frame the question differently, does it even make sense to think of exclusion and exploitation as separate processes?

Well, Marx certainly didn’t view them as separate phenomena. In the first volume of Capital, he argued that the accumulation of capital went hand in hand with the accumulation of a surplus population — that wealth was being created through exploitation, but at the same time big chunks of the working class were excluded or made superfluous to the needs of capital.

For most of the twentieth century, there was an uneven geographical distribution in terms of where the brunt of exclusionary processes was felt. Indeed, until recently, one of the ways capital maintained legitimacy within core countries was by pushing the weight of the exclusionary processes onto the Third World as well as onto marginalized sections of the working class within the core.

The world working class was divided, with boundaries very much defined by citizenship, race, ethnicity, and gender. Today these boundaries are still quite salient, however. Particularly after the 2008 global financial crisis, the weight of exclusionary processes is being felt more heavily in core countries than in the past — with all sorts of political implications. In your work you’ve thought a lot about the power of workers and the working class. You distinguish between different sources of worker power. Can you talk more about that?

Yes, a major distinction is between structural power and associational power. Associational power is the capacity to make gains through trade union and political party organization. Structural power is the power that comes from workers’ strategic location within the process of production — a power that can be, and often has been, exercised in the absence of trade union organization. Why is it useful to make these distinctions?

Well, take structural power, for example. There are two main types of structural power: workplace bargaining power and marketplace bargaining power.

Most of the time, people think about marketplace bargaining power to understand worker power more broadly. If there’s high unemployment, your marketplace bargaining power is low, and vice versa. Workplace bargaining power — the ability to bring interconnected processes of production to a halt through localized work stoppages — is less emphasized, but is perhaps even more important for understanding sources of workers’ power today.

This is because, if you look at long-term historical trends, workers’ power at the point of production is undoubtedly, on balance, increasing. This is surprising to people. But this increased workplace bargaining power is apparent with the spread of just-in-time methods in manufacturing. In contrast to more traditional mass-production methods, no buffers or surpluses are built into the production process.

Thus, with the spread of just-in-time production in the automobile industry, for example, a relatively small number of workers, by simply stopping production in a strategic node — even, say, a windshield-wiper parts supplier — can bring an entire corporation to a standstill. There are plenty of recent examples of this in the automobile industry around the world.

Likewise, workers in logistics — transport and communication — have significant and growing workplace bargaining power tied to the cascading economic impact that stoppages in these sectors would have. Moreover, notwithstanding the almost universal tendency to think of globalization processes as weakening labor, the potential geographical scale of the impacts of these stoppages has increased with globalization. What about associational power? If workers have no unions or labor parties, doesn’t that undermine their structural bargaining power?

Not necessarily. Take the case of China. Autonomous trade unions are illegal, but there have been some major improvements recently in minimum-wage laws, labor laws, and working conditions. These changes have come out of a grassroots upsurge that has taken advantage of workers’ structural power, both in the marketplace and, even more important, in the workplace.

I think we also have to be honest about the ambiguous structural position of trade unions. If they’re too successful and deliver too much to their base, capital becomes extremely hostile and doesn’t want to deal with them and so moves to a more repressive strategy.

Capital will sometimes make deals with trade unions, but only if trade unions agree to play a mediating role, limiting labor militancy and ensuring labor control. But in order to effectively do that, unions have to deliver something to their base, which brings us back to the first problem. Ultimately, the question is: in what kind of situations does this contradictory dynamic between trade unions and capitalists play out to the benefit of workers? What do you think about arguments that struggles are shifting from the point of production to the streets or community?

This brings us back to the earlier question about the relative importance of exploitation and exclusion in shaping the world working class. Looking at the world working class as a whole today, I don’t think it would be accurate to say that struggles are shifting predominantly to the streets, especially if we are talking about struggles that have a serious disruptive impact on business as usual.

Struggles at the point of production continue to be an important component of overall world labor unrest. At the same time, the excluded — the unemployed and those with weak structural power — have no choice but to make their voices heard through direct action in the streets rather than direct action in the workplace.

The coexistence of struggles at the workplace and struggles in the street has been a feature of capitalism historically, as has the coexistence of exploitation and exclusion. Sometimes these two types of struggles proceed without intersecting in solidarity with each other, especially since, historically, the working class has been divided — both within countries and between countries — in the degree to which their experience is primarily shaped by the dynamics of exclusion or the dynamics of exploitation.

But if we think of major successful waves of labor unrest, they combined, in explicit or implicit solidarity, both of these kinds of struggles. Even the Flint factory occupation and subsequent 1936 and ’37 strike wave — a movement that was fundamentally based on leveraging workers’ power at the point of production — was made more potent by simultaneous struggles in the streets of unemployed workers and community solidarity.

Or, if we think of a recent mass movement that was widely seen as taking place almost entirely in the streets — Egypt in 2011 — it was when the Suez Canal workers leveraged their workplace bargaining power with a strike in support of the mass movement in the streets that Mubarak was forced to step down. It is also interesting to note that the April 6 youth movement that initiated the occupation of Tahrir Square was founded in 2008 to support a major strike by industrial workers.

So a fundamental problem for the Left today, which is also not new, is to figure out how to combine workplace bargaining power and the power of the street — to find the nodes of connection between unemployed, excluded, and exploited wage workers. This is almost certainly easier when the excluded and exploited are members of the same households or the same communities.

In the United States, we can see glimmers of these intersections with the 2015 dockworkers’ strike in California in support of Black Lives Matter mobilizations in the streets, and with the way the community and workplace struggles of immigrant workers intersect. In the United States today, it seems like a major focus of labor organizing and activism is on the lowest-wage workers in the service sectors. What do you make of this? Is this where we should be focusing our energies? Or should we be looking at different kinds of workers in different industries and sectors?

It’s not a mistake to place a big emphasis on these workers. If you’re going to raise the conditions of the majority of the population, you have to raise the conditions of these workers.

I think part of the skepticism inherent in this question is that so far this strategy hasn’t been very successful. Again, thinking about workplace bargaining power is useful here. At Walmart, for example, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to hit the retail side. You have to hit the distribution side.

The same goes for fast food. If you hit the distribution side, then you can leverage workplace bargaining power. Otherwise, you are left with a struggle that is confined to the streets. But this also leads us back to the question of how and when workers with strong workplace bargaining power exercise that power in support of broader transformational goals. Along with Giovanni Arrighi, you have argued that the trajectory of the workers’ movements in the United States and other national contexts are profoundly influenced by their relationship to broader movements in global politics, wars, and international conflicts. How have recent geopolitical shifts affected the strength of labor in the United States?

This is a very big and important question. I think a lot of the discussion of labor movements tends to focus on the economic side, but the geopolitical side is equally, if not more, important for understanding the prospects and possibilities for workers and workers’ movements, historically and going forward.

Fifteen years ago, right before September 11, it looked like we were on the verge of a mass upsurge of labor unrest in the United States, with a strong epicenter among immigrant workers. There were a number of major strikes that had been planned or were in progress, and then the dynamic shifted.

The war on terror gave a major boost to coercion and repression in maintaining the status quo, and not just in the workplace, in terms of employer hostility to trade unions, but more broadly, in terms of the impact of the permanent war environment on the prospects for organizing. Coercion and repression seem to be fundamental to capitalism. What’s different today in the relationship between workers, workers’ movements, and geopolitics?

Well, I think to answer this question it is important to place the current permanent war environment within the context of the broader crisis of US world power and hegemonic decline.

And we need to look at the long-term historical relationship between workers’ rights and the reliance of states on the working class to fight wars. Let’s discuss the latter first.

One of the well-known, but not widely discussed, roots of labor strength — or at least the institutionalization of trade unions and the deepening of democratic rights in the United States and in Western Europe, and to some extent globally — was the particular nature of war in the twentieth century, including the industrialization of the means of war and mass conscription.

To fight this type of war, the core powers, the imperial powers, needed the cooperation of the working class, both as soldiers fighting at the front and as workers keeping the factories going. War-making depended on industrial production for everything from armaments to boots. Hence the common wisdom during both world wars was that whoever kept the factories running would win the war.

In this context worker cooperation was key, and the relationship between war-making and civil unrest was unmistakable. The two biggest peaks of world labor unrest in the twentieth century, by far, were the years immediately following World War I and World War II. The troughs of labor unrest were in the midst of the wars themselves.

It’s also no coincidence that the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement was in the aftermath of World War II and the Korean War, and that the height of the Black Power Movement came during and after the Vietnam War.

States sought to secure the cooperation of workers through the mobilization of nationalist and patriotic sentiments, but this was not sustainable without tangible advances in workers’ rights. Thus, expansions of the welfare state went hand in hand with expansions of the warfare state in the twentieth century.

Put differently: working-class nationalism could only trump working-class internationalism if states showed that winning wars meant rising standards of living and expanding rights for workers as both workers and citizens. Do you think this is still the case today, in the context of seemingly permanent warfare?

The nature of war has changed today in many respects. Just like capital reorganized production in response to the strength of labor, so has the state restructured the military to lessen its dependence on workers and citizens to wage war.

The mass movement against the Vietnam War, and the refusal of soldiers at the front in Vietnam to go on fighting, was a turning point, triggering a fundamental restructuring of the organization and nature of war-making.

We see the results of this restructuring today with the end of mass conscription and the increasing automation of warfare. With the growing reliance on drones and other high-tech weaponry, US soldiers are being removed from direct danger — not entirely, but much more than in the past.

This is a different situation than the one that linked workers’ movements and warfare in the twentieth century. The welfare and warfare states have become uncoupled in the twenty-first century. Whether, under these changing conditions, working-class internationalism will trump working-class nationalism is a critical but unresolved question.

I have focused on the United States in this discussion, but the transformation in the nature of war-making has broader impacts. In the mid-twentieth century, many colonial countries were incorporated into the imperial war process as suppliers of both soldiers and materials for the war effort, leading to an analogous strengthening and militancy of the working class.

Today, in country after country in a wide swath of the Global South, you have a situation in which modern US war-making is leading to the wholesale disorganization and destruction of the working class in places where high-tech weaponry is being dropped. The current “migrant crisis,” both its roots and its repercussions, is a deeply disturbing blowback from this new age of war. In previous periods, rising tides of militancy and organization have tended to bring with them new and powerful organizational forms. In the nineteenth century it was the craft union, in the twentieth century it was the industrial union. Are these forms doomed to historical oblivion, and if so, what might replace them?

They’re certainly not doomed to historical oblivion. In the United States, for example, some of the most successful unions today — in terms of recruiting new members and militancy — are the ones that have their roots in the old AFL, in the craft-worker tradition. Some people say elements of that old organizing style are more suitable to the horizontal nature of current workplaces, rather than the industrial unions associated with vertically integrated corporations.

But this doesn’t mean industrial unions are dead, either. The types of successes that were characteristic of the classic CIO unions — the Flint sit-down strike in the engine plant and the strikes beyond that — relied on the strategic bargaining power of workers at the point of production. I think that there are still lessons to be learned from these successes.

Clearly neither of these forms succeeded in touching the fundamental problems of capitalism, however. As I already mentioned, the problem with trade unions is that, to the extent that they are too effective, capital and the state have no interest in working with them and cooperating.

Yet to the extent that they — and this is largely what’s happened — don’t deliver a serious transformation in the life and livelihoods of workers, they lose credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of workers themselves.

I think we constantly see both sides of this contradiction. The trade unions are part of the solution but are not the full solution. One of the ideas that Marx advocated for is imploring trade unions to connect with the unemployed in a single organization. Is that an option in places like the United States?

I think that it’s certainly the ideal — it’s what Marx and Engels were talking about in the Communist Manifesto in terms of the role of communists in the labor movement.

It also brings us back to the questions about the relationship between processes of exploitation and exclusion and about the relationship between struggles at the point of production and struggles in the street.

For trade unions seeking to follow Marx’s directive, it means thinking strategically about the conditions under which workers with stable waged employment can be drawn into and be radicalized by the struggles of the unemployed and precariously employed, and vice versa. What are the prospects for labor revitalization in the United States? Do you expect to see an upsurge in militancy and organization in the near future?

On the one hand, let me say that I do, just on theoretical grounds, expect an upsurge of labor militancy in the United States, and not just in the United States. On an empirical level, since 2008, we have been witnessing an upsurge worldwide in class-based social unrest, which may be seen in retrospect as the beginnings of a longer-term revitalization.

This assessment goes against the prevailing sentiment. It’s interesting to compare the current pessimism to what was being said by experts in the 1920s. At that time, they were looking at the ways in which craft workers were being undermined by the expansion of mass production, and they were claiming that the labor movement was mortally weakened and permanently dead. They were saying that right up until the eve of the mass wave of labor unrest in the mid 1930s.

They didn’t understand that, while it was true that a lot of the craft-worker unions were being undermined, there was a new working class in formation. We see the same thing today — a situation where there is a twentieth-century mass-production working class that’s being undermined, but there is also a new working class in formation, including in manufacturing.

It’s important not to just wipe manufacturing out of the consciousness of what’s happening even in the United States, much less in the world as a whole. Nevertheless, each time new waves of labor unrest erupt, the working class looks fundamentally different, and the strategies and mobilization again are fundamentally different. Who do you think would lead the upsurge this time around?

It’s hard to say. What is clearer are the critical issues facing labor today, and to some extent these point to the mass base and leadership needed for a “next upsurge” that is transformational. We’re in a situation where capital is destroying livelihoods at a much faster pace than it’s creating new ones, so we’re experiencing on a global scale, including in core countries and the United States, an expansion of the surplus population, and particularly what Marx referred to in Capital as the stagnant surplus population: those who are really never going to be incorporated into stable wage labor.

Contingent workers, temporary workers, part-time workers, and the long-term unemployed — this whole group is expanding, leading us down the road to pauperism. Notwithstanding the deep crisis of legitimacy this is creating for capitalism, there’s nothing, no tendency within capitalism itself, to go in a different direction. If we are going to change directions, it’s going to have to come from a mass political movement, rather than something coming out of capital itself.

There are two other important points to consider. One is that capitalist profitability, throughout its history, has depended on the partial externalization of not only the cost of reproduction of labor, but also the cost of reproduction of nature. This externalization is becoming increasingly untenable and unsustainable, but there’s also no inherent tendency within capital to redirect this.

Moreover, since the treatment of nature as a free good was a pillar of the postwar social compact tying mass production to the promise of working-class mass consumption, no simple return to the so-called golden age of Keynesianism and developmentalism is possible.

Second, the historical tendency in capitalism to resolve economic and political crises through expansionist, militaristic policies and war is something we have to take seriously, particularly in the current period of US hegemonic crisis and decline.

Getting control over oil, grabbing resources, fighting over sea lanes in the South China Sea — these struggles have the potential for incredibly horrific outcomes for humanity as a whole. To avoid this, a renewed and updated labor internationalism will have to overcome the visible tendencies toward a resurgent and atavistic labor nationalism.

So a consideration of geopolitics — examining the links between militarism, domestic conflict, and labor movements — is where we need to begin and end any serious analysis. The old question of socialism or barbarism is as relevant today as it has ever been.

Ok so what do you think? I despise Winston Churchill for being a disgusting imperialist but I think he did more to save Europe from Nazism than Stalin.

I understand that Stalin wanted to join West in an anti-Nazi pact[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/Stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-Hitler-if-Britain-and-France-agreed-pact.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/Stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-Hitler-if-Britain-and-France-agreed-pact.html) but Stalin also wanted to join Axis[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet\_Axis\_talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%E2%80%93Soviet_Axis_talks).

It looks like Stalin was playing both sides.

Honestly no one can ignore the amount of oil and other aid given by Soviet Union to Nazi Germany. They essentially created the Nazi war machine.

Information
------------------------------
A midwife is fighting against sexism in India. As India's so-called ""village of men"" demonstrates, a society without women has no future.

In India, a girl is aborted every 12 seconds. Every 22 minutes a woman is raped. The connection between these two statistics is as startling as it is terrifying.

Illegal ultrasounds to detect and abort female foetuses have become increasingly popular over the past two decades. So-called ""sterile villages"", where not a single girl has been born in decades, are scattered throughout India. As a result, the world's largest democracy is on the verge of collapse.

There may be as many as 32 million single Indian men by 2025. Increased levels of violence towards women looms on the horizon. Filmmaker Rama Rau's film paints an intimate portrait of these untenable conditions.

"Democracy, Capitalism and our conception of man",Liberal,32,sfh1o3,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sfh1o3/democracy_capitalism_and_our_conception_of_man/,12,"We are living through a crisis of democracy, I think this statement is rather uncontroversial (in this subreddit at least anyways). In this post I want to discuss some of the possible reasons for that.

*How capitalism kills democracies.* Now I do not know how controversial it is to say that capitalism kills democracies. But I think that that is the case and here is why:

1. It leaves people behind.
2. It fails education
3. it causes massive inequality
4. Greed is not everything.
5. Possible solutions1- *it \[capitalism\] leaves people behind*  
This is an issue for democracy, since people who are being left behind often feel alienated and powerless, and ask themselves why should I even bother to go out and vote? I cannot change anything anyways, the elites do whatever they want anyways…This kind of thinking is of course wrong since everyone vote matters the same (well maybe with the exception of the US Presidential elections and other federal elections but I’ll ignore that for now) This often least to people doing one of to things:Radicalise, we see that in many poor US states the Republican party is really strong even though the republicans economics effects poor people the most, but why is that?  I think it is because they offer easy solutions. They say it is not your fault that you lost your job, it it because of the immigrants taking our (by that they mean white people) jobs, the Gays and Transes are destroying our culture. There is too much government etc. those are easy solutions, It is not your fault but other peoples and I think that is pretty attraktive when you have lost everything.second: The other thing that could happen is that you just do not vote at all, lose interest and faith in democracy. This is bad too since it makes it pretty hard to win someone who thinks that they cannot change anything anyways. Another group of people that are being left behind are disabled people, since they often can work as much as they would need to to survie on their own under capitalism, and I cannot stress enough that that is really bad since it is absolutely no fault of your own that you are disabled (both mentally and physically) and yet your worth on the makred of the labour force is much much lower simply by your being disabled.  
*It fails education*  
Now This is an issue that can be fixed fairly easily (ill get to that later)  but all to often we do not invest enough into education which is bad since a well educated population that is media literate, has a basic understanding of how since works and what facts are is the base of a working democracy. Also we all to often just teach the wrong stuff (more on that in 5.)  
*It causes massive inequality*  
Inequality is not good for democracy, because it \[democracy\] relies on that everyone has (roughly) equal power, this however this is not achieved under the current economic system.Capitalism leads to wealth inequality due to generational wealth, wealth amassing by the rich (by that I mean it is way easier to get even richer if you are already rich) and the fact that employers have a lot of power, the can control hoe much money you make, when you have free time and such. This wealth that is hold by a few people is a issue that is exaborbaited by the fact that you can spend (almost) everywhere as much money to a party or canidate as you wish. –> hugely unbleached power. This power that the rich gain through their wealth enables them to lobby for economic policies that benefit them not the masses. An example for this is Universal healthcare in the US and Germany\*. In the US poll after poll shows that a huge majority of the US poplulation wants some kind of universal state run healthcare system, yet there is no such thing in the works right now, no bill in the US congress and such. Why? Because the rich bought the politicians to oppose it, personal responsibility or something like that, the marked will solve the issue Muhhh freedom. In Germany poll after poll shows that a huge majority of the population (around 69% as of  last September) wants a single state run insurance in place of the mess of public and private once that we have right now, yet that will not happen since the CDU and FDP belive that that is a bad Idea, free marked something muh.This is not good.  
*Greed is not everything*  
Anothery way capitalism is anti democratic and poisons society is by making greed everything.When Milton Friedman was ask if he ever had any doubt about capitalism in light of the massive inequality \[…\] he awnsered “Do you know any society that does’t run on greed” Do we really should ask ourselfs, if that is the way we want to live. Do we really want to live in a world where only egoism matters, where capital is everything? I do not think that is something we should strive for, I think a world where capital is everything and feelings like compassion, solidarity and altruism do not matter is not a good idea. The current economic system assumes that greed is everything, but it ignores that humans are much more complex than that. Be honest, is greed the motivation for everything you do? Are humans really only egoistic in nature? Do you want to live in a world where greed capital and the stigma grind set are everything? I personally don‘t want to do that. Capitalism however has screwed up the conception of man for many many people. Many people think that greed is everthing that success can only be measured in money, but that leaves out so much ouf the Human nature.I wanna quote here u/virbrevis since they the in really good words when I asked them about it  (on the subs Discord)  
 “I think capitalism promotes quite twisted and terrible social values that conflict with the ideas of, say, community, of family, of co-operation and friendship, capitalism conflicts with humanist and Christian values, and so on.It promotes greed, gluttony, envy, a radical individualism (the atomisation of society). It promotes ruthless competition in every sphere of life, and the commodification of every sphere of life. \[…\] That makes capitalism harmful then to the individual, to society, to politics and to the economy.”  
And I agree with that and it is also not hard to see why that might also cause problems for democracy. When everyone just votes in their one interests, then that becomes a huge issue for democracy. It is supposed to be the rule of the people, but when it becomes ruled be selfish intererst and distrust in one another, that leads to the “atomasiation of society” and also the fall of democracys. This can be observed in hyper capitalist nations like the US.    
*How do we fix this mess?*    
Obviously  there is no one easy solution to such a complex and systemic issue and who claims otherwise is lying. However I think that there are some things that could be done. First we should try to build up a robust welfare state in oder to ensure that nobody is left behind. Then we need to make our education system better and more equal, ensure that everybody can persue their goals as they wish without aquiring massive Student debt. We should also redistribute money and ban party donations lager than a few hundert Euros for private persons and ban companys all together from donating. Franky there is a lot more to this and that could be done in a soc dem / dem soc framework.    
I think that we (leftists in general) should spend more energy on these societal issues. I do not know how to fix that consumerism, but we should try to find an awnser. You can put your ideas and thoughs below here (obvio).

Since mixed market economies, such as Social Democracy, has both Free Market Capitalism and Welfare Socialism in the same space, I’m genuinely curious how does the Capitalist side work in the same space as the latter.

"""Black Box"" Topics (Ideological Oppression)",Liberal,2,spsvpf,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/spsvpf/black_box_topics_ideological_oppression/,0,"(Narrated version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVmn4CgKP9w))

As a Midwesterner, I’ve had my entire life to observe the traits of a culture that spans across the lowly populated areas of America and there are a few things that, to me, stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, one of the biggest just so happens to be our avoidance of what I like to call “black box” topics. This includes sexuality, money, religion, and politics. It’s frankly a very lazy way of going about difficult discourse. 

So, to back up a bit, Midwestern social culture is a lot about keeping to yourself. Not bothering someone over the little things and not getting into anyone’s business. This doesn’t keep your occasional American from being visually and audibly loud and obnoxious, but even then, the chances that someone is going to call you out for that kind of thing are minimal. The Midwest's “keep to yourself” culture oozes its way into social interactions, and like jazz, is less about what you do, and more about what you don't do.

So what’s the big hubbub about these “black box” topics? Why are they so important, and why does the Midwestern social culture hammer into our minds that such things should be avoided? I’d argue that these four topics, in one way or another, are connected to traditional ideals that are uncomfortable to question. Sexuality can be under the umbrella of such things as contraceptives, abortion, or LGBT topics. As for money, one might get too close to questioning capitalism if such discussions were followed to their conclusions. Politics as many stubborn people hold views that follow tradition or the general politics of their parents and the state they live in. And religion? I doubt that one needs explaining.

Disallowing the discussion of these important topics is a factor of control. If sexuality isn’t discussed, then your school has complete power over whether you get “abstinence only” schooling, or a real sexual education. If discussions about money are suppressed, it’s much harder for people to sympathize with the struggles of lower-income citizens, and can make it harder for employees under the same employer to realize they’re not being paid fairly across the board. If religion isn’t discussed, people won’t realize that there are other options than just abrahamic religions, and that some terrible people hide behind the bible to mask being bigoted. If political discussion is silenced, then we will never learn how to maturely discuss pressing issues and we stay very ignorant of basic historical facts.

This is all just the tip of the iceberg, but my general point is you can’t ban anything. Banning drugs leads to misuse, banning abortions leads to many unsafe ones, banning firearms can lead to people buying them off of the black market, but most importantly: banning certain kinds of discussions leads to a mentally numbed populace. For the rest of this essay, I’m going to elaborate on how specifically these four “black box topics” can harm us when we avoid discussion of them.

Firstly, and this will be a quick one, religion. As I said before, an open discussion about this topic would make it a lot harder for cowardly bigots to hide behind religious ideology as their reasoning for discrimination. One could just simply admit to being bigoted, but instead they try to look for something to hide behind so the blame would instead fall upon the institution of religion instead of themselves as an individual. Additionally, more open discussion about religion would break the cycle of indoctrination that is the passing down of the same religion from generation to generation in a family. The problem I have with this is that young people of a society don’t have the capacity to understand religion, and instead usually believe in it to impress their parents or gain brownie points with the community, but secondly, religion should be chosen based on unbiased theological study. One should learn about every belief system there is to be offered, and pick one from there. Not only does this save someone the hardship of having to leave a religion later in life which devastates their clergy, but it gives one insight on other religions and forms a sense of oneness with other beliefs, making it harder to discriminate against the others.

Getting to sexuality, this seems to be a topic that more parts of the US ignore than just Midwesterners. There are plentiful downsides to avoiding discussions about sexuality. [Of course, one of the biggest being the increase in teen pregnancies when a school decides to teach “abstinence only” instead of legitimate sexual education](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/08/23/545289168/abstinence-education-is-ineffective-and-unethical-report-argues). People are going to have sex before marriage, might as well teach them how to use contraceptives before they upset conservatives again when they have to get an abortion. Teen pregnancies and contraceptives aren’t the only important facets of the discussion on sexuality. Whether or not we teach LGBTQ+ topics in classes about sexuality and sexual health has been a political topic for some time. On one hand you have the right whining that this will indoctrinate their kids, but on the other hand, I see this kind of education being extremely important. Not being taught about homosexuality doesn’t keep someone from being homosexual, it just keeps them from understanding how they feel, romantically and sexually, later on in life. Different identities should be taught in school sexuality classes, and myths should be debunked there too. America was once in a time where we thought AIDs was spread by simply touching someone and that homosexuals had literally thousands of sexual partners. Lastly, it’s my belief that both sexes should be taught about both reproductive systems. It’s pathetic that so many men don’t know what PMS is or don’t know how period hygiene products work.

Now on to money. This one seems to be pretty common to avoid too. Partially because being open about or flaunting one’s socioeconomic status is looked down upon. It is both shameful and embarrassing to be openly poor, but also kinda douchey to be openly rich. As I described earlier, keeping quiet the discussions about money can [make it easier for an employer to pay people unfairly giving the employer a higher ground in pay negotiations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xH7eGFuSYI). As for outside the workplace, a lack of discussion about money can keep many well-to-do people or middle class people from being sympathetic to those of other incomes and financial situations. For instance, when I was still in high school, I was talking with a kid in my class who had a father that had a well-paying job. The discussion got into how California is expensive and about poverty in general. This kid, we will call him Kevin for the sake of this essay, told me that the poor have nothing to worry about. That they can move easily, especially if they get an employer that will pay for them to move like his dad’s did. Of course, I knew this was a bunch of bullshit; one of my boyfriends had to move to my home state because it was cheaper than California and there’s no way that his mother would have gotten a job here that would pay for her to move, that’s rare. The problem here is that Kevin assumed that everyone else, including the poor, had the same opportunities that his dad did. This is called “egocentrism”, and it can lead a lot of middle to upper class people to believe that the reason the poor are poor isn’t due to lack of opportunity, but instead laziness or foolishness. Hate is ignorance, and just as racism is a result of ignorance, so too is hate of the poor. This is why conversations about money are so important, and need to stop being taboo.

Lastly, politics. Setting aside my own biases, there is so much that could be gained from more conversations on politics. The way I see it, there are a lot of people who don't research a topic or don’t have any nuance that still think their opinions are factual. Obviously, I’m not going to give an opinion on an academic or political subject unless I research it, because otherwise, I’d be spreading harmful misinformation. There are so many people that believe basic myths such as: “The Nazis were socialist”, “Stalin/Communism killed 100 million people”, “Antifa is fascist”, “Any radical politics are bad”, etc. Our historical education is painfully basic and leaves out lots of details or [alters them to give you a different mindset of history that more so benefits your country than the truth](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/india-modi-culture/). Biased historical education allows a country to put a lens on someone’s view of the world to keep them from having any thoughts or opinions that might harm existing power structures. It’s never really fully explained why communism is bad in any of the history classes I was in as a kid, but that sure didn’t stop many people from believing it was terrible without second-guessing it. Same for making tons of students believe that our country is the best, or that the ones we went to war with are barbaric, or that our democracy is completely functional. History isn’t objective when there are many people who will interpret it differently. That is why discussion about history and politics is so important. It allows us to challenge our views and expand our knowledge on a subject that is seldom properly taught in American public schooling.

Here’s the takeaway; there is a reason I hate this culture of avoiding “black box” topics, and it’s an ideological power structure. By keeping people ignorant, you can rip them off as an employer, suppress sexual and economic freedom, and get your populace to follow politics that reinforce oppressive power structures. We all need to understand that avoiding a topic is lazy, and we should instead be taught how to have conversations about difficult topics instead of outright avoiding them.",1644562201.0

Workers Vanguard No. 109 29 July 2016

Remembering Hiroshima, Nagasaki

U.S. Imperialist Mass Murder

Seventy-one years ago this August, some 200,000 residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were incinerated when U.S. warplanes dropped atomic bombs in the closing weeks of World War II. Many thousands who survived the nuclear holocaust suffered hideous burns and deformities compounded by sheer terror. This monstrous crime—carried out in the name of fighting for “democracy”—epitomizes the savagery of the capitalist-imperialist world order. Hearing the news of the 6 August 1945 attack on Hiroshima, which was followed by the destruction of Nagasaki three days later, U.S. president Harry Truman exulted: “This is the greatest thing in history!” and gloated that “we are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely.” The visit of Barack Obama to Hiroshima in May of this year was the first by a sitting U.S. president.

Our forebears of the then-revolutionary Socialist Workers Party (SWP) immediately condemned the bombings as part of their opposition to the U.S. and all capitalist powers in the interimperialist war. This position was coupled with the SWP’s unconditional military defense of the Soviet Union, a degenerated workers state. While the Stalinist U.S. Communist Party grotesquely hailed the A-bomb attacks as part of its craven support to the “democratic” imperialists, SWP leader James P. Cannon, who had been hauled off to prison along with 17 other party leaders and Minneapolis Teamsters officials for their principled opposition to the war, declared in a speech in New York City:

“What a commentary on the real nature of capitalism in its decadent phase is this, that the scientific conquest of the marvelous secret of atomic energy, which might rationally be used to lighten the burdens of all mankind, is employed first for the wholesale destruction of half a million people.”

—“The Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” 22 August 1945, printed in The Struggle for Socialism in the “American Century” (Pathfinder Press, 1977)

Cannon ended the talk with a call to build a Leninist workers party that would fight to “answer the imperialist program of war on the peoples of the world, with revolution at home and peace with the peoples of the world.”

The A-bombs created a special kind of hell. But so did the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo a few months before, which took at least 100,000 lives. For its part, Japanese imperialism had demonstrated its own barbarity by the 1937 Nanjing Massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese by Japanese troops. In Europe, the Nazi regime carried out industrial genocide against Jews, gays, Gypsies and others. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Britain slaughtered hundreds of thousands of German working people by firebombing Dresden, Hamburg and other cities.

U.S. atrocities against the Japanese population were prepared with the kind of virulently racist propaganda that the Nazis used to ostracize Jews and other so-called untermenschen on their way to annihilating them, and which the Japanese rulers spewed against Chinese, Koreans and others they subjugated. The U.S. capitalist press continually depicted the Japanese as “sneak attackers,” hurling venom against “yellow monkeys” or, in the snootier words of the New York Times, against “a beast which sometimes stands erect.” This poison delivered the message: anything could be done to this enemy. And it was long lasting. In 1995, the Smithsonian Institution canceled a planned exhibition on Hiroshima featuring the Enola Gay—the B-29 that dropped the first A-bomb—after a furious reaction from jingoists and militarists objecting to photographs showing the horrors suffered by Japanese civilians.

Official duplicity was the order of the day when on May 27 Barack Obama visited Hiroshima’s memorial to the victims of the A-bomb. Obama had made clear that he would not bother with an apology for the slaughter carried out by his Democratic Party predecessor, which would have been an empty gesture in any case. Instead, he displayed the lying, hypocritical cant that has been a hallmark of his time in office. Obama haughtily declared that countries like the U.S. with nuclear stockpiles “must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them.” Just a few months earlier, he had rolled out a plan to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next three decades, to the tune of $1 trillion!

Obama’s Hiroshima visit was part of a big lie. His amen corner in the U.S. media regurgitated the line that the A-bombs were what forced Japan’s surrender in the war. In fact, Japan was already on the verge of defeat when Truman learned of the successful atomic bomb test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. At the time, he was in Potsdam, Germany, for talks with Britain’s Winston Churchill and Soviet leader J. V. Stalin over the postwar division of Europe following Germany’s military defeat. The Red Army had smashed Hitler’s forces, at the cost of 27 million Soviet lives. With Soviet troops occupying half of Europe and poised to enter the war against Japan, the A-bombs were above all a message to Moscow of the lengths to which the American rulers would go to assert world domination.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied forces in West Europe during the war and later U.S. president, noted in a 1963 interview that the Japanese were ready to surrender and “it wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.” Washington knew from decoded cables that many in the Japanese government were looking for a peace settlement, but the U.S. insisted on unconditional surrender, thereby ensuring that Japan would not give in until the bombs were dropped. As we emphasized in “Behind U.S. Imperialism’s Nuclear Holocaust” (WV No. 628, 8 September 1995), “The A-bombing of Japan was in fact the first act of the emerging Cold War aimed at destroying the Soviet degenerated workers state.”

Washington’s purpose was further made clear by its ongoing attempt, soon to be successful, to develop a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb to gain another leg up on the Soviets, who the U.S. feared were about to build their own A-bomb. Moscow countered by developing a substantial nuclear arsenal, reaching rough parity with the U.S. in the 1970s. For decades, the Soviet arsenal helped stay the hand of U.S. imperialism. But following the capitalist counterrevolution that destroyed the USSR in 1991-92, the arrogant American rulers saw no obstacle to world domination, setting the stage for a series of wars and occupations from the Balkans to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Excluding the Soviet Union, World War II, like WWI, was fought between imperialist powers for resources, markets and spheres of exploitation. China was the special prize of the Pacific War. But the U.S. was denied that part of the spoils of its victory over Japan by the 1949 Chinese Revolution, which created a workers state that, despite bureaucratic deformation, remains the chief target of imperialist designs in Asia. Indeed, the main purpose of Obama’s trip to Southeast and East Asia in May was to firm up U.S. allies and quislings as they tighten a military ring around China.

In Hiroshima, Obama pitched the strategic U.S.-Japanese alliance, which centrally targets China and also the North Korean deformed workers state. Another piece of Washington’s Asian fortress fell into place in July when the South Korean government agreed to host the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system. Ostensibly a response to North Korea’s testing of new ballistic missiles, Thaad’s radar array can cover a broad swath of China, potentially degrading China’s land-based nuclear deterrent.

U.S. and Japanese workers must stand with China and North Korea in their efforts to develop nuclear weapons and delivery systems that provide a measure of defense against imperialist blackmail and attack. Defense of the remaining deformed workers states is inseparable from the struggle to sweep away the capitalist system, with its insatiable thirst for profit and its inherent drive toward war. In opposing the U.S.-Japanese imperialist alliance, we join with our comrades of the Spartacist Group Japan, who wrote in marking the 50th anniversary of the atomic bomb attacks: “Nanjing, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chilling examples of the slaughter and devastation that will be repeated in a coming war if the imperialist bourgeoisie is not overthrown by proletarian socialist revolution” (“Hiroshima, Nagasaki: U.S. War Crimes,” WV No. 627, 25 August 1995).

About negligence and prevention,Conservative,1,49646b,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/49646b/about_negligence_and_prevention/,3,"Take this example given by Rothbard:

>Suppose, for example, that A builds a building, sells it to B, and it promptly collapses. A should be liable for injuring B's person and property and the liability should be proven in court, which can then enforce the proper measures of restitution and punishment. But if the legislature has imposed building codes and inspections in the name of ""safety,"" innocent builders (that is, those whose buildings have not collapsed) are subjected to unnecessary and often costly rules, with no necessity by government to prove crime or damage. They have committed no tort or crime, but are subject to rules, often only distantly related to safety, in advance by tyrannical governmental bodies. Yet, a builder who meets administrative inspection and safety codes and then has a building of his collapse, is often let off the hook by the courts. After all, has he not obeyed all the safety rules of the government, and hasn't he thereby received the advance imprimatur of the authorities?

Although the concept intuitively makes sense, it doesn't seem to hold when you consider others who are put at risk by negligence. For instance, B might have willingly and knowingly accepted to live in A's irresponsibly built building, however the building might collapse in C's house. Of course a building may collapse even with safety regulations in place, and the cause must be determined and proper action taken. It is also clear that the building might stay intact even with no regulations in place. Nevertheless, it is far more likely to collapse when regulations are violated, and given enough negligence it is bound to happen. What's to protect C from A's aggression if no measures are taken to prevent it? Isn't the negligence in itself an aggression? ",1457243243.0

I often here conflicted things about absolute poverty in developed countries.

Sure enough official statistics are that only around 1% of the population lives in such utter destitution.

But on the other hand think tanks say this or that about how even families well above the relative poverty line (ie 50% of the *national* median) cannot afford food or shelter or childcare. For example, one Canadian think tank says that a working family needs well over 37K a year to afford basic needs in my city, which is well above the Canadian federal poverty line of 28K a year.

Workers Vanguard No. 1125 12 January 2018

Mexico: Earthquakes and Capitalist Criminal Negligence

The following article has been translated from Espartaco No. 48 (December 2017), which is published by the Grupo Espartaquista de México, section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist).

Again on September 19, this time at 1:14 p.m., a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico. At the time, the anniversary of the earthquake that devastated Mexico City in 1985 and left an estimated 20,000 dead and 100,000 homeless was being commemorated. It would appear to be calculated cruelty: the new earthquake struck a little over two hours after a national disaster drill took place. Barely 12 days earlier, an even more powerful 8.2 magnitude earthquake had rocked [the states of] Oaxaca and Chiapas.

In Mexico City, scenes from 1985 were replayed. On one hand were the terror and dismay of the population, millions of whom were scarred for life by the 1985 tragedy. On the other hand, thousands of youth and workers voluntarily mobilized to begin rescue work and gather and distribute food and tools. A contingent of Central American immigrants on their way to the U.S. border stopped in Oaxaca to offer help, risking deportation, while the Cuban deformed workers state sent a brigade of doctors, despite its scarcity of resources and the hostility of [Mexican president Enrique] Peña Nieto (a lackey of yanqui imperialism).

Even if the scale of this tragedy was not close to that of 1985, according to official figures the recent earthquakes left 471 people dead, mainly in Mexico City, where 228 died. Eighty-three people died in Oaxaca and 74 in Morelos state. Although the disaster in Mexico City’s exclusive Roma and Condesa neighborhoods dominated the news, poor areas in the south of the capital were practically devastated, as were impoverished towns in Oaxaca, Morelos, Chiapas and Puebla. Hundreds of thousands of Mexico City inhabitants were left without potable water. According to the Secretary of the Interior, 2.3 million people were left homeless in Oaxaca and Chiapas. But it isn’t nature that should be blamed as centrally responsible for the loss of human lives—it’s the capitalist system, which necessarily generates class inequality and subordinates the very lives of the poor to the production of profits.

When the bourgeoisie and its government speak of “natural disasters,” they are simply trying to cover up the criminal negligence and priorities of the capitalist system. Some of the collapsed buildings in the capital were poorly built multifamily residential buildings intended to house workers’ families; other buildings had been opened only a few months before they caved in. In rural and semi-rural areas, many of the homes that collapsed had been built or expanded by workers or peasants on their own, with whatever materials they could afford and with scant structural planning.

The earthquakes exposed a small part of the enormous web of corruption connected to the unfettered real estate speculation that unites all levels of the government, the capitalist parties (the PRI [ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party], the PAN [right-wing National Action Party], the PRD [nationalist-populist Party of the Democratic Revolution], Morena [Movement for National Regeneration, a split from the PRD], etc.) and private consortiums. Between 2000 and 2012, under federal PAN governments some seven million homes of “social interest” (for the poor) were built, the bulk of which are simply uninhabitable—rinky-dink dumps in remote housing developments lacking any services, prone to fire and likely to collapse with the wind and rain.

A handful of capitalists have augmented their already massive fortunes through these schemes, which involve Wall Street and imperialist institutions like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (see “Mexico’s Housing Debacle,” Los Angeles Times, 26 November 2017). At the bottom of society, due to extremely onerous mortgages, hundreds of thousands of working-class families have lost everything or are trapped in these unsanitary ghettos. Almost 150 years ago, Friedrich Engels, who together with Karl Marx founded scientific socialism, taught us that “the housing shortage is no accident; it is a necessary institution and it can be abolished together with all its effects on health, etc., only if the whole social order from which it springs is fundamentally refashioned” (The Housing Question, 1872).

Criminal Exploiters

The bourgeois media now speak of “solidarity” in an insulting campaign of flag-waving schmaltz. But the earthquakes showed, once again, the ineptitude, insatiable search for profit and disregard for human life and suffering on the part of the capitalist class, its state and its entire system. The 1985 earthquake brought to light the inhuman situation of industrial textile workers, especially women, when in the very center of the city almost 1,600 workers died. They were without a union, were paid miserable wages and were crammed into improvised workshops in rickety buildings packed with heavy machinery. Now, in the miserable Obrera neighborhood, a building collapsed that housed a dressmaking workshop and other businesses. To date, it’s not clear how many workers perished, given that in most cases textile workers lack any legal benefits, and thus there is no reliable count of the workforce.

The September 19 Seamstresses Union was born out of the 1985 catastrophe. Today it has been practically destroyed due to attacks by the government and the bourgeoisie. Mexican workers organizations have been the target of an incessant offensive by the bosses since the 1980s, in the face of which the bulk of the trade-union bureaucracies have simply ducked for cover. In 1985, unions like the SME electrical workers, which was destroyed in 2009 by the PAN’s [Felipe] Calderón, and the miners and steel workers mobilized to carry out rescue work. But this time the battered organizations of the working class were absent. The extensive solidarity that was displayed lacked the discipline, experience, skill and class content that only the workers movement could provide.

It is necessary to revitalize and strengthen the unions by organizing the masses of workers that do not have union representation. The existing union leaderships are without exception pro-capitalist bureaucracies that tie workers to one or another bourgeois party and inculcate in the working class the notion that the capitalist state is everlasting. To unchain the proletariat’s enormous social power, a struggle is needed to replace these bureaucracies with class-struggle leaderships committed to mobilizing the working class in the interest of all the exploited and oppressed.

Bourgeois State to the “Rescue”

With medical and rescue services overwhelmed, authorities asked the population for donations of everything from water, milk and tools to adrenaline. The shelters that were improvised were often unsanitary and exposed to inclement weather, especially in the countryside. At least a large part of the food and necessary supplies for the homeless came from the population. These donations were the object of innumerable cases of corruption by the government and bourgeois parties.

In this ever more militarized society, the government’s only plan when faced with disaster situations is the mass mobilization of the forces of the capitalist state (the army, the navy, the police); firemen, paramedics and other rescue services barely exist. While the military may have participated in rescue efforts, the overwhelming majority of soldiers and navy men do not have the slightest training for such tasks: their job is to repress. In fact, while there was no shortage of assault rifles, the detachments of soldiers lacked shovels, pickaxes and any basic tool for removing rubble in search of trapped survivors. The police, meanwhile, are the guard dogs of the bourgeoisie, plain and simple.

The bourgeois state is a machine of coercion directed against the exploited and oppressed at the service of the capitalists and their regime. In that vein, a central purpose of the state forces was to intimidate the population and protect private property from “looting,” i.e., desperate people procuring necessary consumables. The real looters are the capitalists, who squeeze out of the workers their very last drop of sweat and blood! Just as in 1985, the cuerpo de granaderos [riot police] soon cordoned off disaster areas to contain the indignation and rage of residents, who still did not know the fate of their relatives and friends when the government decided to end rescue efforts and bring in heavy machinery.

“Reconstruction” and Bourgeois Philanthropy

Oozing elitism, PRI president Peña Nieto, with Miguel Mancera of the PRD (head of the Mexico City government) at his side, announced with great fanfare that he would grant the capital’s homeless 3,000 pesos [approximately $160] a month to pay rent for up to three months—an amount barely enough to pay for a room. Owners of collapsed homes in the city will receive mortgage credits of up to two million pesos [$105,000] for 20 years at 9 percent annual interest. Those who lost everything, maybe even their families, can now acquire one more debt with the capitalist government and bloodsucking banks.

Peasants in Oaxaca and Chiapas were promised 120,000 pesos if their homes were destroyed and 15,000 if they only suffered “partial damage.” In Chiapas alone, almost 17,000 homes collapsed. The racist Peña Nieto sermonized that with the money, people should have enough to build “decent and dignified two-room” homes, as long as they don’t spend it on something else. This was an allusion to the vile stereotype of indigenous people spending all their money on alcohol.

Having promised 120,000 pesos, the cruel government reconsidered. Since a good number of homes still had a wall standing, such damage was in the end considered “partial.” So the government deducted 105,000 pesos from those affected. In any case, many of the homeless in the southeast have protested that they haven’t received a single peso, since they were given bankcards without funds.

The same builders who, hand-in-hand with the government, are centrally responsible for the tragedy will now make a killing from reconstruction, including of Catholic churches, which will be paid for out of public funds. However, in a display of Christian compunction, the “private initiative” (the bosses) donated four billion pesos, and the Vatican gave alms of $150,000 (not enough to rebuild even one of the lavish churches). That kind-hearted soul Carlos Slim [telecom magnate] “raised” 2.3 billion pesos, money that was “donated” basically by hundreds of thousands of people paying the monopolistic phone charges that allowed him to become one of the world’s richest men. Sweet philanthropy! As Engels wrote of the bourgeois philanthropic hypocrites in 19th-century England:

“As though you rendered the proletarians a service in first sucking out their very life-blood and then practicing your self-complacent, Pharisaic philanthropy upon them, placing yourselves before the world as mighty benefactors of humanity when you give back to the plundered victims the hundredth part of what belongs to them! Charity which degrades him who gives more than him who takes; charity which treads the downtrodden still deeper in the dust, which demands that the degraded, the pariah cast out by society, shall first surrender the last that remains to him, his very claim to manhood, shall first beg for mercy before your mercy deigns to press, in the shape of an alms, the brand of degradation upon his brow.”

—The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845)

No Illusions in the Capitalist Parties!

Now that the child has drowned, they want to cover the well. Facing popular pressure, [Andrés Manuel] López Obrador (AMLO) and his Morena promised to donate a little more than 100 million pesos for the homeless. The other capitalist parties will also donate part of the millions they get in subsidies to those affected by the earthquake, even though they, along with government authorities, had originally met the proposal with indignation. In the face of growing discontent, López Obrador wants to offer a little more carrot without easing up on the stick. AMLO is a bourgeois populist committed to the capitalist order—he and his Morena are no less enemies of proletarian victory than are the PRI, PAN and PRD.

AMLO bases his whole 2018 presidential campaign on rhetoric against the “corruption” of the “mafia in power.” But corruption is inevitable under capitalism. And don’t forget, it was successive PRD Mexico City governments—starting with López Obrador in 2000, when he was still in the PRD—that unleashed real estate speculation. Criminal corruption around permits and supervision of construction in the city occurred for the most part under its PRD governments, as well as borough administrations under Morena (in Cuauhtémoc, Tláhuac and Xochimilco) and the PAN (in Benito Juárez).

There is without a doubt disgust and anger at the capitalist rulers among the Mexican masses. After September 19, Secretary of the Interior Osorio Chong and municipal president Avelino Méndez Rangel of Morena confirmed this for themselves when they had to haul ass to save their hides from the fury of residents of Obrera and Xochimilco respectively. But what is missing is a class understanding. The masses’ miserable situation, as well as the rulers’ disdain for human welfare, are not the products of the policies of one or another party or individual, but rather are inevitable characteristics of the capitalist system based on private ownership of the means of production.

For a Workers and Peasants Government!

Half of this country is in an area of intense seismic activity, and practically the entire coastline is under the annual threat of hurricanes. In Mexico City, one of the most populous cities in the world, danger from earthquakes is increased by the fact that a large part of it is built on a lakebed. Scientific institutions as well as the government were fully aware that a new and potentially catastrophic earthquake was just a matter of time. Though earthquakes, like other natural phenomena, are unpredictable, technology exists that can give the population some advance warning, depending on the distance from the epicenter. But preventing disasters is far from capitalism’s priority. In this society everything, including science, is subordinated to the enrichment of a handful. The agency responsible for the famous (and most often inaudible) seismic alert system is a private entity, an obscure civil association called CIRES, that offers early-warning systems for more than 50,000 pesos. And Mexico City’s supposedly strict anti-earthquake construction standards are worth nothing when making money is involved.

Incapable of providing everyone with safety, health care, decent housing and employment, capitalism deserves to perish. Against the bourgeoisie’s speculation and fraud, in order to reconstruct disaster zones and tackle unemployment, we are for an extensive plan of public works and housing improvement under union control—let the workers themselves ensure the quality of materials and construction—and for a sliding scale of wages and work hours. A struggle for goals like these would light the way toward the necessary revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. A workers and peasants government—the dictatorship of the proletariat supported by the peasantry—would put science at the service of society, which would at least help minimize the effects of natural disasters.

Faced with rural misery, workers are forced to cram into cities in search of some way to survive, living in rooms as dismal as they are expensive and often lacking basic services. As a basic and immediate way to begin solving the housing problem, a workers state would expropriate the opulent residences of the possessing classes and open them to workers who are homeless or in overcrowded housing. We communists work to see the day when the true producers of society’s wealth occupy the mansions and luxury apartments of the Polanco and Las Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhoods…and the presidential residence at Los Pinos!

Workers and peasants in power would fight to overcome the contradiction between the city and the countryside. Such a regime would seek to eliminate ancestral rural backwardness by bringing all of modern society’s advances to the countryside: decent, comfortable housing; roads; schools; telecommunications; industry and scientific agriculture; etc. As a result, a huge, chaotic, overpopulated, dirty, polluted city like Mexico City, which is sinking and collapsing, could gradually be eliminated.

This perspective is not realizable without the international extension of the revolution, especially to advanced countries like the U.S. and other powers, which would put enormous resources inherited from imperialist capitalism at the service of the world’s vast dispossessed and oppressed masses. It is necessary to forge Leninist-Trotskyist parties, following the example and experience of the Bolsheviks who brought the Russian workers and peasants to power in 1917. Such parties would fight for socialist revolutions internationally to destroy capitalism and set the foundations for a new society, where those who labor rule, on the basis of the collectivization of the means of production. Humanity’s struggle against blind nature requires the expropriation of the capitalist expropriators and the establishment of an international planned economy dedicated to satisfying human needs.

People used to have lands, businesses, but they lost everything due to privatisation and collectivism. In the 70-80, we were prosperous after we contracted loans from international banks, but the communist leader Ceausescu visited China and liked what he saw. He wanted to be idolised, he wanted big parades in his honour, his picture in every classroom, in every office. But suddenly he didn’t want to “be a slave” for world banks, so he wanted to pay all the debts. He managed to do so, by cutting out how water in households (not only for washing, but for heating also), people were starving because there was literally nothing to eat other than the “ratio” you were provided. 
How is everything now? Horrible. Our grandparents miss that period, because they had job security (nevermind the fact that no matter how safe your job was, there was basically nothing you could do with money). People still expect the government to do everything for them, because that how it was. You finished high school and were given a job, an apartment and vacation, people still expect that, there is little entrepreneurial spirit in my country, people are lazy, they are happy to just live another day, to live pay check to pay check, there is no pursuit for something greater.

If you aren't happy with your job, you can leave for a higher paying job, or bargain for higher wages with them. It is supply and demand. What the anti work movement supporters might not understand is that strikes and unionizing isn't anti-capitalist, it's actually the reason that capitalism thrives.

The only downside is that it takes a little more time than forcing everyone to conform with a new rule or law enforced by the government.

Did I Overreact to this sexist remark?,Liberal,6,ksv21l,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ksv21l/did_i_overreact_to_this_sexist_remark/,6,"I need some help understanding an encounter I just had with my brother. He is generally not very empathetic toward women's issues or the goals of feminism, and at one time we were both entrenched in the conservative movement, which led to us forming the opinion that third wave feminism was pointless man-hating. We haven't been in that movement for quite some time, now (it was just a rebellious phase against the largely liberal culture we grew up in), but it sometimes influences the way I perceive his comments. Since then, I've become much more involved in the movement for gender equality. This started when I came out and began diving into the ligbtq+ community, which generally supports racial and gender equality. This encouraged my interest in feminism, to which I'm fairly new. So I wanted to post the interaction here to ask if I'm overreacting. 
 
My brother showed me a picture of a fairly unattractive man and said ""if he slapped your girl's ass, would you beat him?"" I said ""if he slapped MY ass, I'd call the police bc it's completely unacceptable to touch a woman like that without consent"" and he said ""it's a meme, Meg"" as if I was sucking the fun out of a joke by pointing out that it perpetuates rape culture and degrades women. (I emphasized that ""MY"" because I don't think the situation should be framed from the perspective of the woman's partner. It implies that she is their property and therefore the crime has really been committed against THEM, not her. It also suggests that she needs her partner to do something because she can't handle the situation herself even though she is the one who has been sexually assaulted.) 

Meme or not, I didn't think this was an okay thing to say. 

Keep in mind that we share a love for dark/edgy humor when it's done well, and there has never been any truth in the racist, sexist, or homophopic jokes we would tell. We're both of the mind that such jokes are best used when the intention is to show the ridiculousness of those beliefs. (Example: Making a joke about how black people are criminals points out the ridiculousness of that stereotype and ultimately makes racists, not black people.) However, I don't think this particular ""joke"" does that. The sexism of it is not the part that is supposed to be funny. The part that is supposed to be funny is that the man is not attractive. The sexism and perpetuation of rape culture lies in the setup, not the punchline. Which makes me feel like pointing it out is important because the person making the joke may not have even realized that it had these undertones. Do you think I'm overreacting or do you think the joke was inappropriate? Please give your honest opinion, I'm not afraid to be wrong.",1610079986.0

For market socialists and soc dems. This is a follow up on a previous post about absentee ownership. Would love input,Liberal,25,rrb1y4,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rrb1y4/for_market_socialists_and_soc_dems_this_is_a/,2,"Hi all,

I was the guy who posted about absentee ownership the other day. There were some genuinely interesting replies to that post that got me thinking a bit.

Now I am kinda having an internal debate and would love some help resolving it.

So, on the one had we have my original argument:

Absentee ownership is effectively a massive government intervention in the market economy. This is because the real service of an investor is two fold, bearing costs and providing capital. Why do workers need an investor? Usually it is because they don't have the capital themselves. In theory they could work and work and save and save for years, but nobody wants to do that. So they turn to an investor for help. They want the investor to bear the costs of providing capital. In exchange the investor asks for some form of payment for their services. After all, bearing costs and providing capital is a genuinely useful service. So the workers (including entepeneur and all that) agree. Now, the way a normal service is paid for is that you pay for the new goods once they are delivered. However, with absentee ownership of a company (in the form of equity or stocks) means that payment continues well after the investor was recouped for the costs and paid for their services (i.e. the total cost (including opportunity cost)).

The only reason that the workers have to keep paying is because if they stopped payments to the investor then the state would step in and it would be considered stealing from shareholders right? That means absentee ownership is enforced with an underlying threat of force, keep paying or you will be arrested. And thus this amounts to state interference in the market.

Once the costs (including opportunity) have been beared and the capital provided, why should the investor still be paid? Their services were compensated. Absentee ownership is basically paying for a service no longer provided all back with state enforcement.


On the other hand,

Absentee ownership is basically a contract. You don't actually have to sign the contract. You are perfectly free to get a loan in the current system.

But again, how do those loans work?

Most loans are collateralized. And that means that you basically have the same issue right? Absentee ownership of collateral should the loan fall through. Cause like, we the workers could keep working on the collateral goods but then we would get arrested. Though in fairness good luck ever getting a loan again if you don't give up said collateral.... 

Uncollateralized loans are also an issue primarily because of the expense

Then there are times when loans and bonds aren't right for a situation. I'd be ok with like a time limited stock, I understand that proffered stock can be used this way but I don't totally get the mechanism for it, market socialists here I would love an explanation if you understand how exactly a preferred stock could act like time limited stock (I hear it was about a redemption clause or something? I will link the comment where I read that below)



So what do you think?

Basically I am deciding between two systems here, one in which firms are split in ownership between capital and labor where the value of each is represented I ownership % or one in which labor owns the whole firm and time limited stock and/or loans are used for finance. The devil is in the details and those are what I trying to work out


Would love input

* **“It  is expressly excluded from the purpose of this legal person for this  legal person to spend its operating funds with the intention to  influence or affect the outcome of any electoral, lawmaking or  rulemaking process of the United States or any state, territory or  tribe, including but not limited to such processes by administrations,  counties, cities or other subdivisions or delegations of the United  States or any state thereof. This express exclusion overrides any  contrary language within this document.”**
* **“In  the event that the express exclusion of the preceding paragraph is  found to be unenforceable, then all activities including the ownership  of property and the right to sue, but not including the ability to be  sued, are expressly excluded from the purpose of this legal person. In  the event that the exclusion of this paragraph is activated, no person  shall be shielded from liability by this legal person.”**
* (b)  All persons applying for the creation of any such legal person are  officially on notice of these provisions as of the date this law comes  into effect, and any charter, articles or incorporation or other  creating documents issued after that date which do not contain the above  language shall be treated at law as if they did contain this language.  Any authority who fails to include this language in such creating  documents is subject to mandamus in federal court.
* (c)  In the event that subsections (a) and/or (b) of this section are  judicially found to be facially unenforceable, then All U.S. States, and  all authorities delegated by the U.S. or any state, territory or tribe  of the U.S. with the authority under law to create legal persons are  hereby prohibited from creating any such legal persons from the date  such judicial findings become mandatory precedent to such state(s)  and/or delegated authority(ies). This subsection shall be interpreted to  extend exactly and only within the full extent of the constitutional  powers of the federal government of the United States.
* (d)  all existing laws whether state or federal which conflict with  subsections (a), (b) or (c) are hereby repealed to the extent that they  so contradict those subsections.

**Why does it work?**

Since  the Civil War, the United States has moved from a position in which  corporations required specific purpose statements in their charters to  allowing no specific purpose. This means that you can make corporations  that do anything. Before general purpose corporations, corporations that  did things that were not listed on their purpose statements could be  hauled into court under a doctrine called *ultra vires*.  Essentially, it was an argument that they had gone beyond the  limitations of the legal privilege of incorporation the government had  given them. Now that very few people use anything other than general  purpose corporations, the doctrine of *ultra vires* has all but died out for corporations.

But  if this language were written into the charter of a corporation, and it  then tried to influence an electoral process, the doctrine of *ultra vires*  would again apply, allowing the government, or in some cases,  shareholders, to sue the company for injunctive relief to prevent it  from undertaking the *ultra vires* action of attempting to influence elections.

**What about Freedom of Speech?**

The resulting lawsuits based on *ultra vires*  would not be founded on any federal law which restricted speech.  Rather, the lawsuit would operate based on the charter itself.  No one  would deny that it is the right of the government to control the terms  on which it issues charters, and no one would deny it is the power of a  charter to control the actions of a corporation. Effectively, this law  is simply the government saying that it chooses not to grant the right  of limited liability to anyone who would use it for this purpose.

*Citizens United*  is about the constitutional rights of corporations to speak. Since the  law in that case was a content-based discrimination, the law failed, but  this law does not actually restrict the rights of corporations to  speak. This law restricts the rights of incorporators to create  corporations for the purpose of speaking. Although a corporation may  only be able to speak by its financial maneuvers, incorporators are  completely free to speak through other means, so my estimation is that  this statute amounts to what’s called a time, place and manner  restriction rather than a content-based discrimination of speech. Even  if I’m wrong about that, I think the government-as-speaker exception  would arguably still apply.

There  is a small chance that the express exclusion in question might be held  unenforceable since a court might still find it to be a content-based  discrimination, but if that happens, the second paragraph (the suicide  exclusion) introduces a new exclusion which is not a content-based  discrimination and which effectively paralyzes the corporation from  doing anything at all. There is no doubt that this second section is  constitutional, and messing with it would be like disarming a very  touchy landmine for any corporate lawyer. And just in case they disarm  it too well, it tanks the entire corporate reproductive system  altogether. My guess is, nobody even tries to disarm it, and if they do,  no judge would be stupid enough to actually do it.

**What about a constitutional amendment?**

How’s that been going lately?

**What about staffing the courts with more liberal justices?**

If  somebody is willing to pack the court, I’m all for it, but nobody seems  down, so I thought I’d suggest we try this instead. Even if you were to  pull it off, it’s hard to know in advance they would actually overturn *Citizens United*.  The right case would have to come along, and they really couldn’t  promise to do so before or be held to any promises to do so later. It  becomes a game of personality politics. Iffy.

**Won’t the same lobbyists who have been running the show so far stop it from passage?**

Maybe,  but what’s nice about it is that it does not apply to the clients of  any of those lobbyists. Those lobbyists all represent existing  corporations, not new ones. Existing corporations can be told that  they’re about to get an extremely valuable permanent market advantage.  We can always have government lawyers hunt them down, find some evidence  of crime and revoke their charters if they get in the way later. Once  we get control of the political process again, putting the government’s  best and brightest lawyers and accountants on the job of nailing  multi-billion-dollar corporations to the wall should be reasonably  doable. One step at a time. First, we cut their balls off. Then we worry  about what’s left of them.

**But wouldn’t this hurt my favorite charity/think-tank/union/happy puppy farm?**

Not  much in my opinion. This law doesn’t prohibit governments from  recognizing organizations. It prohibits governments from creating  organizations. Partnerships are part of the common law and would be  unaffected. Creating organizations for purposes of lawsuits would be  unaffected since those are recognized in court, not created by  legislative power. What would be altered would simply be limited  liability of those organizations, which, if they’re not doing anything  sketchy, they probably don’t really need anyway. I mean, if your  favorite organization is trying to funnel dark money into electoral  politics, then maybe you should pick a new favorite organization, but if  you want to politically participate, this shouldn’t be a problem. Even  if you’re part of an organization that likes to keep its members secret,  what protections for that secrecy that do exist at law are not really  connected to the question of whether those organizations are recognized  as corporations.

Also, remember  this only affects new corporations, so unless your particular favorite  organization likes to make new corporations for some reason, it  shouldn’t make much difference. Even if (c) ends up triggering a  meltdown of the entire corporate reproduction system, the benefits lost  are mostly to investors who blow up chemical plants. Your puppy farm  probably doesn’t really need a lot of limitations of liability anyway.  At the very least, we’d be doing a Hell of a lot more damage to our  enemies than our friends.

**But what if (c) is triggered, and the nation needs a corporation for some reason?**

Don’t  know why it would, but there’s nothing in this law that would prevent  the federal congress from creating a new federal corporation the  old-fashioned way. Indeed, there never could be such a statute since  Congress has that implied power under the constitution. Furthermore, in  the unlikely event that (c) is triggered, I’d expect a clamor of federal  lawmakers rushing in to renegotiate a new deal based on whatever  judicial language ended up triggering it. They wouldn’t just leave it  unattended if it actually went off. That would be a moment of  revolutionary potential indeed.

**Could (c) be attacked on the grounds that it violates states' rights?**

I  think that's a long shot argument since it doesn't actually prohibit  the states from doing anything. It just prohibits them from  creating  organizations for the purpose of doing things, but in the event that I'm  wrong, the last sentence in (c) is there to minimize the damage any  kind of 10th Amendment argument might do. No one would argue that the  creation of corporations does not affect interstate commerce, so we're  definitely within areas of traditional federal power.

**Well,  if we’re going to be this radical, why do we have to stop with the  creation of new corporations? Can’t we go after the existing ones too?**

The  trouble there is that the corporations that already exist are going to  be harder to tackle with a statute. They’re already dug in and have been  found to have constitutional rights. We’ll have to take their  constitutional rights the same way we take everybody else’s away: make  up stupid laws and convict them of crimes. Or we could just tax them  until they go broke, but that’s all for after we’ve got enough control  over our own lawmaking processes that we can actually get the job done.

The  ability of these corporations to reproduce is critical to the way that  they control the government. If that’s stopped, then any existing  corporation playing the Super-PAC game can be exposed and the harm it  can do can be limited. From there, we can get enough control to finish  them off.

**Why has nobody suggested this before?**

Beats  me. I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. If you have a  suggestion to make it a better, or a reason it won’t work, let’s hear  it.",1643364599.0

[3-CC7-D33-E-5061-4-E7-D-ABE8-1-A79-A7-D1-D5-CF.jpg](https://postimg.cc/HJN7rWcy)


Image description: a picture of a page with a highlighted passage (“But it is above and beyond all sexual specification that the existent seeks self-justification in the movement of his transcendence: *the very submission of women proves this*.”)  from the Borde/ Malovany-Chevallier translation of The Second Sex, which reads:  

...supreme value for man but that it must serve ends far greater than itself. The worst curse on woman is her exclusion from warrior expeditions; it is not in giving life but in risking his life that man raises himself above the animal; this is why throughout humanity, superiority has been granted not to the sex that gives birth but to the one that kills. 

Here we hold the key to the whole mystery. On a biological level, a species maintains itself only by re-creating itself; but this creation is nothing but a repetition of the same Life in different forms. By transcending Life through Existence, man guarantees the repetition of Life: by this surpassing, he creates values that deny any value to pure repetition. With an animal, the gramitousness and variety of male activities are useless because no project is involved; what it does is worthless when it is not serving the species; but in serving the species, the human male shapes the face of the earth, creates new instruments, invents and forges the future. Positing himself as sovereign, he encounters the complicity of woman herself: because she herself is also an existent, because transcendence also inhabits her and her project is not repetition but surpassing herself toward another future; she finds the confirmation of masculine claims in the core of her being. She participates with men in festivals that celebrate the success and victories of males. Her misfortune is to have been biologically destined to repeat Life, while in her own eyes Life in itself does not provide her reasons for being, and these reasons are more important than life itself. 

Certain passages where Hegel's dialectic describes the relationship of master to slave would apply far better to the relationship of man to woman. The Master's privilege, he states, arises from the affirmation of Spirit over Life in the fact of risking his life: but in fact the vanquished slave has exoerienced this same risk, whereas the woman is originally an existent who gives Life and does not risk her life; there has never been combat between the male and her; Hegel's definition applies singularly to her. ""The other [consciousness] is the dependent consciousness for which essential reality is animal life, that is, life given by another entity."" But this relationship differs from the relationship of oppression because woman herself aspires to and recognizes the values concretely attained by males. It is the male who opens up the future toward which she also transcends; in reality, women have never pitted female values against male ones: it is men wanting to maintain masculine prerogatives who invented this division; they wanted to create a feminine domain— a rule of life, of immanence— only to lock woman in it. But it is above and beyond all sexual specification that the existent seeks self-justification in the movement of his transcendence: (start highlighted text) the very submission of women proves this.

They don't ask basic ass questions like what will the money be for, how much money will be generated. Who will control this money.

This is your Typical left wing statist mentality: ""If some group of people are doing better they need to be brought down through taxation and regulation in order for people to be more equal."" Thats why a lot of progressives believe in high taxes. because some people are making too much and things need to be more ""fair"".

Your typical statist doesn't care that the government uses force through the threat of coercion to take people's money. Your typical statist believes everything the government does is legitimate. And if something is wrong with the government. Well thats just white supremacy and dont worry, putting more people of color and being more woke will fix that shit right away! 

This is why and how the government is able to get away with passing trillion dollar stimulus bills that don't really do anything except make people of special interest richer while making all of us poorer through inflation. This is why the government is able to pass tens of thousands of new laws and regulations every year. Why every year we have a bigger government and a little be less liberty. All while you have Far left Statist screaming that we need more regulations and higher taxes.

This is why democracy is a BS dangerous ideology. If we had global democracy billions of people from the third world would vote for a all powerful totalitarian socialist government to take control of everything and redistribute all wealth and destroy all capitalism. 

This is why democrats in the US are flooding the country with illegals. They know most immigrants will vote for a bigger government that promises more welfare on every election cycle. Plus a poor dumb population that is too busy working long hours is easier to control so it makes sense for them.

The first story hinted at the capitalist lie that anyone could suddenly become rich.

I found it significant that in the second story, the developer and all the potential tenants are rats — themselves a pest species.

The third story had the most overt leftist themes for me. The protagonist Rosa is a landlord, the leftist's villain. She insists on getting paid rent so she can fix up the house, but whom does she intend to pay to fix things? She clearly doesn't know how to do it herself, and until Cosmos arrives unexpectedly, there's no-one around who does. She's hanging on to her property well beyond the point where doing so has any value — the planet has flooded! — and is unwilling to abandon her old ideas and look for something better. The fact that she gets to keep the house in the end even while striking out seems to be saying, ""Hey skeptics, communists don't actually want to take your toothbrushes. You get to keep things you own. You just have to change how you think about what that means.""",1642672817.0

>Let me ask you this and answer honestly: You have $500. You can spend it on hiring the kid next door to mow your lawn for $20 for a third of the year, or you can mow your own lawn spend it on a new game console. Which would you choose?

>We'll use the same scenario to answer your question about how the 1% enforces their wealth. Say you choose to hire the kid next door. You agree he will mow your lawn for a third of the year. He say he needs it to fund his dog's operation. He mows your lawn, and you pay him $20. You then decide you'd rather have a new console and can mow your lawn yourself. You can choose from multiple options: [1] you can nullify the agreement and be the neighborhood jerk, [2] you can tell him you'll lower down his pay to $10, [3] you can tell him you'll give him the $20 but he has to buy the gas for the mower himself from that $20, or [4] you can tell him to fuck off your lawn or you'll shoot him and gis dog with your shotgun.

My reply:

>If you have limited funds and you're set on reducing your lawn service costs, there are a few other options you missed. You can't present a complex set of solutions without covering all of them!

>* You can go to his competitor and offer $15 or however little amount he is willing to take. 
* Another option is you let your grass grow and just don't cut it, this is the cheapest route immediately since you don't even need gas or a mower for it, but could have long term costs. 
* You could salt/herbacide the yard and nothing would grow there, this would cost less than $20 and only have to be done once.
* You could let the grass grow and then try to light it on fire, probably not a good idea, but it's one way to handle it.
* You could start a service where you take care of people's goats and allow the goats to eat the grass. Thus earning yourself additional profit and solving the grass problem.
* You could let the grass grow full length and then cut it into hay, bail it, and then sell it for a profit. You could even pay the kid next door to do all this and break even without having to exert yourself much at all. This way you keep your existing money, the kid next door earns money, and someone gets hay for their animals or whatever.

>**Thank you for emphasizing a very important point. You only presented 4 options. And that is very much what the free market is like under government regulation. My solutions wouldn't have even been possible despite me coming up with a much better solution as my answer than if I had followed the government's rules and chose 1 of the 4.**

""The Soviet Union is proof socialism will never work!"" ""People starved under socialism!"" ""Venezuela and Cuba are socialist hellholes!"" etc, yet they ignore the issues and present/current problems under capitalism.

1. For the ""**People starved under socialism!**"" point, the world’s farmers produce enough food to feed 1.5x the global population. That’s enough to feed **10 billion** (we are at 7.6 billion currently). Despite this excess, hunger still exists. Today, 795 million people are hungry. [Another 2 billion are expected to join them by 2050](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/). Our inability to feed the entirety of the world’s population is mostly due to food waste. [Globally, 30–40% of all food is wasted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41173771_Food_Security_The_Challenge_of_Feeding_9_Billion_People). In less developed countries, this waste is due to lack of infrastructure and knowledge to keep food fresh. For example, India loses 30–40% of its produce because retail and wholesalers lack cold storage. In more developed countries, the lower relative cost of food reduces the incentive to waste. And as portion size grows, more and more food gets thrown out and wasted. Our food distribution system is inefficient. But this inefficiency won’t drive 2 billion more people into hunger by 2050. This is under capitalism. ( [We produce enough food to feed 10 billion people.

2. For the ""**The Soviet Union is proof socialism will never work!**"" point, even though the Soviet Union was one of the most repressive and deadly regimes in history, and many outright atrocities were committed against the Soviet people through the years. But even the worst governments may do something right. For the Soviet Union, most of these things were a huge contradiction to other Soviet policies.

The Soviet Union was ahead of the West in women’s rights. Although many of their rights were given out of necessity, Soviet women had [more opportunity in employment](http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/moderneurope/molly-wolanski/) and politics than Western women for most of the 20th century. By law, women in the Soviet Union had the same employment opportunities as men and tended to work in jobs that Western women couldn’t. However, that was a double-edged sword because Soviet culture also demanded that women take care of housekeeping after their day jobs. As a result, women spent more time working than men.

Shockingly, the Soviet Union encouraged tourism within its borders. By law, workers got two weeks off from work every year and were given vouchers to travel to certain tourist destinations, including Sochi. Vouchers to Sochi were given either in the winter or the summer. The use of free vacations played a practical role for Soviet leaders. First, it was an attempt to ensure loyalty by giving people some positive impressions about the government. Second, it gave the Soviet people a feeling of independence and empowerment, which was sorely missing from other aspects of their lives. Third, it allowed workers to rest and recover from their jobs, which was meant to [ensure peak production](https://books.google.com/books?id=5m_bcKBMMKkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=soviet+union+free+vacations&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibtb_w-LbKAhVQ72MKHYw3CVgQ6AEILzAA#v=onepage&q=%20free%20vacations&f=false) when they returned to work. New mothers also received [free maternity leave](https://books.google.com/books?id=vJJaBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA167&dq=soviet+union+free+vacations&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb2tf3-LbKAhUD2mMKHShNBw84ChDoAQg2MAI#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20free%20vacations&f=false) as part of the Soviet health insurance system. This allowed mothers to take time off with their babies while having access to necessary medical care.

In 1920, the Soviet Union became the first country in Europe to completely legalize abortions for women. It was not until 1936 that another European country caught up to the Soviet Union. That was the year that [Iceland legalized abortions](https://books.google.com/books?id=EBmIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&dq=soviet+union+abortion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpqLTf0OvKAhUB7mMKHbESAHcQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20abortion&f=false). Like many things in the Soviet Union, reproductive rights suffered during the Stalin era. Concerned with low population growth, Stalin outlawed abortions in 1936, just as Iceland was legalizing them. In 1955, Soviet women were permitted to have abortions again. At the time, this was a limited right, only applying in cases where the mother’s life was in jeopardy. Later, universal reproductive rights were reestablished. Soviet abortion policy was seen as following [Leninist ideologies](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2060137?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), which promoted the idea that a woman should not be forced to have an unwanted baby. Over time, [abortions became increasingly commonplace](https://books.google.com/books?id=HOl-SqBouGIC&pg=PA203&dq=soviet+union+abortion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpqLTf0OvKAhUB7mMKHbESAHcQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20abortion&f=false) in the Soviet Union, with most women having at least one during their lifetimes. Still, the Soviet Union was at the forefront of reproductive rights legislation in Europe.

For a country that had huge issues with environmental contamination, the Soviet Union and its puppet states had a large-scale recycling program for their citizens. In the 1970s, Soviet leaders began to set up recycling services that were extensive for the time, even if most people took a while to use them. Twenty Soviet cities had major [recycling plants for paper](https://books.google.com/books?id=s84zAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=soviet+union+recycling+program&source=bl&ots=wcck932IXA&sig=7CvA2sQ78cl7UltCEb138aZQjyc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj98-200-vKAhVY0mMKHWPDDgMQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20recycling%20program&f=false), with almost 30 percent of all paper recycled in the Soviet Union during the 1980s. Compared to the 270 kilograms (600 lb) of paper used by Americans per capita in 1989, people in the former Soviet Union only used about 10 kilograms (25 lb) per capita that year. This was partly due to the [Soviet culture of reusing material](https://books.google.com/books?id=8eI7zhLGHlYC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=soviet+union+glass+recycling+program&source=bl&ots=epKWApfOBt&sig=i8TzVM9DL4v6AxphDc1gBDHyRXg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFiLPK0-vKAhUW7WMKHW2wCUsQ6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&q=soviet%20union%20glass%20recycling%20program&f=false). Soviet citizens also had access to glass recycling centers that sometimes paid them to return glass bottles. During the Soviet regime, [plastic was rarely used](http://understandrussia.com/packaging/) in consumer goods. Plastic bags did not appear until the 1980s. For most of the Soviet years, people reused their bags or used their own containers when shopping for food. Plastic bottles were also uncommon, with most bottles made of glass and easily recyclable. This reduced the amount of waste produced by the average citizen and compared favorably to other industrial countries.

Before the rise of the Soviet Union, Russia was mostly an agrarian country that did not have an effective industrial economy. In this way, it lagged far behind other countries in Europe. However, one of the most important things that the Soviet regime did for its country was to bring it into the modern world. During the [Stalin era](http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/8/stalin-and-the-drive-to-industrialize-the-soviet-union?ab=X63-3&utm_expid=22625156-1.jO__KIIlQVuEPc9uLGsmiQ.1), the Soviet Union underwent a massive industrialization process. The minor economy of the tsarist era was transformed into an industrial powerhouse that rivaled other first-world countries. All of this happened in the 10-year period from 1928 to 1938. Overall, the Soviet Union [industrialized at a faster rate](http://ibatpv.org/projects/soviet_union/collectivization%20and%20industrialization.htm) than any other country previously had, which improved the lifestyles of its citizens. Between 1929 and 1934, the Soviet Union achieved a 50 percent increase in industrial growth and an average annual growth rate of 18 percent, which was an unprecedented leap in output. Of course, the news wasn’t all good. Many products manufactured in the Soviet Union were of low quality. But industrialization helped the USSR to become a first-world country. Former Soviet states like Russia and Ukraine became effective world economies.

The Soviet Union emphasized education, especially in [science and engineering](https://books.google.com/books?id=XbeazCBcp3EC&pg=PA188&dq=free+education+in+soviet+union&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivgt2wkLzKAhVL8mMKHaeuD9gQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=free%20education%20in%20soviet%20union&f=false). Soviet law guaranteed all citizens a free education regardless of their social standing or income. Unlike other countries at the time, this education extended to college and postgraduate work. Some people received their doctorates without paying tuition. The education plan [covered all costs](https://books.google.com/books?id=rIsj8I4Zw6oC&pg=PA219&dq=free+education+in+soviet+union&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivgt2wkLzKAhVL8mMKHaeuD9gQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&q=free%20education%20in%20soviet%20union&f=false) of attending school, including textbooks and school supplies. The Soviets also [built universities](http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/archive/anglosov.htm) and extended the possibility of education to developing republics in the USSR where education had previously been unavailable. For example, Belarus had no universities before the Soviet Union existed. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Belarus had 22 universities. The effectiveness of the Soviet education system is clear from the number of [great scientists and mathematicians](http://www.sras.org/science_in_russia_and_the_soviet_union) that came out of the country.

Throughout its history, the Soviet Union had strict drug control, which became more repressive over time. This was the opposite of the trends in the West. Soviet policies focused on criminalization of drug use and did not do much with drug rehabilitation or addiction recovery. But it did result in essentially drug-free neighborhoods. Of course, there were still drug users in the Soviet Union. But their number was incredibly small, mainly confined to elitists and people in prison. Both groups [got their drugs from gypsies](http://www.angelfire.com/linux/vorlin/) who smuggled them into the country.

3. For the ""**Cuba is a socialist hellhole!**"" point, lets start with Cuba first.

Cuba provides free health care for its people. As a result, [life expectancy](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&hl=en&dl=en&idim=country:CUB:USA:CAN) for Cubans (79.13 years) is higher than for Americans (78.64 years).

* There are 23 medical schools on the island, meaning Cuba has the [highest doctor-to-resident ratio](http://www.socialmedicine.org/2012/07/30/about/cuba-leads-the-world-in-lowest-patient-per-doctor-ratio-how-do-they-do-it/) in the world (1:155).
* Skilled Cuban doctors are sent to countries [where they are needed](https://theconversation.com/by-sending-doctors-to-italy-cuba-continues-its-long-campaign-of-medical-diplomacy-134429), such as Italy, El Salvador, Haiti, Venezuela, and even the US.
* Cuba spends 10% of its entire national budget on [education](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html). As a result, education is free for the whole population at all levels of advancement (including university tuition). School uniforms and meals are also free.
* The Cuban literacy rate for over 15's is 99.8%. This is higher than in America (99.0%).
* The constitution guarantees Cubans the right to recall their politicians. If they want their leaders out, they can vote them out.

Its funny how capitalists bring up Venezuela also in this arguement. Such a weak talking point.. The fact that you **have** to compare the US to Venezuela really shows how you have to compare the US to a country like that to try and make the US look better.

So overall, before you fully demonize socialism and say it ""never worked"", take a good look at the downsides of capitalism.

Would laws preventing employer union busting efforts and maximizing employee bargaining power lead to greater union density?,Liberal,39,qo5yqb,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qo5yqb/would_laws_preventing_employer_union_busting/,15,"Consider the following reforms:

- ban employers from smear campaigns and union busting
- Allow the labour relations board to fine employers for labour law violations, and provide compensation to all employees affected by said violations.
- Allow the relevant union to organize economic sectors and legalize sector wide strikes.
- Mandate that employers provide a minimum number of paid hours per week for unions to meet with employees.
- Uphold and strengthen legislation requiring all employees covered by a collective agreement to financially support the union to at least the extent union members do.
- Independent contractors should be covered by all the rights guaranteed to regular employees.
- Employers would be banned from replacing striking workers with non-union labour.
- In the case that impasses are reached, unions could seek independent arbitration from the labour relations board who would offer final offer arbitration.
- guaranteed minimum income acting (de facto state funded strike pay).

These reforms would limit the ability of corporations to engage in union busting, as well as maximize unions bargaining power relative to employers. My concern is that none of this guarantees that unions would actually go out and organize workplaces and that the average worker would actually be interested in joining a union. Most workers seem to lack the sense that they actually need more bargaining power.",1636222566.0

From Facebook to Policebook (Boston Indie) 2 Feb 2018,Liberal,3,7yyn8b,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/7yyn8b/from_facebook_to_policebook_boston_indie_2_feb/,1,"From Facebook to Policebook 2 February 2018

On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a notice outlining extraordinary plans by the social media company to monitor all the postings and messages of its users, censor independent journalism, and use artificial intelligence (AI) to report users to the police and intelligence agencies.

Zuckerberg began his post, released in conjunction with the company's quarterly earnings report, by declaring that 2017 was a ""hard year"" for Facebook. ""The world feels anxious and divided--and that played out on Facebook. We've seen abuse on our platform, including interference from nation states, the spread of news that is false, sensational and polarizing, and debate about the utility of social media."" Facebook, he writes, has the responsibility to ""amplify the good and prevent harm. That is my personal challenge for 2018.""

In Facebook's ""newspeak,"" this means that the company will act aggressively this year to suppress the spread of information online and censor content, under the guise of combatting ""fake news"" and ""Russian meddling.""

The truly ominous implications of this project are outlined in Zuckerberg's post. Among Facebook's initiatives, he writes, is ""new technology to detect suicidal posts that has helped first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly, and we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real time and remove terrorist content.""

In other words, Facebook has introduced AI systems to collect, monitor and interpret all the information posted on its social media platform. As always, the introduction of such a sweeping system of mass surveillance is justified with seemingly praiseworthy motivations. After all, who could object to measures aimed at stopping suicides or terrorist attacks? The actual purpose of the new systems, however, is very different.

Zuckerberg points to the sweeping scope of the company's artificial intelligence plans later: ""Our goal with AI is to understand the meaning of all the content on Facebook."" Every single post, photo, video, message, comment, reaction and share will be fed into the company's increasingly powerful computer systems to be analyzed for ""harmful"" content, and reported to the police and intelligence agencies as deemed necessary.

The real--and sinister--aim of Facebook's actions is also made clear by the other initiatives that the company is taking. Most significantly, Zuckerberg stressed the company's determination to make sure that ""the information you see on Facebook comes from broadly trusted and high-quality sources, in order to counter misinformation and polarization.""

What are these ""broadly trusted"" sources? ""For example, take the Wall Street Journal or New York Times,"" wrote the multibillionaire CEO. ""Even if you don't read them or don't agree with everything they write, most people have confidence that they're high quality journalism. On the flip side, there are blogs that have intense followings but are not widely trusted beyond their core audience. We will show those publications somewhat less.""

In other words, corporate media sources will be promoted, while other publications, even those that ""have intense followings,"" will be demoted. As for being ""shown somewhat less,"" what Zuckerberg means is that they will be blocked from reaching a broader audience. More simply, they will be censored.

In addition to censoring news from alternative sources, Zuckerberg states at the beginning of his post that Facebook is working to ""show fewer viral videos"" because such content is not ""good for people's well-being and for society.""

The viral videos Zuckerberg is referring to include footage of police violence, social exposures like reporting on last year's Grenfell Tower inferno that exposed social inequality in London, and documentation of the war crimes carried out by the US military. Any such content will be ""demoted,"" which Zuckerberg later notes ""reduces an article's traffic by 80 percent.""

Zuckerberg's central pretense--that Facebook will promote sources that ""people have confidence"" in--is a fraud. In fact, according to a Gallup poll published last year, Americans' trust in the mass media ""to report the news fully, accurately and fairly"" reached its lowest level in poling history, with only 32 percent of participants saying they have a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of trust. At the same time, the use of social media to read news has been growing exponentially, reaching two-thirds of the US population according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.

The growth in the popularity of Facebook and other social media networks was in large measure due to the fact that they allowed their users access to information and viewpoints unavailable through mainstream media outlets. Now, Facebook has reversed course and declared that its intention is to promote the official narrative and block independent news sources that question it.

Facebook, Google, Twitter and other giant social media companies--working closely with intelligence agencies and governments--are seeking to leverage their role as mechanisms of communication to become instruments of censorship and repression. In the process, they are turning one of the most important and liberating technological advances of the 21st century, the growth and expansion of artificial intelligence, into a mechanism for police control and dictatorship.

The fight against Internet censorship is an urgent task facing workers all over the world. The World Socialist Web Site is leading the fight against the greatest threat to free speech since the Second World War. On January 23, it published an open letter calling for an international coalition of socialist, antiwar, left-wing and progressive websites, organizations and activists to fight Internet censorship.

The principles for this coalition are:

• Safeguarding the Internet as a platform for political organization and the free exchange of information, culture and diverse viewpoints, guided by the principle that access to the Internet is a right and must be free and equally available for all.

• Uncompromising insistence on the complete independence of the Internet from control by governments and private corporations.

• Unconditional defense of net neutrality and free, unfettered and equal access to the Internet.

• The banning and illegalization of government and corporate manipulation of search algorithms and procedures, including the use of human evaluators, that restrict and block public visibility of websites.

• Irreconcilable opposition to the use of the Internet and artificial intelligence technologies to carry out surveillance of web users.

• Demanding the end to the persecution of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and the complete restoration of their personal freedom.

• Advocating the transformation of the corporate Internet monopolies into public utilities, under internationally coordinated democratic control, to provide the highest quality service, not private profit.

• The fight against Internet censorship and the defense of democratic rights cannot be conducted through appeals to capitalist governments and the parties and politicians who serve their interests, but only in uncompromising struggle against them. Moreover, this struggle is international in scope and totally opposed to every form and manifestation of national chauvinism, racism and imperialist militarism. Therefore, those who are truly committed to the defense of democratic rights must direct their efforts to the mobilization of the working class of all countries.

So you can directly benefit from other workers doing well because more money flowing around serves to create demand for new coops or goods that you could work at if yours goes under or better welfare and social programs for you, or both (the most likely outcome).

"I really think AnCap should be called ""Market Anarchism.""",Conservative,7,b59pen,anarchocapitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchocapitalism/comments/b59pen/i_really_think_ancap_should_be_called_market/,13,"**TL:DR The 'capitalism' of today is the 'mercantilism' of yesterday... and [mercantilism](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&ei=dtOYXKviOPLR0PEP3ume0Aw&q=define+mercantism&oq=define+mercantism&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i10l8j0i22i30l2.5157.5699..5747...0.0..0.81.229.3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0.OUaHxQOdGBY) is not anarchist.**

It's less of an oxymoron. I know the capitalists in here are going to disagree, and the AnComs are probably laughing, but let me explain. 

The fundamental beliefs of AnCap can be summarised with the NAP and voluntarism. NAP is the non-aggression principle, for any outsiders. Honestly, I can't see how anyone can have a problem with the NAP, so I'm not going to get into this. Voluntarism, on the other hand, is the voluntary actions among people resulting in self-government and a free-market.

The reason I think we should be rebranded as ""market anarchists"" is because it actually makes more sense from the conventional anarchist's perspective. In fact, our ideology makes much more sense under this name since ""capitalism"" carries a very systemic implication and I do agree it doesn't feel very anarchistic. What non-AnCaps call ""capitalism"" is what ""corporate capitalism"" is to us and as I shitposted about before, it's the system we're currently in. Where the state systemically promotes ""capitalism"" through corporatisation, which protects your personal assets. This takes a lot of the risk out of business, since if Facebook belly-flopped tomorrow, Mr. Zucc would still be a member of high society. Facebook also isn't likely to belly-flop tomorrow though. See how this sounds a lot like mercantilism?

Basically, I'm saying ""capitalism"" is when the government is in the market, therefore, it's no longer free. If it isn't free of the state, then it isn't anarchist. Why do think libertarians love to ramble about getting government ""out of the market?"" [While by literal definition of ""capitalism"" is not a dirty word,](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+capitalism) I'm not going to deny that the word has been bastardised into it's modern crony counterpart. Why do you think corporations are called ""publicly traded companies?"" It's because they're 'public,' in other words, state mandated. (Public schools... Public library... public bus...) Corporations are a result of *laws,* which will let companies act as single entities and protect personal assets. Therefore, corporations are not a result of the market, but of the state. On top of that, it's a form of protectionism for wealth which is something seen in mercantilism, which **is not anarchist.** When the CEO of a corporation makes a dumb corporate decision, **his corporation gets sued. Not him.** Do you understand now? He can face no legal repercussions for what he does as ""Corporation Inc."" The employees usually sign a document which gives up some of that protection. Again, we live under *mercantilism,* where government enacts protectionism. 

Which led me into reading about Anarcho-Mutualism. While I don't see myself as an AnMutualist, it's good to note that Proudhon himself was not against the free-market. He was against systemic capitalism. AnComs at the time even went so far as to distinguish themselves from him because of this, since they saw any market as a form of oppression against the will of the people. Proudhon did not, as you can read in the ""criticisms"" section of the Mutualism Wikipedia page. Proudhon actually seemed to support the market and one AnCom went so far as to call him an ""individualist"" as opposed to a ""collectivist"" like an AnCom is, but he probably also didn't really believe in private property which is where I draw my grey area. As many will happily point out, there's little distinction between ""private"" and ""personal"" property. It's also strange to me that paying rent voluntarily is considered a form of exploitation. It's... voluntary. Conditional does not mean forced. You could also buy property instead. I see where the argument comes from, I just don't see how we could reasonably apply that to the real world as discerning between ""private"" and ""personal"" property becomes more of a grey area the more you question it. Is letting someone use your personal property in exchange for use out of their personal property exploitation? That's an exchange of goods and services. It's a market! ... **But it is not capitalism.**

So that leads me to my conclusion, where we should be rebranded as ""market anarchists."" We believe in voluntarism, the free-market, and the non-aggression principle. Sounds a bit better doesn't it? We're distinguishable from anarcho-mutualists in the fact that we see no distinction between ""personal"" and ""private"" property, but we aren't capitalists because we believe in a market without interference from the state and we believe that individuals can govern themselves through the NAP, the market, and arbitration. That sounds much more anarchist to me. The free-market is at the centre of our ideology, hence the name. I like to think that most anarchists aren't against the NAP or voluntarism, as you'd pretty much be against consent and you would believe in rule of force/aggression at that point. It's also good to note that the NAP is not a law. It's a right governed by the will of the people and their interpretation of the non-aggression principle. Enforcement is enacted through individual disputes in arbitration and violence is only allowed against a violent aggressor. Keep in mind that it's down to **the people's interpretation** of ""violent aggressor."" That idiot who yelled ""FIRE"" in a crowded building? You really think the arbiters and jury will say that didn't break the NAP? Probably not. Everyone could easily argue disturbing the peace is a form of aggression and it would be appropriate for that situation. Laws aren't always appropriate for every situation, this is why [judicial nullification](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+judicial+nullification) exists, and this system has that pro over it. In fact, some people equate judicial nullification to anarchy, since it puts the will of the people above the law, therefore, placing the people above the state. **This is literally about as anarchist as a judicial system can get.**

EDIT: Here's the link to the Wikipedia page. Formatting, the parentheses at the end, is preventing me from linking it with text. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) Ironically, I actually think AnCaps should give AnMutualists a little bit more respect and vice-versa. I find the two to be more related than most think, especially Proudhon. The ""capitalism"" in AnCap obviously scares a lot of them off and as I pointed out, AnCaps have no problem with private property whereas AnMutualists try to make that distinction between ""private"" and ""personal"" property. In fact, it was Proudhon's book *What is Property?* that convinced the young Marx that private property should be abolished. Proudhon criticised it; Marx wanted to abolish it. There's a difference and that is the difference that distinguishes communists from mutualists. Marx actually heavily criticised Proudhon, which is a bit weird considering how buddy-buddy AnMutualists have gotten with AnComs.

> In their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: ""I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction"".

**Proudhon was not a communist,** and he's an anarchist to me even though I don't consider myself AnMutualist.

> As a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected **both capitalism and communism.** He adopted the term mutualism for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers.

"Would you consider the film, ""The Green Room"", to be Agitprop?",Liberal,3,mswoep,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/mswoep/would_you_consider_the_film_the_green_room_to_be/,1,"So about half a year ago, I decided to watch the Jeremy Saulnier film known as The Green Room. I thought it was going to be a fun gory punks vs nazis film. It was not. I immediately regretted watching it because it was too real to me, as in the band members in the movie were way too close to my sister's friends growing up and the scenario was way too realistic and likely to happen. I'm bad with horror films but usually the fear is contained to jumping at shadows and minor stuff for a night and then I get over it. I wanted to buy a gun after watching The Green Room. It stayed at the back of my mind for like two weeks. Because those assholes are out there. Atomwaffen, Christian Identitarians, and just several brands of fascists that do want to hurt you and your friends.

So, I started thinking about it and read up on history of historical instances of antifascist punks like the SkinHeads Against Racist PunkS or the SHARPS that would fight against fascist ""punks"" at shows. Also the fact that the song ""Nazi Punks, Fuck Off"" was made by The Dead Kennedys to tell their growing nazi fans to go away. Now technically, these are not really Communist groups. They're anarcho-something at best. 

But there's a sort of message there that I wanted to see if anyone else believed in and who better to understand agitprop than this subreddit. Could The Green Room be considered (unintentional) Agitprop?",1618685789.0

What should we do with the media?,Liberal,20,rxor0f,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rxor0f/what_should_we_do_with_the_media/,13,"As we know, mass media are extremely influential in politics. In theory, this is good - it means that what they publish has an impact on the government. However, since mainstream media are, by definition, big business, they will disproportionately favour the right, attack any alternative that they feel might be bad for their business, and censor any inconvenient news. There are sometimes exceptions to this, but the general trend is pretty skewed.

Another problem with the press, which has become especially prevalent in the internet age, is the dichotomy between quality and accessibility. Good journalism is expensive and, ideally, needs the reader to spend some money on it; but that means bad journalism (if not outright fake news sites), which is free, is much easier to access. The result is that journalism is crap for the most part.

Both of these are, in a way, examples of market failures. The usual socdem way of dealing with this would be by regulating or even nationalising the sector, and there are some on the left who propose this, but there's a reason why freedom of the press is one of the most important values in a democracy. If the government can ""regulate"" the press, it will not be long before it's used to the government's (not the people's) benefit, which can quickly spiral into a dictatorship.

The question is, then, how do we deal with this? How do we balance the need for a free press with the fact that the press, under a free market, is not really ""free""?",1641502603.0
I have to get an abortion; don’t have much in terms of an actual “choice”,Liberal,24,rrl7y0,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/rrl7y0/i_have_to_get_an_abortion_dont_have_much_in_terms/,17,"I (26F) guess you could say I do have a choice—I can choose to keep it and raise it in a poor household, reliant on governmental assistance. Presently, I work 3 jobs and other 12 hours most days, 7 days per week—including in my chosen field (which I have my BFA in). Even so, I struggle to get by. I’m drowning in medical expenses and student debt (from attending a public university with scholarships). I was told I was infertile by my venerated obgyn, and used contraception with my partner, so this pregnancy is a major surprise. My partner is going back to school (and working his way through) and would have to drop out if I kept it. 

How am I supposed to afford daycare and maintain all my jobs? How can I raise a kid with all those jobs and pay $2300, the average market-rate monthly rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in my rapidly-gentrifying city? My work also isn’t unionized and offers no benefits. I would probably just have to quit, and focus on getting a higher-paying profession, even though I’m very passionate about my line-of-work (even though I’m severely underpaid in it). If only one job paid me enough so that I didn’t have to work three…

If there was universal childcare and healthcare, student loan forgiveness, paid family leave, an extension to the child tax credit, better/more accessible funding/grant opportunities nonprofits (which I work for) and free community college, then I could actually consider keeping it.

I’m really upset. All these “pro-lifers” and “pro-family” proponents are full of shit. If they were actually pro-family, then they wouldn’t make effectively being a parent a luxury. 

I’ve wanted a child all my life. I had been resigned to never reproducing. This is a miracle that I’ll have to terminate. I’ll probably never get pregnant naturally again. 

But, my options are: raise a kid super-poor in a late-stage capitalistic society where they will have few opportunities, and we’ll always be stressed/struggling while my partner and I give up all our current goals/dreams or terminate, and pray that I’m able to win the lotto and possibly get IVF treatments later on. Even if we had generational wealth, then we’d be in a much better position… Now, I’d better get back to work! Took too long of a break writing this. Later on, I’ll go on FB and see my wealthier friends showing off their baby bumps and toddlers with ear-to-ear smiles.",1640818288.0
Addressing Housing Affordability in Bangladesh,Liberal,1,qy3e3d,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qy3e3d/addressing_housing_affordability_in_bangladesh/,2,"I recently read an [article by the Daily Star about affordable housing in Bangladesh](https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/affordable-homes-all-1813060).

Although I support the Daily Star's mission to provide more housing to our fellow countrymen, I disagree with some of their proposed policies. Some of the policies I AGREE with include -

 \- Developing cities and towns outside of Dhaka

 \- Decentralising the housing market via better public transport and rail network.

 \- Reducing registration and construction costs

 \- Digitisation of land rights

 \- Financial support for the homeless

However,   I disagree with providing tax incentives/subsidies and cheaper mortgages to homeowners. I have lived in Australia for more than 5 years and this is the strategy that was employed by the governments of the last few decades. Although this temporarily increases the homeownership rate, it makes housing increasingly unaffordable since you're increasing the demand without addressing the supply issue. The strategy has cost the government a lot of money and has actively resulted in a housing crisis across the country. This [video ](https://youtu.be/zBQkYlMOiAc)by Australia's public broadcaster illustrates this problem very well.

The video also mentions a policy that was enacted by Robert Menzies,   Australia's Prime Minister in the 50s, which was actually more successful. This wasn't focused on providing cheaper loans to first-time homeowners, but instead, the government building a lot of housing and then selling them at a low cost. This resulted in the highest ownership rate (i.e. 70%) in Australia, which has never been replicated by the succeeding administrations.

Here are some of my proposals for addressing the housing problem in Bangladesh -

 \-   Tax incentives/subsidies and cheaper loans to property developers to   incentivise them to increase the housing stock in the country

 \- Land value taxes, in order to prevent land hoarding and incentivise the efficient use of land

 \- Vacancy taxes, to punish people who hoard housing and don't rent it out to people.

10 days ago on Sunday, February 13, Joe Biden assured Ukrainian leader Zelensky that the US and allies would respond “swiftly and decisively” if Russia invaded Ukraine.

CNN reported on the phone call.

President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a roughly hour-long call Sunday that the US would respond “swiftly and decisively” if Russia takes further steps toward invasion, according to a White House readout of the call.

&#x200B;

The call came amid US warnings that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen as soon as this week.

&#x200B;

“President Biden made clear that the United States would respond swiftly and decisively, together with its Allies and partners, to any further Russian aggression against Ukraine. The two leaders agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence in response to Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders,” according to the White House readout.

If they went to parties and got blackout drunk, did solo travel in foreign countries where they don't speak the language, stayed at strangers' houses, hitchhiked, went walking alone at midnight like many boys do then over 9/10 would be raped or at least sexually assaulted. Don't credit me entirely for this statement because I am paraphrasing another feminist whose comment I saw and vaguely remember.

And yes, not all men rape. It's a tiny minority of the male population who rape and assault women. But the thing is that predators don't have a big red flag on their foreheads, so we have to be careful with all men. So it shouldn't be seen as unreasonable if we want to meet our SOs in public and get to know them before meeting up in private, if we are wary of men walking on the street, or we don't want unsupervised male babysitters for our children. Yes men get raped/assaulted too but most victims are female and most perpetrators are men, the reason for this being biological (men are stronger and bigger and it's easier to force penetration than it is to force someone to penetrate), so men don't fear it in their everyday lives as much as women do.",1589589437.0

Those that do are doing their best to muddy the waters with lies and accusations of lies on the part of people who uncover the atrocities caused by socialist regimes.

Whether we like it or not, socialism is on the rise in the developed world. The opposition to socialism and economic literacy are also on the rise, but that isn't going to lower the risk of socialist sabotage of general freedoms, whether that sabotage is purposeful or not.

As far as truth goes, this isn't an equal battle. The truth is heavily stacked in our favor. Being able to communicate that fact without bias towards our beliefs is what will show that the truth is on our side. As of right now, superior argumentation and the mainstreaming of the arguments against socialism is the best way to get the average Joe to understand the dangers of it.

Become a professional in communist literature and talking points and the arguments against them, for the sake of the millions who have died under these regimes. Explaining basic economics only goes so far to people who won't listen or don't care. Learn their methods and the dishonesty and fallacies of their arguments, and let it be known to people who haven't been indoctrinated yet.

(Pure) Capitalism stands against everything humanity wants to and should be.,Conservative,0,rxbaoj,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/rxbaoj/pure_capitalism_stands_against_everything/,19,"First of all, no, i don't think communism is better, i just think that our modern system cannot be the full solution. Their either has to be a mix between capitalism and communism or a new better system needs to be created. Either way, back to the post.

Capitalism is based on exploitation of certain parts in the world, it is basically modern slavery, and there is really no counter argument. You can say, that with capitalism comes wealth, yet, really how many people are profiting of it? Well, scientific and technological progress came with capitalism, right? Yet again, how many people in the world really profit from the new, cutting edge technologies? And how many great minds did we loose in exploited parts of the world that would've taken us to another level?

We so often praise the human rights, but really they are incompatible with capitalism. Where is the freedom for people in indian/chinese/bangladesh fabs? Where is their right for individuality and self-expression? To find such examples, we don't even have to look that far, in each and every country, many if not most people have to work just for the sake of getting money to provide for their family. That cannot and mustn't be humanities future. Every human on Earth needs to have a liveable life by default, and not by achieving it through working.

I don't say we should abandon capitalism, who am i to say so, but i really hope that in the near or far future, people much smarter than me will create a near-perfect system, even it is difficult if not impossible.

Sadly, i have a feeling many people will just have me or like-minded people pegged as dumb commi's.

Where is the Woman human rights defender Noof Al-Maadeed,Liberal,61,rhrbsu,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/rhrbsu/where_is_the_woman_human_rights_defender_noof/,3,"  woman human rights defender **Noof Al-Maadeed** was reported missing after her return to Qatar from the United Kingdom  

 These reports made it clear that Al-Maadeed was kidnapped by members of her family late on the evening of 13 October 2021, after higher authorities ordered the police officers who were accompanying her to remove their protection and hand her over to the family. She had been promised protection before her return to Qatar 

 Al-Maadeed feared she would be killed, as she mentioned in a video she posted on her Twitter account, in which she said she had survived three failed assassination attempts by her family. Al-Maadeed also mentioned that her father entered the lobby of the hotel she was staying in, despite being one of her main abusers and the reason she ran away from her home. In the same tweet, she wrote: ""Sheikh Tamim is the only one who can stop the danger to my life with his own hands.""  

 It seems clear that even the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, was not able to provide the necessary protection to a citizen who did not commit any violations and voluntarily returned to her country based on many promises from the authorities to provide her with full protection.

Social Democracy and the state of Canada,Liberal,58,rvjh75,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rvjh75/social_democracy_and_the_state_of_canada/,60,"As a Canadian Social Democrat, I'm concerned about the state of Social Democracy in Canada, and thus the state of the nation as a whole. 

Let me list off things we have that are more-or-less characteristics of a SocDem society. We have a National Healthcare System, we have publicly funded employment services, we have the New Democratic Party and the Canadian Labour Congress as the primary political presence of Social Democrats and trade unions in Parliament and Government, a social safety net and we have the Canadian Pension Plan.

These are all attributes that I think are essential to a Social Democratic nation state and our possession of them should be recognized. However there are several problems that I think keeps us from being a full Social Democracy.

To start with, perhaps the biggest problem is our voting system. One of the things Canada has inherited from the British is the FPTP voting system based on single-member plurality. In this system, the proportion of seats a party gains in the House of Commons is not equal to the proportion of the vote a party receives. Instead, our parties gain seats based on how much of a majority they gain in a riding. This has resulted in 2 out of 10 Provinces being able to practically dominate the Parliamentary vote count and these ridings are seldom equal in population. It holds a similar problem to state representation in the US, in the sense that your vote only makes a substantial difference if you don't live in a riding that is considered a safe seat. If you live in Alberta, your NDP vote 99% of the time will be outnumbered by a largely Tory vote. If you're in Toronto or the Maritime Provinces, you're likely to experience outnumbering by Liberal votes. This has allowed an environment of tactical voting in which, rather than supporting parties that align with their interests, Canadian voters are more likely to vote for the Conservative Party (the Tories) or the Liberal Party in Federal elections (Bloc Quebecois if you live in Quebec). Neither the Tories nor the Liberals are Social Democratic parties and thus it becomes incredibly difficult to send SocDem reforms through Parliament without a lot of compromise. 

Second, our Universal Healthcare System is, well, not Universal. It's publicly funded, available based on citizenship and more affordable than Obamacare, sure. But it currently only covers 70% of healthcare needs and is subject to Federalism. This means that while some might call it a single-payer system, it isn't one because the funding is provided by provincial and territorial public health insurance systems, many of which are in Provinces that are currently run by Tory Premiers with austerity measures such as in Manitoba and Alberta. A typical trend ends up where while you're covered for ER and chemotherapy, you aren't covered for essential medications, dental and mental healthcare by this system and sometimes have to turn to private insurance companies. This creates a socioeconomic gap in healthcare. To make matters worse, there is significant systematic discrimination, particularly based on gender, sexuality and race. Due to the lack of adequate mental health coverage, people in the LGBT community are significantly more vulnerable since they then have to turn to private access of mental healthcare and this creates a huge social problem when they come from a low income household, because the LGBT community is among one of the worst affected communities for mental health. This is just a glimpse into the way that LGBT persons are affected by a flawed healthcare system. The matter regarding Indigenous access is something that will be discussed later, due to it being part of its own section on Indigenous issues.

Reaching now towards the matter of the Provinces, Canadian Federalism has been both a blessing and a curse. Ways its been good is allowing a degree of self determination to Canadian Provinces that are in many ways different from each other and thus can tackle their issues and priorities locally. But this has also allowed certain national priorities to lag, if not stop outright, because the Provinces can often be highly ideologically opposed. For example, the matter of climate change. Certain Provinces are committed to tackling climate change, but certain others have been either wishy-washy towards it or outright oppositional to environmental policy such as the status of fossil fuels. This also fuels the aforementioned tactical voting because we now have Provincial wings of parties that are unlike others. For example, in Alberta, the NDP has been very much in favour of fossil fuels to sustain a voter base in Alberta, a Province that has yet to demonstrate any willingness to advance environmental legislation.

Next we have Indigenous issues in Canada. Though the Liberal government has been offering lip service to Indigenous communities, actions speak louder than words and unfortunately, as the United Nations Human Rights report demonstrates, Canada has failed to live up to the promises it made. Indigenous communities are facing a wide range of issues that are frankly an embarrassing failure of Canadian ideas of human rights. Guaranteed complete healthcare coverage is ignored, with many Indigenous communities barely having access to any doctor, let alone an affordable one, and are unable to access quality healthcare, leaving them highly vulnerable to chronic illnesses and respiratory problems. Many Indigenous communities, in a first world country, don't have access to clean drinking water. Indigenous peoples are often overlooked when it comes to education and are less likely to find employment than non-Indigenous peoples. And Indigenous peoples face inadequate housing in Canada, with 44.2% of First Nations living in a dwelling in need of major repairs. Each of these are matters of human rights, which is a foundational philosophy of Social Democracy. 

Next we have housing. My God, where to begin. Our housing prices are insanely high. It currently costs a fortune to buy a home of any kind in several major areas and rent is continually rising. The government and several economists are acting like nothing's wrong, with the Liberal government doing nothing aside from a 1% taxation on foreign investment. Only recently has the housing crisis captured media attention and the current housing crisis has allowed intensification of wealth inequality in Canada. There is too much to talk about in this one post to give anything more than a brief picture, but if people living in a so-called Social Democracy are unable to afford something as basic as owning a roof over their heads, then it's hard to call it a Social Democracy.

Finally I want to talk about the parties themselves. The Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois. 

The Conservative Party has been more of a party of privatization and austerity in recent days. Provincial chapters have been cutting public services left, right and center.They're highly Neoliberal in the sense that the majority of the party establishment are Socially Progressive but their economic policies have been seperated into factions supporting status quo economic policy and more economically right wing legislation. The Federal Tories have been attempting to appeal to as many people as possible, but in turn have not demonstrated themselves as much else than being a status quo policy at best. 

The Liberal Party has demonstrated to basically be all talk and no action. Many like to think of the Liberals as a centre left party, but unfortunately, the Liberals have not pushed economic policy of such kind. A lot of the promises they have made they have not kept. Prime Minister Trudeau won the 2015 election on a promise of electoral reform, but we are still stuck with the same electoral system 7 years later. The promise of strong environmental policy has seen, at best, slow pacing and the Prime Minister has been caught up in many scandals related to corruption and even racism on occasion (besides the black face one). 

The Bloc Quebecois is slightly more Social Democratic but focuses more energy on Regionalism, which results in the Bloc's policies reflecting that of whichever party is running the Provincial Government of Quebec. As a result, the Bloc currently supports Bill 21, which bans government workers in positions of authority from wearing religious clothing such as turbans, hijabs and big crosses among others. Additionally, the Bloc desires exemption from the requirements of the Multiculturalism Act. It then becomes hard to define it as Social Democratic because Social Democracy involves social equality and freedom from discrimination as a core feature of its philosophy, yet the Bloc's proposals here do not represent this. 

Finally we have the New Democratic Party. The NDP has great qualities in it such as often coming off as more committed to the issues in Canada I have mentioned. It places healthcare reform at the forefront of its priorities and is more representative of the Indigenous peoples on a Provincial level. The problem is that if it's possible to be too willing to compromise, it's also possible to be too ambitious. The NDP is often crippled at the Federal level due to the unequal voting system and the fact that it has struggled to retain a good amount of voter counts. Many people do indeed like what Singh has to offer and find him appealing. But the problem is that he and other NDP politicians sometimes come off as too ambitious and not well detailed. As a result, there tends to be uncertainty regarding their policies and end up breaking for the Liberals (and the Bloc in Quebec). As a result, the NDP vote is more widespread and not concentrated enough to climb consistently high enough. 

I think a way to make Canadian Social Democracy stronger would likely involve uniting the NDP with the more left wing factions of the Liberal Party, the Bloc voters that have been disillusioned by the cultural policy of the Bloc and the factions of the Green Party into a more reformed social democratic Labour Party , as well as implementing a voting system that is more equally representative of Canadians.

Why do you want to be a cop?  Do you realize that every person that you initiate force(stop, search, fine, imprison, assault, kill) against for a victimless crime like;

drug possession/use

wrong sticker on their car

expired license

no seatbelt

no permit

failure to pay taxes

failure to pay fines

etc

is actually in truth a crime committed by you.  You are aggressing against that person because that person has harmed no one.  It doesn't matter what the law says, the law was wrong when cops enforced slavery and it's wrong now.  Every time you initiate force against someone who hasn’t harmed anyone, you are the aggressor and the bad member of society, not them.  

All vices contain within them their own punishment; addiction, relationship problems, loss of job, etc.  This is punishment enough.  It is wrong to lock people in cages who have not harmed others.  A person buying a drug from a drug dealer is engaging in a voluntary human interaction, capitalism at work.  If someone wants to sell something and someone wants to buy it-as long as they are not harming anyone else directly-there is no crime.  The drug war is a massive power grab by the state.  It allows them to use asset forfeiture laws to seize billions, protect the fascist pharmaceutical racket, protect the fascist alcohol racket, protect the plastic industrial complex, create a prison industrial complex, create a permanent underclass and a police state.  The drug war is a not a war on drugs, it's a war on people.  You are playing a key role in perpetuating it by aggressing against peaceful people.  If someone on drugs robs a store or kills someone, that person should face the consequences for violating the property rights of others.  However, there is no property right violation and no victim in using, buying, possessing or selling a substance.

Consider all the families you will tear apart.  The children whose fathers and mothers you will put in cages for all manner of victimless crimes.  Imagine the suffering you will cause them, when they ask: “Why won’t they let my mommy or daddy come home?”  It should be you who are forced to look that child in the eyes and tell them why you took their mommy or daddy away.  By destroying families you have recreated in the next generation the cycle of drug abuse and interfamilial violence that broken families create.  How many have you condemned to suffer in terrible government “shelters”?  Shame on you.

It's not your fault because you’re just following orders right?  Wrong, morality applies to you regardless of what uniform you wear.  It is your fault and there is nothing noble or heroic about surrendering your morality and blindly obeying authority.  A life serving the state will eventually eat away at you, you will come to see the pain you have caused others.  It will haunt you.  Much the way veterans who committed crimes in distant lands suffer mentally for their submission to the state and crimes against humanity, invading countries who never attacked them, kicking down doors, killing people, etc.  Unless you are a psychopath/sociopath you will be eaten away inside, your profession has unusually high numbers of them.  

Why not get a real job? Contribute to society.  Right now you’re taking and causing pain and suffering.  Where does your pay check come from?  It comes from taxation.  Taxation is theft.  When you take something that doesn't belong to you by force-whether you have agents do it for you or you do it yourself-it is theft.  

There is a truth called self-ownership.  I own myself, you own yourself.  We don't own other human beings.  I can only control that which I own.  I could only ""tax"" that which I control.  I can't go next door demanding a portion of my neighbors’ income because he is not my property.  A group that claims it has the right to take by force, makeup law and force it on others is a group that is asserting ownership over others.  No one has a higher claim to my life or my body than I do, it doesn't matter what uniform an aggressor wears.  Anyone claiming to own others as property is resting on false authority and is a tyrant.

But what about the social contract?  I never signed any social contract.  A contract that is made with someone before they are able to consent (birth) is an invalid contract by any legal measure.  A valid contract must have a meeting of the minds, the terms must be clearly outlined, understood and agreed upon.  The social contract has none of these qualifications.  It is a myth.

Let me ask you a philosophical question...If you as an individual do not have a right to go next door to your neighbors’ house and demand a portion of his income, how can you delegate that right to a  ""majority""?  How can one delegate a right which he himself does not possess?  It doesn't matter what uniform you wear, stealing is stealing, no “majority” will ever make that which is wrong right.

What is democracy anyway?  It is not even 51% forcing their will on 49%.  Sure the votes may be reported as 51% voted for X, 49% against X, but consider that most people do not even vote.  If more people don’t vote than vote will the state bow its head and dissolve?  It will not, more proof the state is a criminal gang that with illegitimate authority.  If a majority votes to hang a man, does that make it right? What of the man who enforces the will of the “majority” on the minority if the will he is enforcing is morally wrong?  

Ever notice how the state makes up words to hide what it's really doing? For example:

taxation is theft

war is mass murder

collateral damage is murder

asset forfeiture is theft

eminent domain is theft

jails are cages

etc

,they never say what they are truly doing.  This is a sign of brainwashing and propaganda.

People in the market who produce goods and services for the benefit of society are the real heroes.  Men and women who drive semi-trucks across massive distances to bring you goods, the employee who pushes your grocery cart back to the store in freezing weather, the doctor who tries his best to save people, the volunteer who risks his/her health caring for poor people in 3rd world countries, these are real heroes.  Soldiers and police officers are not heroes, they are people who have chosen to blindly follow authority, ignore their conscience and earn a living by parasitically taking from others who are subjected to the illegitimate rule of the state and its’ enforcers.

What good or service do you provide?  You say you provide security or law and order, but what does that mean?  How can those who claim to secure rights do so by violating the property rights of others to earn a paycheck?  How can you say what you do is a service when it's monopolized and everyone is forced to pay for it whether they want your “service” or not?  If Walmart was the only store allowed to provide groceries we would get bad service, high prices and bad products. Competition provides the best products and services.  Why monopolize and prevent competition?

Consider a market based organization.  If they do a bad job, they go out of business.  They receive signals from customers in the form of lost revenue, this tells them they need to change something.  Monopolized state organizations do not receive those signals because their money comes through force, they do not earn it voluntarily from willing customers.  If you want to provide protection and security without extorting people at gunpoint, look into Detroit Threat Management.  It is a free market organization that is so successful at providing security that it protects the poor for free.  DTM have never killed any of their customers.  Governments do not have customers-they only have slaves.  DTM is just one model for how we could provide security in the absence of the state, the market is infinite no one knows what people would engineer to provide security.  In the market, the best idea wins-as opposed to the state's authoritarian top down monopolistic one way of doing things.

Have you considered what you really do?  What do you do with a majority of your time?  You enforce laws; you look for people with the wrong color sticker on their car, people traveling faster than an arbitrary speed limit, people possessing a substance the state deems illegal, people doing business without permission from the gang in charge, etc.  All things with no victim.  It's not your job to ""protect and serve"", the supreme court has ruled on numerous occasions that cops have no duty to protect anyone.  What does it mean to “enforce law”?  Politicians write laws and if you are an enforcer for laws then you are an enforcer for the arbitrary whims of politicians.  You enforce whatever the politicians call ""law"".  That makes you a hired gun for the gang in charge.  Every law is actually a gun pointed at someone.  If I refuse to pay a seatbelt fine they will send a mean letter.  If I ignore that they will send men like you with guns to collect.  If I resist they will cage or kill me.  Every law is nothing more than a gun pointed at everyone (except the elite) and you are the one holding the gun.

One of the key functions police perform for the state is to create a fascist market.  In a market where participants are subject to the rule of a central authority, that central authority will form corrupt relationships with market firms.  They will scratch each others backs.  The government will get goods and services from the firm, the firm will get more regulations from the government which the ill-informed believes are for protecting them but in fact are for preventing competition to the firms favored by the state. The state favors large firms because it makes it easier to impose regulation and makes tax collection easier when there are massive employee payrolls as opposed to many small firms to keep track of.  The result is a few large powerful corporations who play friendly with the state and use state power to dominate everyone else.  Ever notice the revolving door between ex-pharmaceutical CEO/Monsanto CEO and FDA positions of power?  What of the military industrial complex ex-CEO’s gravitating to decision making positions in the military?  Without cops there would be no one to stop someone from competing against monopolistic firms and we would eventually see much smaller companies with much more aggressive competition working harder to provide cheaper, better quality products faster.  Companies like Yelp, Underwriters Laboratories, Urban Spoon and others are already doing a better job keeping customers safe than the state is.  An unintended consequence of your service to the state results in more expensive, poorer quality goods for everyone.

But what would exist without government? Wouldn't people be killing each other, raping and pillaging? On the contrary, that's exactly what the state does with its’ constant law making, regulation, taxation and wars.  To see the worst of society, simply look at government.  If the state disappeared tomorrow there would be a small period of disorder, but over time people would provide services like road building, security, infrastructure, etc.  Why would people do this?  Because they can make a profit doing so.  The free market has every tool we need to run the world, we don't need coercive murderous monopoly gangs.  The profit motive is all we need to have an orderly society.  People acting peacefully can provide everything you think we need a state for.  Besides, 99.99% of peoples’ lives are lived in anarchy.  We don't walk around with cops on our sides at all times.  Cops are few and far between, society functions just fine without them.  Business will go on, life will go on.

The idea that there is a special moral exemption for the state than for individuals is actually a religious belief called statism.  The truth is that morality applies across the board, no matter what uniform you wear.  Religions typically have rituals that assist in brainwashing their followers.  Consider the rituals of the state; 

Pledge of Allegiance (illogical/perverse devotion to cult)

Badges (guise of authority)

Uniforms (guise of authority)

Voting (petitioning the god of the state(prayer))

black robes (guise of authority)

funny hats (guise of authority)

human sacrifice (to die in war for the state)

flags (illogical/perverse devotion to cult)

etc

Statism is a religious belief.  The most dangerous kind because its adherents believe they have legitimate authority to rule over others.  No one has legitimate authority to rule others.

Change your life before it's too late.  Do something to help people. Don't be an enforcer for the politicians.  The future will not look kindly upon cops.  The future is a free future, it may take time but eventually the state will die.  Technologies that decentralize power like Bitcoin and the internet make this inevitable.  You have a chance to be on the right side of history, change now.

Private ownership regarding land,Conservative,21,sxpkad,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/sxpkad/private_ownership_regarding_land/,79,"The core of capitalism if private ownership which allows the accumulation of wealth and the betterment of society via mutual gain. This is the reason why today, we enjoy much more advance luxuries compared to our parents and things are becoming cheaper and cheaper. However, there is one area where that is not happening and that is real estate - land.

Land could be considered a very valuable asset to have and is among the most important capital of all. Land is inherently valuable and could be used for a variety of purposes including creating more capital. It also allows for the building of a shelter - a basic living conditions. A person with land would not need to pay rent which would save them money, the land could be converted to a business location, inherited by children and in most cases, the value of the land, in the long term, will appreciate. 

However, land cannot be created or produced using other material, it is a most definitely finite resource, even more so for lands in advantageous locations. Of course, more land could be ""created"" by creating more cities and towns, however, even this has its limits and is usually extremely difficult and time consuming, especially with regards to nature and the overall environment. On the other hand, population continues to grow exponentially which means those who are born earlier will have an unfair advantage compared to those born later since the value land will almost always appreciate. Under capitalism, land can be inherited and accumulated, later generations who are not born in families with real estate will face great difficulties where there is less real estate to go around. Where im from, almost all land/houses are either inherited or bought with money obtained from selling the real estate they inherited.

What are your thoughts monopoly tax in the US?,Liberal,42,qtg3wx,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qtg3wx/what_are_your_thoughts_monopoly_tax_in_the_us/,31,"
I think we can all agree that one of the leading problems in the American economy today is the high high degree of consolidation we have. There are a few firms that dominate most markets.

One solution is anti-trust, and I am all for that, but since the federal government doesn't seem to be able to get anything done I was thinking about what could be done on the state or local levels.

This led me to the idea of a ""monopoly tax"".

Here's how it would work:

If a firm controls say 80% (I'm not an expert, this number can vary, I just pulled 80 out of my ass) of the market, then they have to pay a 20% (another number pulled out of my ass) on their profits. This money is then put to one of a few purposes: funding social programs, improving local infrastructure, or my personal favorite, public investment/low interest loans into competitors to the firm. This way a successful firm cannot form a long term monopoly because as they grow larger and more successful they necessairly create more competitors and thus lower their overall market share and therefore this prevents the negatives of monopoly.

Possible objections:

Won't this raise prices for consumers?
Not according to this article: https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/monopoly/effect-of-taxes-on-monopoly-equilibrium-with-diagram/17081#:~:text=If%20the%20government%20imposes%20a,is%20like%20a%20fixed%20cost.&text=Hence%20the%20equilibrium%20in%20the,and%20price%20will%20remain%20unchanged.

Also, competition would force the price down to meet supply and demand options

Won't this face the same political issues we see on the federal level?
Yes, but states tend to have more homogenous political bases, i.e. California tends to stay democratic and Texas tends to stay republicans. Are there democrats in Texas and Republicans in Cali? Yes. But the majority tends to stick with one party, and so legalisation doesn't have to have bi partisan support to pass, unlike on the national level. Take a guess which party won't support it....

Wouldn't companies aim to be just below the stated market share?
Perhaps, but if that's the case then u have competition and the effect you are trying to prevent doesn't happen.

So yeah, what are your thoughts?

Thanks!",1636857303.0

All over Reddit, paid Russian government disinformation trolls are defending the fraudulent Arizona recount. Often, their defense is subtle — “let it play out”, “Trump lost and can’t be reinstated, so what’s the harm?”, “if you didn’t commit fraud, why are you afraid of the recount?”, “how is it fraudulent?” And we know that Putin’s piglet (what the Russian media calls Trump) sees this “fraudit” as his last hope. The fact that Russian trolls are so ardently defending it shows that Putin, too, sees it as his last chance to get Trump back in or, at the very least, to cause widespread violent unrest in the country.

Please write to your Congressman and Senators expressing your concern and urging them to press the DOJ to take action. If the Trumpist/QAnon firm conducting the bogus Arizona “audit” succeeds in altering enough ballots to falsely claim Trump won Maricopa County, Republicans all over the country will force the same procedure in every state Biden flipped and very well might take to the streets with even more violence than on January 6. This farce needs to be stopped now!

Just to recap about the “recount”:

1. ⁠AZ elections officials, including Republicans, conducted several recounts and found no discrepancies. They certified the vote as accurate. So, this is just grandstanding and a political power-play. 

2. ⁠The company Cyber Ninjas doing this farcical recount has no experience in such a thing, were hired by partisan Republicans, and are headed by a man who is a declared Trumpist and a Q anon adherent.

3. ⁠There is no oversight

4. ⁠It is illegal for non elections officials to handle sealed ballots

When this first started, those doing the recount had blue pens with them, which are totally illegal to have near a ballot as they can be used to alter a ballot. A judge had to stop that, but it was not until time had elapsed.",1625323007.0

Men and violent crimes,Liberal,1,m7mbhw,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/m7mbhw/men_and_violent_crimes/,4,"When it comes to violent crime and gender there is one fact that sticks out. Men commit violent crimes at a higher rate than women. But why is that? Some would tell you that men are just more prone to violence than women, however I believe this idea is wrong. Men don’t desire to commit crimes more than women, they're just more capable of committing them.

    For this argument an analogy is required. Let’s say there is an apple tree. The vast majority of people walk past the tree with no desire to pick the apples from the tree because they know the apple tree does not belong to them. Now an individual walks by the apple tree and stops. They look up at the apples growing on the tree and thinks to themselves “I want one of those apples.” however this person is 5 '4 they can’t reach the apples. Knowing this the individual walks away without the apple. Sometime later a second individual walks by the apple tree and like the last person they want an apple, but unlike the last person this individual is 6 ‘4 they can reach the apples. So they reach up and grab an apple. Both individuals had the desire to commit an act they knew was wrong, but only one of them was capable of going through with it. In the real world the 5 ‘4 individual would be a woman while the 6 ‘4 individual would be a man. 

    When it comes to violent crimes like assault, rape, and murder the desire to commit isn’t all you need, you also need the ability to commit. And since the victims of these crimes are mostly male with 76% of homicide victims being men. A perpetrator would have to be capable of overpowering the average man a task women are just not able to do. Women are held back by their morals and their physical capabilities while men are only held back by morals.

           So despite what the data would suggest men aren’t more likely to abandon their morals. It’s just that there is a small percentage of people who lack morals and within this group the men are the ones capable of following through on their impulses.",1616056023.0

*You also have rich people who have no money.*

*Example: Most entrepreneurs.*

*THEY are already on the road to wealth even though they have no money because they are developing their financial intelligence and that is wealth.*

*How are the rich and the poor different?*

*If you see a young person who decides to train, to learn new things, who tries to improve himself constantly, know that he is a rich man.*

*If you see a young person who thinks that the problem is the state, and who thinks that the rich are all thieves and who criticizes constantly, know that he is a poor man.*

*The rich are convinced that they just need information and training to take off, the poor thing that others must give them money to take off.*

*In conclusion, when I say that my daughter will not marry a poor man, I am not talking about money. I'm talking about the ability to create wealth in that man.*

*Excuse me for saying this, but most criminals are poor people. When they are in front of money, they lose their mind, that's why they rob, steal, etc... For them, it is grace because they don't know how they could earn money by themselves.*

*One day, the guard of a bank found a bag full of money, he took the bag and went to give it to the bank manager.*

*People called this man an idiot, but in reality, this man was just a rich man who had no money.*

*One year later, the bank offered him a job as a receptionist, 3 years later he was a customer manager and 10 years later he manages the regional management of this bank, he manages hundreds of employees and his annual bonus exceeds the amount he could have stolen.*

Due to the rise of neoliberalism and the rise of automatization and the lower need for workers in factories in 1970-1990, new right wing governments shifted economies to being more than 50% focused on the production of services. This now meant that more people are working in the services industry, 
The socialdemocratic response in the late 90's lead to third way economics, which accepted this new economic order, but the goods production was also very low, as the new left wing government focused on workers' rights rather than the economic model.
In developed countries with big production(like Germany) the goods production may take up up to 35%, but in less developed ones the services production is much bigger. This also puts the economy in a much more vulnerable position, especially in times like the Covid-19, and thus can cause big job losses.
In my opinion, what socialdemocrats should do, is, not necessarily scrap the current model, but make sure that the goods industry is strengthened to above 30% and, if possible, to also strengthen agriculture to a maximum of 5%(for example) while also putting more protection over the services industry. A way to do this is by running government investments for production of goods.

Representative Democracy has failed in Australia and led to COVID-authoritarianism (obviously).,Conservative,0,szd4gb,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/szd4gb/representative_democracy_has_failed_in_australia/,2,"To determine whether or not representative democracy is effectively working in Australia, we need to consider what the goals of representative democracy are. The primary goal of representative democracy is for the representation of the people and their views and said fulfillment of their views by said representatives. When considering this, it is important to say that in Victoria, the ALP, in which the current state administration is incarnated within, has a polling majority rate of 45%, whereas their primary opposition has 30% as of January 2022. So, under this criteria, representative democracy is effective. However, I would argue that representative democracy should have and does have a wider criteria to gauge its success. And the Australian government agrees with me:

&#x200B;

""Respect for individuals, and their right to make their own choices. Tolerance of differences and opposing ideas. Equity—valuing all people, and supporting them to reach their full potential. Each person has freedom of speech, association, movement, and freedom of belief. Respect for individuals and their right to make their own choices. Tolerance of differences and opposing ideas. Equity, valuing all people and supporting them to reach their potential. Each person has freedom of speech, association, movement, and freedom of belief. Justice, treating everyone fairly in society and in court, and tolerance of differences and opposing ideas."" - Parliamentary Education Office, source: [peo.gov.au](https://peo.gov.au)

Considering ""their right to make their own choices"", and ""tolerance of opposing ideas"" is characterised as a legitimate characteristic and key principle of a representative democracy according to the Australian government, then that aspect of representative democracy is failing, and is, therefore, an ineffective aspect of Australian democracy. The reason as to why this is failing is because of vaccination mandates, which does not allow tolerance of opposing ideas, 262 days of forced lockdown (which is literally house arrest in all but name) for all citizens in Melbourne, which does not allow people to make their own choices, and economic vaccine apartheid (the ability to be fired for vaccine status, which is an infringement of civil rights). Furthermore, journalists were, during lockdowns, selectively picked by the government which is a direct concern and violation of freedom of the press which is directly linked to freedom of speech, if the two are not one and the same. Additionally, freedom of movement is also being encroached upon with the entire fundamental aforementioned existence of lockdowns. Again, freedom of association has been infringed upon by the state government of Victoria, due to the very core tenet of lockdowns prohibiting and inhibiting who you can meet and converse with in person. Furthermore, according to the Australian government source as cited, ""respect for human dignity"" is a direct 'benefit of democracy'.  According to [humanrights.gov.au](https://humanrights.gov.au), which is another apparatus of the Australian government, 'human dignity' is defined as ""our society's commitment to the notion that everyone can enjoy their rights and freedoms on an equal footing,"" which has clearly been infringed upon with the rampant dissolution of our rights as Australians within Victoria. Even though everything that has been mentioned so far has been within a state (Victoria) scale, this has dire reflections and consequences for the rest of Australia, as the very fact that the federal government has tolerated and even engaged within some of the prohibitions against 'human dignity' speaks volumes upon the future and definition of Australian representative 'democracy'. To break it down, Australia has lost its right to call itself, upon its own definitions, a 'representative democracy' for the time being, and therefore it is obvious that representative democracy is inefficient in the current Australian political climate and situation. However, this is not an argument against democracy itself, it just highlights its flaws and how it is in jeopardy as we speak within Australia. This is what COVID-based measures do, they form authoritarian democracy. If we want to in the long-term keep our democratic values alive, and liberty perhaps as an extension of such, we cannot tolerate COVID-authoritarianism of any type, and ironically this is all in fact in violation of ""key principles of Australia's democratic system"" despite all being pursued and enacted by our 'representative democracy'.",1645607726.0

My whole life I was a moderate Democrat. I was a Physical science teacher for 22 years. Then I got very, very sick. 
I am 51. I have joint disease. Not the small amount of arthritis you get as you age. I’m talking every single major joint was bone on bone at 40. My spine was the worst and the last to be discovered. I was forced(I get it btw) to retire in 2016 when my knees started buckling and I kept falling while teaching. Once splitting my head wide open. I have a nice pension and my social security was awarded almost instantly. Phew! Money wasn’t a problem. I quickly found out who really cared about me though. 
So now , after 17 very brutal surgeries I am living on my own. My ex wife of 30 years(high school sweetie) cheated on me with my ex friend. My whole family knew about it and chose not to tell me. I found out 2 years ago and immediately divorced her and don’t talk to my family anymore. 
Anyway! Between surgeries I was crazy! Not good crazy. Suicidal crazy. Driving over a bridge a dozen times trying to get the nerve to stop and jump.

But any action that affects Russia's energy interests will highlight the role played by some of the West's biggest players, which have generated billions of dollars for the Russian state and are among the country's leading foreign investors. Here's how ExxonMobil (XOM), BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA) are helping keep Russia's oil-dependent economy afloat.”

ExxonMobil

The American oil giant has more than 1,000 employees in Russia, and has been in the country for over 25 years. Its subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), has a 30% stake in Sakhalin-1 — a vast oil and natural gas project located off Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. It has operated the project since 1995 on behalf of a consortium that includes Japanese and Indian partners, as well as two affiliates of Russia's largest oil company,

Shell

Shell says Sakhalin-2 supplies about 4% of the world's current LNG market. Japan, South Korea and China are the main customers for oil and LNG exports. A Shell spokesperson said it was monitoring the situation closely, but declined to comment on the company's investments in Russia.

BP

On its website, BP proclaims itself ""one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia."" BP also owns 49% of Yermak Neftegaz — formed in 2016 — which is conducting onshore exploration over a combined area of about 260,000 square kilometers in the West Siberian and Yenisey-Khatanga basins. The third joint venture covers the Kharampur project, in which BP has a 49% interest. Kharampur is a mature oil field but BP and Rosneft are planning to develop the project to pump gas. BP says there is potential to ""double overall field production."" BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It seems fairly apparent right now that the U.S. is going downhill. How bad that's going to be is still an open question. Climate change is getting worse and Russia and China have been trying to expand their influence around the world.

There may come a time in the not too distant future when the EU, for all that people like to criticize it, is the strongest block of democracies in the world. And that may happen at a time when U.S. support is no longer reliable, either because of American disintegration or a redirecting of priorities.

Land is either residential or commercial so people are forced to buy cars just to move around (why the hell are we letting the government tell us what we can or cannot do with our own property?!). Compare that to European cities where every block has a convenient store. The government literally subsidies highways and  the suburbs. I think everyone agrees that money could be better spent. There are some people who advocate for walkable cities but they seem to be doing so by pushing more regulations (for example banning cars or having the state create public transportation rather than private companies). Why don’t we get involved and advocate for the abolishment of these horrible regulations that ruin our cities?

The family didn't want their children fighting ""wars they didn't care about."" 

Volker became a successful businessman in Kansas City and was extremely generous with his wealth. He even became a voluntary taxpayer when he started the country's first welfare program in Kansas City. He later changed his mind on this idea when the Tom Pendergast political machine co-opted the program for their own purposes. He decided that private charity and free markets were the best way to support the poor. 

Towards the end of his life, he established ""The Volker Fund,"" which would go on to launch free-market scholarship during a time when these ideas were very unpopular in the U.S. He died ""middle class"" since he had already given away his wealth. The fund would go on to pay the salaries of Mises, Rothbard, & Hayek after his death in 1947.

"Because definitions of capitalist terms are always approximate, authorities who give definitions should also supply examples",Conservative,4,qsu1un,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qsu1un/because_definitions_of_capitalist_terms_are/,2,"When discussing a complex idea with a sympathetic collaborator, one must have clear definitions and unambiguously shared interpretations; otherwise nothing can begin. Unfortunately, the methods that are necessary for discussing complex topics with sympathetic audiences fail when discussing those same topics with hostile audiences.

Debates about complex topics are often unproductive because two or more sets of hostile participants do not share any clear set of definitions and interpretations. Even when the definitions appear to be terse and simple, the participants often interpret the definitions very differently. In the worst case scenario, opportunistic parasites prefer the confusion to any kind of productive debate and resort to emotion-provoking tactics to prevent debate and waste the resources of those who hope to debate.

By contrast, people who start from concrete examples may succeed in provoking unemotional and constructive debate. Example:

https://old.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/ntmg0a/the_lie_and_myth_of_nordic_socialism_debunked/

The original post of that thread has many flaws and I suspect I would disagree with the author, but at least the examples of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Kerala are clearly presented. If I doubt the author's facts, I can double-check the examples easily enough.   I believe the key point of the original author's discussion takes the form of his definition:

>**Nordic socialism** means deceptive politicians claiming paternity to good developments due to exogenous factors

For general purposes of technical communication, the lesson to be learned is that one must present a large, orderly set of interesting, relevant facts before one can get the audience to seriously consider a controversial definition. For the specific academic purpose of discussions related to capitalism, I am convinced of three lessons:

**Lesson 1**) Some key terms are going to be contentious and the best we can hope for is to chip away on their margins. The author could not hope to get people to agree on what ""socialism"" means but he could at least propose his definition for ""Nordic socialism""-- i.e. the phenomenon that exists when welfare state measures thrive on a foundation of prosperity laid by much older trends of productivity and conscientiousness.

**Lesson 2**) Distinctions between formal governments and state-owned corporations muddy the waters considerably. Example dispute: 

Point:

>Scandinavian governments don't own the means of production whatsoever. They own no factories or farms.

Counterpoint:

>They may not own any means of production but they sure seem to get very high monthly dividends (through company, sales and income taxes), so what's the difference? Either way, you get your share of the profits of the company. The ownership distinction is theoretical.

**Lesson 3**) The Protestant work ethic, or something very much like it, seems to be at the root of the ""classical liberalism"" that started Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Kerala on their respective roads to their current levels of prosperity.

I came across this video a while back (I didn't watch it as I refused to but looked up what happened...what happened to this poor woman...god). The movie is called No Good Deed and this scene is where a woman becomes the victim of her psycho ex after he confronts her on whether or not she cheated on him. What happened to herself was already horrific enough. And how one or two of the characters in the film reacted with a complete lack of compassion towards her was also terrible. But what I found the most horrific in regards to response to this scene was the comments on the video. People laughed, people said it was deserved, some said they didn't care...on and on. A few people said that they were all being vile for saying what they did in response to this poor woman. I posted a few comments saying they same and people still continue to scoff and laugh at this. I've tried to get it out of my mind...but still getting notifications of the same horrific messages and responses...it just goes to show what some people think about how women being the victims of the worst of men. 

If you read the comments...you'll see the complete lack of compassion in several of them...some saying she deserved what happened...some laughing at what happened in a way that makes fun of her for how she acts and what instantly happens in response. Can't remember at the moment if some said they didn't care because she cheated or slept with a married man (which is still horrifying how they see no horror in what they've said).

It just presents how in some people there's no sense of any level of sorrow or terror when women are being victimized.

I under the argument: laziness as an end rather than a mean *is* a virtue, because you strive to be lazy and will create, invent, and innovate to make life easier, so you can be lazy down the line. That’s certainly more of a virtue, especially if it enables *more* to be lazy. Capitalism is trending towards this virtue as automation develops over time.

But the more common encounter of laziness is as a mean, and *that* is a vice. It prevents you from creating, inventing, and innovating. You choose to do nothing instead of something. That’s not of high moral standard. Happiness, in itself, is a “being-at-work” state. You must strive and work for happiness. Laziness is the polar opposite, wherein you do *nothing*.

Dems trying to counteract these idiotic republican narratives never seems to work. We always let Republicans control the narrative and have to base the conversation on whatever dumbass shit they say.

Bio:

Josip Broz Tito was born on May 7 1892 into a mixed Croat-Slovene family in the small village of Kumrovec in Northern Croatia. During the first world War he was conscripted by the AustroHungarian Empire and Captured by the Russians, he later ecsaped the POW camp following the October Revolution, and would later volunteer to fight for the Bolsheviks, before eventually making his way back to Croatia at the end of the war During his time in Russia he met and married his wife Pelagija Belousova. Following his reurn to Croatia the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established out of the ruins of Austria-Hungary. During this time Tito became an Active member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) and distributed leaflets to fellow workers, for this he was arrested anf fired from several different Jobs, during this time his wife also suffered several miscarages. During the 1920s he continued to be an anctive Communist and was eventually given a prison sentence for this. His wife and son briefly went to live with sympathetic locals in his hove village, but Pelagija latter left Josip and retured to the USSR. Due to the poltical situation in Yugoslavia during the 30s, Tito and several other memebers of the CPY left the country and established offices in Czechoslovakia and Moscow, during this time . In 1936 he was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Commintern in order to recuit volutneers for the Republicans in the Spainsh Civil war, agian due to the anti-Communist laws in Yugoslavia he had to recuit most members from the Diaspora in France. Tito became head of the CPY in the late 1930s. Following the Fascist invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Tito began to lead an effective partisan resistance against the Fascist German and Italian occupyers as well as their collaborationist puppets like the Ustashe, this partisan resitence was one, if not the most, effective in all of Europe, and by the end of the War the Partisans had vertually Liberated all of Yugoslavia with only minimal help from the British ans Red Army (both of whom provided material to the reisitance Fighters. Following the end of the war a provisional government and state - the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was set up, Tito's party soon won elections that were held and the Monarchists lost all support from the people. Tito was incredably popular at this time as he was seen as the 'Liberator of Yugoslavia.' this state was soon succeded by the  Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia with Tito as it's leader, during this time he also took the honouriffic title 'Marshal of Yugoslavia'. The late 1940s-early 1950s saw a deteriation in relations between Tito and Stalin which eventually led to the Tito-Stalin Split, During this time Yugoslavia became a chamipion of the Non-Aligned Movement, with Tito being the Chair of the movement between 1961-64. Tito continued to rule Yugoslavia and develope a unique form of market Socialim which differed from neibouring Warsaw Pact state's planned economies. Tito died on May 4 1980 and was given a state funeral which was attended by numous digitaries.

Austrias Revolutionary for Social Welfare - Ferdinand Hanusch,Liberal,30,rjdmir,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rjdmir/austrias_revolutionary_for_social_welfare/,7,"Hello colleagues, friends and *GenossInnen*

as is to be expected, Austria is often enough not mentioned in this sub for its achievements in terms of Social Democracy. But what should I expect ...

To change this once again, I'd like to tell a bit about one of the movements most famous but often forgotten members here in Austria. A curious person that tried to escape his village a few times, a man that saw the real devastation of industrialisation and pre-war capitalism. One that would change a lot of things - which echo until today.

Let me tell you of Ferdinand Hanusch.

&#x200B;

**Birth and early upbringing**

Ferdinand Hanusch was born on November 9th 1866 in *Oberdorf bei Wigstadtl* (today Vitkov in the Czech Republic), then part of Austrian Silesia, Austrian Empire (only in 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be declared). His home region was only months before invaded by the Prusssians in the War of 1866, *Wigstadtl* was very close to the border to Prussian Silesia and known for its huge production of cloths.

His father soon died after his birth and Ferdinand grew up with three older brothers. Hanuschs mother was a *Hausweberin* or *Hausarbeiterin* (house weaver/house worker - meaning that she worked from her own home and not in a factory). Generally the family was poor and the children soon had to help contribute and earn money for their own survival. These memories lodged deep inside young Ferdinand - he went to basic school and found a love for reading which angered his mother.

&#x200B;

**Fleeing Vitkov - going on** ***Walz***

His first job was as a *Hilfsarbeiter* (unskilled worker) on the weaving machines in a cloth factory. \[A little anecdote here: I share the same job title and description right now - I am currently a *Hilfsarbeiter* as a storage guy for a small electronics company in my home region.\] This didn't satisfy young Ferdinand (at this time he was under 18 years old) so he left his home and went on *Walz* (better known as *Wanderjahre* \- journeyman years, which were quite common in this time and can be seen from time to time in Germany and Austria).

For Ferdinand it was both an adventure as well as an escape from the dreadful state of affairs in his home region. He escaped three times - the first Walz at age 17 (1884) went via *Odrau* (*Odry*) and *Tobitschau* (Tovačov) to *Kremiser* (Kroměříž), via *Göding* (Hodonín*)* and Weikersdorf reaching Vienna/Floridsdorf. From Vienna he travelled thorugh Lower Austria and Styria to *Cilli* (Celje) and *Laibach* (Ljubljana) towards Triest - either on foot or per railway. In Triest he was captured by police and sent home to Vitkov.

But he fled Vitkov another two times (between 1885 and 1887), the third time apparently reaching Constantinpole (*Istanbul*). Both times he was captured by police and sent back to his mother. Through his travels Ferdinand gained valuable insights not only into the condition of workers but the condition of the Empire as well.

After the third *Walz* (and probably pressured by his mother) Ferdinand found a job in a local silk factory in *Wigstadtl*.

&#x200B;

**The workers movement** 

With 25 years Ferdinand Hanusch engaged in the workers movement which was organised only two years ago in Hainfeld. After a few years he'd be union and party secretary in *Sternberg* (Šternberk), a center of textile production in Moravia. Steadily showing his work and enthusiasm he was a valuable part in founding the *Gesamtösterreichische Union der Textilarbeiter* (Overall Austrian Union of Textile Workers), the first specific trade union. Following the foundation he was voted as *Sekretär* (Chairman/Secretary) fo the union by its members. Hanuschs most important points were work time reduction and strenthening of working rights in the entirety of *Cisleithanien* (Cisleithania was the Austrian part of the monarchy).

This would be followed by a call to Vienna in 1903, making him one of the chairmen of the *Freien Gewerkschaften* (Free Trade Unions - organised by the Social Democrats). In this position he was heavily involved with social policy as well as working conditions of the texile industry and international congresses.

1907 would bring another stepping stone for him - after the universal male voting right (still excluding women) was introduced the same year, Hanusch was voted into the *Reichsrat* for his home region as member of the *Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei* (Social Democratic Workers Party) where he would remain until 1918. In the *Reichstag* he advocated for one of the founding principles of the party, the 8 hour work day.

In 1916, during World War I, he was able to reach an agreement introducing legal joblessness support for the textile workers as well as in 1918 reducing the work time on saturdays to six hours.

&#x200B;

**Birth of Austria - unleashing a genius**

In late October, exactly the 21st, as the dissolution of the Empire came ever closer, Hanusch automatically became part of the *Provisorische Nationalversammlung* (Provisional National Assembly) for *Deutschösterreich* (German Austria - todays Austria). Automatically in this case means he was member of the *Reichstag* for his home region, which was mostly german and considered to remain with Austria. But this didn't last long - Austrian Silesia soon was occupied by Czech forces and the newly founded Czechoslovak republic claimed all German speaking areas inside Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia.

Therefore, he was elected into the *Konstituierende Nationalversammlung* (Constituting National Assembly - working on a new constitution) on March 4th 1919 in an Austrian seat. his last election was in November 1920 for the newly established *Nationalrat* (Austrian Parliament and lower chamber) where he would remain until his death.

During the time of the *Provisorische Nationalversammlung*, in which a collective government of Social Democrats, Christian Socials and All-Germans ruled Austria, Hanusch went to work to improve the conditions of workers - and this all with a fervor and rapidity yet unmatched. For fear of the Russian Revolution and Bolshevism in general, the conservative parts of the government were a bit easier on the Social Democrats and allowed for a lot of reforms to avoid the same fate as Tsarist Russia.

Ferdinand Hanusch would lead the *Sozialressort* (Social Department), later named *Staatsamt für soziale Fürsorge* (State Agency for Social Welfare) until 1920.

&#x200B;

Now in detail the achievements of Ferdinand Hanusch and his colleagues (prominently Otto Bauer) in a timescale:

**1918**

The reforms started on November 4th with the introduction of Industrial Commissions for Organising Employment services. These would result in the AMS (Arbeitsmarktservice) in modern Austria.

November 6th: public Support for Invalids and workers without occupation. On November 11th and 12th the Empire collapsed - Austria was founded as a democratic republic.

November 19th: introducing the 8 hour work day in factories of any size, laws and securities for *Heimarbeit* (Working from home - these were inspired by his upbringing and the fate of his mother), laws extending trade supervision, reducing worktime to 48 hours

November 20th: public unemployment support of workers and employees.

**1919**

January 25th: disbanding *Arbeitsbücher* (Work books - those were used to identify a worker and former work providers could threaten workers with bad reviews that would be written into the books etc.), stregthening laws for ending of working contracts in favour of workers and employees, establishment of the *staatliche Wohnungsfürsorgefonds* (public home welfare fonds)

February 4th: law on expropriation for the purpose of homes/residence

April 25th: *Invalidenentschädigungsgesetz* (Law for Compensation of Invalids) - this included public support for invalids in form of public insurance, old and survivors insurance for all as well as insurenace in case of illness

May 14th: ban on night work for women and children under 18, children over 12 were allowed to work under certain conditions

May 15th: *Gesetz über die Errichtung von Betriebsräten* (Law on the Foundation of Workers Councils)

July 30th: *Arbeiterurlaubsgesetz* (Law for Workers Holidays), granting them more hoilday

December 17th: *Gesetz über den achtstündigen Normalarbeitstag* (introducing 8 hour work days for everyone)

December 18th: introducing *Kollektivverträge* (Collective bargaining) and thereby granted *Mindestlohn* (minimum pay)

**1920**

February 28th: foundation of the *Kammer für Arbeiter und Angestellte* (Chamber for Workers and Employees - a bit like a union for all workers and employees that helps everyone and where every worker is part of it)

March 24th: *Gesetz über die Arbeitslosenversicherung* (Law on Unemployment Insurance)

&#x200B;

**Outside of government and death**

All of these achievements were revolutionary for their time. The only country with the same level of care for workers and employees as well as social welfare and workers participation in 1920 was the Soviet Union. Hanusch managed all this while being responsible for Social Welfare and for a short time Vice Chancellor.

As the Social Democrats left the government in late 1920, Hanusch became the first leader of the *Wiener Arbeiterkammer* (Viennas Chamber for Workers and Employees) in 1921. He organised this institution to be a strong bulwark for the questionf of working people alongside the trade unions. Alongside this he was active on the international level with congresses and supported *Arbeiterbildung* (workers education) quite heavily with the foundation of several workers schools and libraries.

Ferdinand Hanusch considered the weapons of the working class to be *frische Luft, viel Licht, Bücher und gute Heimstätten* (fresh air, much light, books and good homes). In this time he continued his writing which he took up in his time in Vitkov- he would be known for his special style of writing.

Sadly, Ferdinand Hanusch died on September 18th 1923 at the age of 56.

Today, one of Viennas hospitals is named after him as well as several streets in Austria. His bust is one of three at the *Republikdenkmal* (alongisde Victor Adler and Viennas first Social Democratic Mayor Jakob Reumann) near the *Parlament*.

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

Although often forgotten, the legacy of Ferdinand Hanusch lives on in law and institutions. He did in a short time a lot for the improvement of working conditions and lives of the people overall. These achievements echo into our modern times and I was able to profit from these more than once. As I mentioned before, I am a *Hilfsarbeiter* from time to time besides my studies. Hanusch was not only a reason to join the party, but to join the union as well as engaging in questions of social welfare as well as working rights today.

For me Ferdinand Hanusch is a great hero and a huge inspiration, an idol so to say. Therefore I hope that this story might inspire you as much as me to work for the betterment of all!

I've never been good at explaining things. I always understand it thoroughly, but when it comes out of my mouth, it sounds terrible.

A little backstory

I was with my girl and her parents, and we were talking about my girl's brother. Her brother doesn't think there should be police. I added my two cents by saying something along the lines of, ""I don't think there should be government owned police considering the government as a whole is rather corruptible. Instead I think there should be privatized security.""

Immediately her step-father started saying how without police, it would pretty much just be the purge. Then he started saying how private companies owning police would result is the poor not getting any protection.

Her mom agreed with me, and understood what I meant and they started arguing. I had no idea what to say after that without repeating what I had already stated prior.

How exactly would I go about explaining private sector security?",1457998717.0

Help figuring out Libertarian ideas on economics,Conservative,3,su3iy5,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/su3iy5/help_figuring_out_libertarian_ideas_on_economics/,45,"Hi, I'm new to the realm of libertarianism and politics in general so please bear with me if this has been asked before haha. I have asked around but I think people assume I am a troll or an idiot so I just decided to make a post.... I have always liked the ideas about individual freedoms and the ability to have complete agency over your life which is why I am here. One of the main questions that arise in my mind now that I take a serious look at libertarian ideas is how we address the question of big business. I am curious what your guys thoughts are about, what I would see as, the natural path of big business unhampered by regulation. I think back to learning about Standard Oil or Carnegie Steel etc and how they eventually bought up everything from the natural resource sites, to the means of transporting it, to the factories making the products etc... making it essentially impossible to enter the market as a small business.  With the lack of competition, or even with competition, when I look back at times with less regulation I see things like workers being paid at subsistence rates and massive income inequality. I see things like the triangle factory fire where the factory was literally locking people in to work. 100+people per 1 toilet etc. I kind of feel like if left unhampered big corporations would become incredibly powerful. They already manipulate the government with their massive amount of power and money, it seems if they could have it their way they would get rid of all regulations on them all together and are glad to have libertarian support in that way. Is there a general consensus on how to approach these difficult topics without government intervention?  As a side note, it almost seems like you'd end up in a new age feudal Jeff Bezos/Elon Musk run city if you really took it to the extreme, nothing would stop someone that rich from raising a private army/police force right? Thanks for the time, I'm sure I'm missing some major points as this is extremely broad and as I said I'm fairly new.",1645038163.0

However, I'm certain that my manager and my manager's manager wouldn't appreciate me writing ""keep my job and get paid"" as my work goals.

Neoliberal heaven exists... and is hell,Liberal,145,rh0kaq,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rh0kaq/neoliberal_heaven_exists_and_is_hell/,99,"I was thinking to write this here since the 1st of December. Why then? This is the national day of my country, Romania. In Romania we have two kinds of people (I think most Balkans have them): those who believe that we experienced major improvements in quality of life in the past 2-3 decades and those who see the world in very dark colors. I am part of the latter group. 

On that day, a well known investigation journalist posted a message in FB which stated that he constantly receives messages from Romanians who live abroad after his findings are published. The messages are mostly the same ""thanks for reminding us why we left the country"". He then says that while he knows how things work here, he will be the last to leave. One of the reason being the progress we have made in the last 30 years. He gives a some [stats](https://panorama.ro/interactiv-cum-s-a-schimbat-viata-in-romania-dupa-1990/?fbclid=IwAR1leCF1oM6qRJiO-8A1xck4UiUnuDwQTgmGxKvALnZWkKSZjIopOLPsOUI) (link on Romanian, but readable with translate).  I looked upon those and many are, in my opinion, the numbers of a failed economic experiment.

So, back to the first part of the title: ""neoliberal heaven exists"". Romania in a way is a good example of many neolib wet dreams becoming reality. As most of you know, we were a commie country during the Cold War. The 90's was the decade of when our neolib experiment started. The main phrase used by neolibs during that decade was ""to quickly partition the cat"". Especially during the right wing govt in 96-2000.  This means to quickly privatize state companies. Indeed, the former commies that we had between 90-96 were not that keen, but there still were some privatizations. From 1996 the vast majority of state companies were sold, even by the ""social-democrats"" that ruled from 2000-2004.

The 2000's and 2010 brought new neolib policies. One is the flat tax rate. Romania is one of the few countries with a flat tax rate (16%) since 2005. The other is to have a ""slim state"", meaning that we should have as few state employees as possible. That worked. We have the [lowest percentage](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20171024-1) of public admin. employees in the EU. 

Another topic was the wages. We need to have low wages in order to attract investors. That happened.  Wages only increased slightly. The largest single increase was recent, in 2017-18.

Corruption. This is a big problem here, but in many respects helps large companies and many smaller ones. With some bribe, you can shield yourself from health inspections, from Fiscal authorities and so on. In fact, one of the largest insurance companies just recently collapsed and the overseer in this field never suspected anything. State policy here is not to bother large companies. They can, more or less, do as they please. Anyhow, the company collapsed and prices for mandatory car insurances trebled in some cases (as in the case of my parents). Corruption kills, of course. In 2015 the fire at the ""Colectiv"" night club killed 64 people. The Firefighter office never bothered the owner to improve club's fire protection. Cost effective, right?

Heaven may not exist. Neoliberal heaven may not exist, but by having a flat tax rate, few govt employees, low wages for the most part and letting companies large and small running wild, Romania is close to such a heaven.

Now for the **hell** part.    

Hell is the result of those policies. That statistic that I linked mentions some improvements like in life expectancy and infant mortality rate. Bragging about this is like bragging that  you know how to walk. Even Afghanistan or D.R. Congo had improvements here. 

Since 2005 the number of kids leaving school early rose. The quality of schooling decreased (just look at PISA tests results). Many schools and hospitals were closed during the Great Recession when we had a right wing govt. 

The GDP rose by 6 times since 1990. The GDP/Capita rose too. But... so did the Inequality index ([GINI](https://www.statista.com/statistics/874070/gini-index-score-of-eu-countries/)) and the poverty rate did not decrease. We are the 5th most unequal country on the continent.  According to [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/edn-20201016-2) we have the second highest poverty rate in EU. According to INS (the Romanian statistical service) the poverty rate in 2007 was at 24,6% and it decreased to 23,8% in 2019. A ""whooping"" 0,8%. 

The social effects are devastating. While a small middle class appeared and quality of life for some in the cities greatly increased, the changes for those in medium and small town and especially villages stagnated or improved only slightly. The variety of products and their quality increased greatly (especially compared to communist era or the 90's), but many can not afford them. 

The biggest sign of this failed economic system is migration. We do not know exactly how many left, but there are at least 3 millions (from a population of 19 million in 2002). Some say close to 6. Between 2007 and 2015 we had the second [highest](https://business-review.eu/news/3-4-million-romanians-left-the-country-in-the-last-10-years-second-highest-emigration-rate-after-syria-159038) migration in the world, after Syria! A war thorn country. ""Exodus"" is in many cases is used in an exaggerated manner, but not here. And keep in mind that 0,8% decrease in poverty. The vast majority of migrants were part of the poorest strata of society. Even with millions of poor people leaving we could not decrease the rate. 

All this lead to a very polarized society. Fueled by low education, poverty, hyper religiosity, inequality, nationalism, the society is divided in many spheres that have almost nothing in common. Not even the desire to protect others from COVID by taking the jab. As you know, we have a very low vaccination rate and conspiracy theories are the mainstream. 

Anyhow, many people think that things will not change. 80% believe we are heading in the wrong direction. Almost all. A record. Also, close to 700.000 (you read it correctly) people want to emigrate in the near future. We are a demographic time bomb. 

So, yeah. This is how neoliberal heaven looks like. Great for an accountant, awful for almost anyone else. 

You know very well know how liberals and conservatives make fun of tankies, but even of us, soc-dems when they hear ""social"", that ""real communism hasn't been tried"". Well, I wonder when the neolibs here will say that real liberalism has never been tried here. 

[Olof Palme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i2Ws1X5DSA) has that great speech where he talks about why he is a soc-dem. Well, in my case, the reason why I became a social-democrat is simple: I live in a society that never had social-democracy.",1639579187.0
"Five myths about the Code for Families, that right now is in popular consulting in Cuba...",Liberal,14,sxyvmz,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sxyvmz/five_myths_about_the_code_for_families_that_right/,0," The  new campaign of the Miami right-wing against Cuba is distorting the  Family Code, which at this time collects opinions from the population  throughout the island. The enemies of Cuban society even resort to the  old worn-out lies about the state taking away ""patria potestas"" from  parents over children (the same lie that caused ""Operation Peter Pan""  between 1960 and 1962, which caused 14,000 Cuban children were sent by  their parents to the US alone, thanks to a CIA - Catholic Church setup,  citing a law that never existed and anti-communism).

So, let's take a closer look at the 5 myths that are spread against the new Code:

**1.    Myth: Parental authority is eliminated and replaced by parental  responsibility, which is a term that diminishes or annuls the legal  authority of parents over their children.**

Reality:  Although it is true that in the Project the name of parental authority  is changed to parental responsibility, the mistake is in assuming that  this last term means that parents will lose control over their children,  or the rights that the law assists them as parents.

**2.  Myth: Minors can marry at the age of 16, with the authorization of a court and not of their parents.**

Reality:  Article 3 of the Family Code of 1975 –currently in force– does empower  parents, and in their absence, other persons established by law to  authorize exceptionally, and for justified reasons, the formalization of  this union in minors 18 years of age, provided that the woman is at  least 14 years old and the man is 16.

**3.   Myth: The concept of progressive autonomy is implemented, which will  allow minors to make decisions without the consent of their parents,  which implies that they will be able to change their name from Pedro to  María, and vice versa, or even change their sex through an operation and  hormonal treatments.**

Reality:  In the voice of renowned jurists and psychology professors, progressive  autonomy does not imply that your son or daughter, out of sheer  rudeness or whim, will be able to do what they like, without even  knowing the consequences of this action.

**4.  Myth: The Cuban State wants to take away the custody and care of our children.**

Reality:  As if wanting to rewrite another Operation Peter Pan and the lies that  served as a hook for parents to believe that the Government was going to  take away their children to send them to Russia and return them like  canned meat, an attempt is being made to create a state of opinion in  around the Family Code, under the motto: The children belong to the  parents, not the State.

**5. Myth: Solidarity gestation is implemented, which will allow offering wombs for rent.**

Reality:  Article 128 of the new Code project defines the scope of pregnancy in  solidarity, by establishing that it proceeds between people united by  family ties or emotionally close, for the benefit of women with a  medical pathology that prevents pregnancy, or of people who present  sterility, or single men, or couples of men, provided that the health of  the people involved in the medical procedure is not endangered.

The republicans were the party of free trade and sending jobs over seas and many middle class republicans and poor republicans would still vote republican then Trump comes and is against free trade and turns out a huge chunk of the Republican base has been against free trade this whole time even though they kept voting for a party that supported free trade before Trump.",1636228239.0
"“If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume.

&#x200B;

""If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume. Your goal should be to create value for everyone you interact with. Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out."" -

&#x200B;

In the letter he pretty much outlined what Amazon has accomplished so far:

1. Pioneered cloud computing almost a decade before any of the other tech giants (Google, Microsoft)... Which has allowed other companies (Reddit) to grow and scale to where they are today.
2. Has given small companies and businesses the same compute resources as a giant tech company via AWS.
3. Has given people a lot of their time back that they would’ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.
4. Has employed over 1.5 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $18/hr and good health benefits. Amazon’s net profits in 2020 was around 21 billion dollars. They pay their employees 90 billion dollars in wages and other benefits.
5. Yeah Amazon’s founder has 180bn net worth. But by founding and spearheading Amazon, he also created \~1.6 trillion dollars worth of wealth for other people (Amazon’s total market cap is at 1.8 trillion dollars). A large portion of that wealth are in pension funds, 401Ks, and Universities.

&#x200B;

Overall I think the reason why I think a lot of people hate him and Musk is due to something called crab mentality:

&#x200B;

""Crab mentality, also known as crab theory, crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket, or pot) mentality, or the crab-bucket effect, is a way of thinking best described by the phrase ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". The metaphor is derived from a pattern of behavior noted in crabs when they are trapped in a bucket. While any one crab could easily escape, its efforts will be undermined by others, ensuring the group's collective demise.

&#x200B;

**The analogy in human behavior is claimed to be that members of a group will attempt to reduce the self-confidence of any member who achieves success beyond the others, out of envy, resentment, spite, conspiracy, or competitive feelings, to halt their progress.""**

&#x200B;

That's why a long time ago people were fanboying over Elon Musk when he was in 15-20th place. But as soon as he became the richest person on Earth suddenly everyone wants him to fail now. And that he and Bezos should stop focusing on space travel and instead donate that money to other people.",1637639720.0

Basic capitalism tutorial for some of the USA,Conservative,3,t0ok92,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/t0ok92/basic_capitalism_tutorial_for_some_of_the_usa/,3,"Alright, if by some chance someone needed a little help to benefit off of capitalism.

Lets over generalize and say there's two types of people in the USA.

&#x200B;

People whose choose failure regardless on if they have the solution(s) and materials needed to pull off that solution.

&#x200B;

The second group not wanting failure but are open to solutions brought up. They basically already are living to an extent but aren't sure how to optimize everything so that their margin of errors are far less thin.

&#x200B;

Lets say you're the second group who maybe are a socialist or whatever have you, and you actually want to benefit more off of capitalism but aren't sure how. Either because somebody called ya an idiot or your peers peer pressure you into doubling down on questionable behaviors.

(I believe there was a study that did that. They had a test subject in a class room and if the entire control group were to consistently get the wrong answer, the one test subject would fall in line eventually, but that aside)

&#x200B;

First off some disclaimers. This will not work (or at least, not as well as alternative areas) in all territories/states of the USA. New York, California, CHAZ is an immediate no no, and just in general, deep blue city centered states.

&#x200B;

Second disclaimer, this is assuming you have no weirdly specific allergies. So Soy won't cause problems, no allergies against wheat, rice protein, no weird veganism elitism where if it is easy it isn't real veganism, you're a omnivore so you can eat as needed, etc.

You got two arms, two legs. Basically you're as ""normal"" as normal as can be.

&#x200B;

Finally, this ideally works best if you have a smartphone (Apple or Android is fine). A computer with a reasonable internet would work too.

&#x200B;

Okay ready? Lets do this.

&#x200B;

To make things simple and more easily graspable, lets say there's three pillars of the individual's responsibilities in the USA.

These three pillars are as follows (Note: In no particular order of importance),

Financials, Physical Ability/Abilities, and Intelligence.

&#x200B;

We're gonna start with the Financial Pillar first so we can fund your other Pillars effectively later on.

&#x200B;

Firstly, go to the App-Store/Google-Play.

Look up a financial budgeting app that's free called ""EveryDollar"". Imo the paid subscription for the ""premium"" features is mediocre, so stick with the free version.

I recommend this app as it is straightforward/clear to use. No need to get an app that's overly complicated. So stick with simple for now.

EveryDollar exists on PC as well. Data carries over between both mobile and PC versions.

&#x200B;

Set up your account in EveryDollar.

Once that's done, pick a month to ""start"". Ideally you want to use your soon to be made financial budget plan for a entire month, not have it start midway into a current month.

&#x200B;

Lets say for example its December 2021 and in a week it will be January 2022.

Make your budget for January 2022, not December.

This is because starting out, your current goal should be to see where your money is going to start with before we start dialing back certain bas financial behaviors.

&#x200B;

After picking a month to make a budget for.

Go to income and estimate how much you make per pay check.

For example, lets say its a month with 4 pay days in it. Lets say its Friday.

You make individual entries for each Friday.

&#x200B;

When you do get that paycheck, go into that entry of the relevant Friday, enter the amount, and adjust the ""planned amount"" to reflect the actual amount you've gotten.

&#x200B;

The reason you don't wait for the real values to show up is basically so we have numbers to work with to begin with.

&#x200B;

After entering your (estimated) income for the 4 individual Friday's, it will say something along the lines of ""you have this much money left to budget"". Ignore that for now.

&#x200B;

Go to the Housing category and add a entry called ""Apartment Rent"". (Assuming you're renting)

Enter the total amount you pay in rent for a month.

If electricity and water are not included in your went, under that same Housing category, you can make a ""PG&E"" Entry and put in a estimate of how much you pay for those things per month.

&#x200B;

Next up, under a category (it can be ""Health"" if you want), make entries for the estimated amounts you pay in insurance per month.

Renters' Insurance, Earthquake Insurance (if that's relevant to your area), COBRA Health Insurance, etc.

&#x200B;

Now under a category (it can also be under ""Health"" if you'd like), make entries for each reoccurring supplies you buy (per month).

Things like vasaline, body wash, toothbrushes, general supplies like that, that you use.

&#x200B;

Next up, under the ""Food"" category, make entries that are relevant to you.

For example, if you get your food from Walmart, say ""Walmart Food"", if its from Amazon, ""Food ordered from Amazon"", ""Restaurant food and drinks, ""Snacks"", ""Alcohol"", etc.

Put in the estimated respective amounts.

However, beef those numbers up as this category, people tend to on average pay more than they'd expect. So estimate the costs to be higher than what you're currently thinking.

&#x200B;

Under the ""Transportation"" category, put in your estimated costs that are relevant to you. Gas, Bus Fare, BART Fare, etc.

&#x200B;

Do these things with any major cost you need to spend money on that I more than likely forgot to mention in this lengthy post.

&#x200B;

After you've gotten done with all of that, the ""you have so and so amount of money left to spend"" will show you how much money you actually have for wants. Things you don't need, or how much money you actually have left to save into an account, etc.

Your ""liquid money"" so to speak.

If it says something like ""so and so amount OVER BUDGET"" that indicates that there's a financial issue with one of your habits.

&#x200B;

Now that you have a birds eye view of your take home income post costs, you can zero in on issues to dial back certain bad habits.

Like spending too much at Starbucks.

Maybe you need to buy less expensive toothbrushes, etc.

&#x200B;

After you've unfucked your budget to live within your means and stop acting like your resources are infinite, its time for the next phase of unfucking up your life.

&#x200B;

Also another disclaimer I've forgotten to mention at the start. On average, your peers will hate you for improving yourself. That's more than likely because the average person has two options, acknowledge that you're a hard worker, and then subconsciously acknowledge that they chose not to be one, or discount your hard work by being dismissive, toxic, etc. So that they can avoid the former option.

&#x200B;

As long as they're not trying to physically injure you, yes it will hurt emotionally in the short term, but just ignore them.

Odds are they're in a means to do better than you but aren't responsible with their resources, hence why they may be very likely in debt and are in denial that its their fault.

&#x200B;

Just because they (may) earn more than you doesn't mean they can't be in debt.

Like AOC lol.

&#x200B;

To make yourself feel better temporarily to brush off their bullshit, here's what you can do.

Think of manure. Doesn't matter what kind.

Farmers and other individuals may buy manure via money.

&#x200B;

This means manure has a net worth of sorts.

&#x200B;

A person in debt has a negative net worth.

Which means they're financially speaking, literally less than a bag of shit.

&#x200B;

So don't take it to hard if they're attacking you with silly insults. Again ignore them, they literally aren't worth it.

&#x200B;

That side talk side, back to the plan.

For this next step, go to the ""Savings"" category and make a category called ""Cushion"".

&#x200B;

Click on the entry and turn it into a Fund.

What this does is, any money not spent within this entry will carry over into next month's budget.

For example, if there's $350.00 in the Cushion and you spent $50.00 of it, going into next month's budget in February, the Cushion entry will have a balance of $300.00.

&#x200B;

That explanation aside, what the Cushion entry is gonna be used for is as follows.

&#x200B;

Allow you to handle miscellaneous expenses such as a surprise visit to a birthday party.

&#x200B;

You've accidentally went over budget in a category. This is important because the cushion prevents other entries from needing to be cannibalized to compensate.

&#x200B;

Your pay estimation was a few dollars off.

And so on.

&#x200B;

Your ""Planned Amount"" for your Cushion does all of this. Your ""Planned Amount"" is a ""Soft Cushion"".

This should ideally be $150.00 - $350.00 or a little higher or lower depending on many factors such as your living situation's stability, if you're consistent per month with how you spend money (both negatively and positively),

if you're frugal or not, etc.

Use your best guess, as you can get it to be more accurate in future months. Your very first EveryDollar budget is basically just a information gathering month anyways so if this first budget ends up being a wash, you know what to improve on going into the next month.

&#x200B;

""Was the Soft-Cushion (Planned Amount in Cushion entry) too low?"".

""Did I spend too much at Chick-Fil-a?"".

""Did I not budget enough money to cover this month's PG&E bill(s)?"", etc.

&#x200B;

Next is the ""Hard Cushion"".

This is your ""Remaining Balance"" of your Cushion entry going into the next month's budget.

This is extremely important,

this will be how much money you have to start with going into the start of next month.

&#x200B;

So to ""make"" a Hard Cushion, here's what you do.

Figure out how much you spend on transportation or whatever to make it through a typical work week. Including costs of coffee, lunch, etc.

&#x200B;

For your ""Planned Amount"" under the Cushion Entry, add this value you've just figured out on top of the $150.00 - $350.00 that's already there.

For example, if the Soft Cushion was $350.00, and your costs for one work week is $300.00, the Cushion entry's ""Planned Amount"" should now be $650.00.

&#x200B;

Leave that extra $300.00 (or whatever amount you end up rounding up to) alone.

Going into the next month budget, it will say that your Cushion entry's balance will be $300.00.

So you'll have $300.00 in your Checkings Account at the start of said month.

&#x200B;

THIS IS SEPARATE FROM YOUR

Soft Cushion.

So if you're Soft Cushion is under funded, DO NOT cannibalize off of that $300.00 preexisting Balance in said month.

&#x200B;

You can also upgrade your Hard Cushion to be higher if you'd like to pay off rent at the very beginning of the month and still have money to pay for your work week costs as an example.

Its fairly flexible so use your best judgement on how big of a Hard Cushion you want to kick off a month with in your Checkings Account.

&#x200B;

Do note that the Hard Cushion is something you only really have to set up once. After you get the amount you want, you just leave that amount in your budget Balance for the Cushion entry alone and it will automatically carry over into future budgets.

&#x200B;

Another reason why the Hard Cushion is a mandatory thing to do is because what EveryDollar is, is a ""Zero-based budget""ing app. Basically, money utilized = income. So post costs, post putting money into a savings bank account, would result in your Checkings account equally $0.00 at the start of a new month.

&#x200B;

Not counting things you're saving up for.

Speaking of which, next up isn't really part if a plan, its a tool you can use to get things you want responsibly without getting into debt as virtue of being patient, and realistic with how much money you actually have/gain per month.

&#x200B;

This tool is a concept called a ""Sink Fund"".

Here's how it works via a example.

Lets say you want to buy a Sony Xperia 10 mk.iii smartphone.

Lets say the price for a new one is $480.00.

&#x200B;

Go under the ""Personal"" category and make a entry for the Sony Xperia 10 mk.iii. Make that entry a Fund the same way you did with the Cushion entry.

&#x200B;

Now figure out what's the most reasonable amount of time you want one relative to the amount needed to be saved.

Lets say you want it in Christmas as a treat for yourself.

&#x200B;

Assuming we're still on January's budget.

Divide the price of the item you want by the amount of months of that length of time it would take to save up for one.

In this case until December.

So $480.00 divided by 12 months.

You'd get $40.00.

&#x200B;

This value means you'd ideally want to save $40.00 PER MONTH. By December, the amount you will have saved up in your Checkings Account will be $480.00. Enough to get the item you've wanted (not counting misc. things like screen protectors, taxes, etc. I just wanted to give a simple explanation as to what a Sink Fund can do, let alone what it is to begin with).

&#x200B;

So in other words, even if your Hard Cushion is $300.00, it might look like you have more in the Checkings account due to things like Sink Funds happening in the background.

So don't look at that extra amount as an excuse to spend more.

&#x200B;

Sink funds can be used for other things to.

For example, lets say you have Earthquake's Insurance and instead of paying monthly, you opt to pay the insurance company via an annual plan.

Divide that amount by the amount of months between now and the next time you get charged.

&#x200B;

Now you can save up so that when its time to pay up for multiple things at a time, you know damn well you have the money to do so.

&#x200B;

Sink Funds can also be used to save up for things like Christmas Presents for your Squad, saving up for a smartphone upgrade AHEAD OF TIME so when you eventually do upgrade, you already have money set aside for it, etc.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now that we've gotten the basics of your financial foundation settled and cemented, its time to work on the real plan.

Actual step 1 is, under the ""Savings"" category, there should already be a category called ""Emergency Fund"".

&#x200B;

It should already be a Fund but if it isn't, turn that entry into one the same way you did with the Cushion entry from earlier.

&#x200B;

Now here's your first real mission.

Save up $1,000.00 as fast as YOU can into the Emergency Fund.

&#x200B;

If for example the maximum theoretical amount you could get is $300.00 per month but you emotionally need certain things, like hanging out with friends, going to the occasional restaurant, possibly both.

And say your amount you can save per month for the Emergency Fund is now only $150.00.

If it is emotionally sustainable, do it.

You can have your cake and eat it.

Just make sure that cake doesn't make you go over budget for the month and you'll be okay.

&#x200B;

That aside, once you've figured out the amount you can REALISTICALLY get, taking the financial costs of fun into account from keeping you from losing it with this current administration (and people in general lol), keep at it.

Do not reinvent the wheel.

If it works and its SUSTAINABLE, you don't need to modify the plan you got for the next months too much. Just be consistent(ish) and you'll get there.

&#x200B;

Patience is key. Again, if people are scolding you for doing and saving for things like Emergency Funds, brush it off. They're not responsible adults and don't want to be responsible adults either. So don't give in to the bad peer pressure from people with the awfully large egos relative to what they (don't) have.

&#x200B;

For example, that one chronically homeless guy who had all the help in the world, then spent it all on gambling and alcohol. Along with burning the bridges with the people that were trying to help him.

&#x200B;

Remember this and remember this well, some people DON'T want to change for the better (like exercising) or be saved, and make it everyone else's problem.

&#x200B;

Anyways, after dealing with the emotional plus physical external and internal turmoil of this entire process of people choosing to be lame to protect their egos and you doing your best not to smack them across the room, you'll have $1,000.00 in your Emergency Fund.

&#x200B;

If we use gaming logic, this Emergency Fund is your Health Bar. Your Soft Cushion are your Shields/Mana.

Having no Emergency Fund means the smallest inconvenience fucking murders you just by gently grazing you.

&#x200B;

This starter Emergency Fund is there to make sure you don't need to cash out a 401(k), take out a loan, use, credit, for this next step.

&#x200B;

For real step #2, we're gonna do what's called a Debt snowball.

Under the ""Debt"" category, enter entries down for each of your debts from smallest to largest REGARDLESS of interest rates.

The Debt Snowball is famous for being slow but a emotionally reliable way of paying off your debts without dying of a heart attack from stress.

&#x200B;

Again, if people are shitting on you for doing this, remember, they're literally more worthless than a bag of shit so ignore them to the best of your current abilities.

&#x200B;

That aside, after you have your debts. Its time for the next part of real step #2.

&#x200B;

For your smallest debt, pay it off as soon as possible.

&#x200B;

After that one is done, make minimum payments on the second smallest debt, etc.

&#x200B;

Its slow, its boring, but it works.

&#x200B;

After getting debt free, its time for real step #3.

Getting a FULLY FUNDED Emergency Fund of 3 to 6 months of expenses.

For most people its $12,000.00.

Figure out your amount that is 3-6 months worth if expenses for yourself and then we can continue.

&#x200B;

Got your value? Alright, lets begin real step #3.

Its literally just everything we've been doing before with real step #1 and Sink Funds.

Be reasonable so you can sustain your momentum.

&#x200B;

Relatively straight forward and boring step.

You can save a bit more aggressively if you'd like for this step but again, be reasonable.

Moderation in everything.

Work, saving, fun, you name it.

&#x200B;

After very tediously saving and fully funding your 3-6 months big Emergency Fund, its time to do real step #4.

&#x200B;

Go to a bookstore or Amazon, whatever, so long as they have it.

Buy a book called

""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing"" by John C. Bogle.

&#x200B;

Its basically a book hard core backing up the idea that low cost Index Funds are the way to go in the investing world in terms of reliable. Its a bit redundant but it really proves its point.

&#x200B;

Make a Sink Fund to buy it physically if you need to.

&#x200B;

After reading it, its time for real step #5.

Take your newfound (additional) knowledge of index funds and apply them to your 401(k). After setting up which index funds you've chosen to invest in. Invest 15% of your income into your 401(k). No more, no less.

&#x200B;

There's a trick to this to invest your 15% efficiently.

Invest into your 401(k) up to a match.

After that, invest the remainder of that 15% into a ROTH IRA. If it caps off, put the remainder of that 15% back into the traditional 401(k).

&#x200B;

HOWEVER. If your company has something called a ROTH 401(k), you can effectively just dump the entire 15% into there.

&#x200B;

Now leave that retirement fund alone along with the investment value of 15% of your income.

Any less than makes compound interest significantly less effective very quickly.

Any more than 15% of your income will make it impressively impossible to live in the present.

&#x200B;

Again, its a case of, its sustainable, but not unreasonable in terms of profits.

Its, say it with me now,

sustainable.

&#x200B;

Now that you've done all of that, what you do now is up to you.

&#x200B;

However I do have additional miscellaneous tips for you before I go.

&#x200B;

MealSquares are a thing that exists. They're bought in bulks and they check out at about $3.00 per MealSquare.

They have everything necessary nutrition wise.

Vitamin A, B, C, D, calcium, protein, etc.

&#x200B;

So if you find yourself buying McDonalds chicken nuggets constantly, try substituting them for a month to try out MealSquares.

&#x200B;

Secondly tip, despite the stereotypes around it, Soylent is another good healthy food\*(people are still debating that label) that's relatively cheap with how normal people spend on restaurants.

A ready made drink of Soylent is a little under $3.00.

The make it yourself powdered version that you need to mix with water yourself is a little over $1.00 per meal.

&#x200B;

Third and final tip.

Use either Cash or Debit instead of Credit.

&#x200B;

The reasoning behind this is very simple.

The banks effectively sell you on a idea that causes you to spend more money without even realizing.

&#x200B;

This is because there's a visual aspect to it.

If I'm at a restaurant and pay in cash $100.00, I visually see Mr. Franklin's face parting from my hand. He's gone now.

&#x200B;

Take that same scenario but with a Debit Card.

I pay $100 but I visually see I am getting my card back. But my bank account immediately deducts the value out of my Checkings Account.

So I still ""see"" that I've just spent money.

&#x200B;

Credit Cards are toxic because visually, I get my card back, AND my Checkings Account doesn't deduct immediately.

&#x200B;

Another major reason they're detrimental to your financial health is with the concept of cash back.

The bank basically just sold you on the concept that ""if I spend money, I can save money"".

&#x200B;

It being a percentage means you subconsciously try to spend more so you ""save more"".

This also doubly manipulates you by seeming like you're getting free money. When in reality, the banks are banking on you to over spend by ""spending more to save more"", subconsciously manipulating you because it makes you seem richer than you actually are as you have no IMMEDIATE feedback that you've just spent any money.

&#x200B;

Also just think about the values for example.

Lets say 1.5% cash back.

If you spent $1,000.00 you get $15.00 back.

The alternative being not spending that $1,000.00 and put it into a Savings Account.

&#x200B;

With all that said, you should be gucci from here on out. If there's anything else you need, you now know how to pay for those needs

AND, your wants.

So from here on out its up to you what your next goal will be.

&#x200B;

Its your choice.

It often seems to represents the same patriarchal sexualization of women and the exaggeration of caricatures of feminine characteristics/tropes. It feels as though it’s typically cis men to me, where this feels the most painful.

A capitalist way to address capitalist problems,Conservative,9,qu99jt,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/qu99jt/a_capitalist_way_to_address_capitalist_problems/,10,"Most of you on here are not a big fan of taxes and understandably so. A fact that far too few leftists are willing to acknowledge is that just about every tax carries a deadweight loss. At the same time, we still need the government to pay for basic essentials like infrastructure, law enforcement, and military expenses.

Furthermore, we are seeing rising housing costs which are keeping today's young people from being able to afford to own homes like generations before.

So what's the solution?

In order to really be able to discuss solutions, we need to understand just where the problem comes from.

To do that, we need to understand the three factors of production.

Labor: effort by man

Capital: Most goods fall under here

Land: Any good in fixed supply like land, space, portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and geostationary orbits. While labor and capital have a potentially unlimited potential, land, being fixed in supply, cannot be increased.

Profit is likewise split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land). The traditional American idea is that by working harder, you improve your living standards while also benefitting society. There are two economic activities which benefit society - labor and investment. The former is typically what most people mean when they say work hard but investment can potentially take you much further than the former. That's why business owners and C-level people make so much money. And this is probably the biggest issue with Marx's labor theory of value. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't state that labor is the only thing which grows the economy but rather that labor is the only productive economic activity. Land and capital most certainly exist but they take on passive roles according to Marx. The factors of production, according to marxian economics, are labor, subjects of labor (land), and tools of labor (capital). According to the LTV, all goods and services derive their worth from labor costs (more specifically, socially necessary labor). The problem with the LTV is that it ignores investment as a way to contribute to the economy. Compared to labor, investment is less effort and more risk. Half of all businesses fail within the first five years with 20% failing in the first year. Some socialists go yet even further and state that all labor is worth the same with the only differential factor being number of hours worked. Just to be clear here, Marx himself did not believe this but others like Pierre Joseph Proudhon did. Proudhon proposed the idea of labor notes. The problem with this idea becomes obvious when you consider the disparity in skill required to become a janitor vs a brain surgeon. If everyone were paid the same, there would be a significant disparity in high skill labor.

This is probably the best video against socialism because it undermines the idea that labor alone creates wealth.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jUSDgolz7g&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jUSDgolz7g&t)

Which brings us to the big issue. You see, there's a form of investing that doesn't create wealth called speculation. If you buy an artwork for $150 only to later sell it for a million dollars because people now know that it was painted by someone noteworthy, you just made money without contributing to society. This isn't to say that speculation is entirely bad. In a volatile goods market, speculation can help to stabilize prices. But in markets where demand is rising faster than supply, speculation becomes easy. Markets with inelastic supply are particularly prone to this. One example is with artworks. With the kinds of artworks that sell for millions of dollars, most of their worth isn't in the artwork itself but in who painted it. Because these artworks are limited in supply and there's always someone who wants the original, they will sell for a lot of money.

It's in land that we see the pernicious effects of speculation. As you're starting to see, rent is unearned, unlike interest and wages because they reward the owner for essentially doing nothing. You might say the same with any investment since it grows passively. But the difference between investing in land and other things is that the growth in land value does not benefit society as a whole unlike growth in a business. Now obviously this doesn't mean that real estate investment is a scam. But there are differences. Real estate development creates capital. Buying land in the hopes that it will be worth more in the future does not generate any wealth. Land is in fixed supply giving it a perfectly inelastic supply. When it comes to demand, land is also pretty inelastic because we need land to live and work on. As a result, the amount that is charged for the selling and renting of land is pretty close to what people are willing to pay.

Land speculation is attractive because it offers a good reward with less risk when compared to other forms of investment such as starting a business or buying stocks. This is perhaps one of the reasons why housing is in short supply. Another reason is because municipal governments implement zoning codes which help prevent land from being used at its economic potential. This is a huge problem in the Bay Area where demand far outstrips supply. For a super liberal area, San Francisco does a terrible job of ensuring housing for all.

The good news is that there is a way to solve this issue. Meet the land value tax (LVT). The LVT is similar to a property tax except it only taxes the land rather than the improvements. Thus making improvements to your home will not give you a higher LVT. The LVT penalizes land speculation and incentivizes efficient use of land, making the LVT have a positive effect on the economy. If implemented at the state or federal level, it could also force municipal jurisdictions to rezone as the same people who push against new development would have no choice but to get them to change their zoning codes.

This idea is nothing new, it dates back to Henry George from the late 19th century. In *Progress and Poverty*, George detailed how land rent was the big issue with capitalism. His solution was the LVT. The idea was to raise the tax as high as it possibly could and use the surplus revenue to hand back to society in the form of a basic income. George was also pro free trade and was skeptical of intellectual property since that effectively granted a monopoly to the IP holder.

The idea dates back even further to Adam Smith who pointed out that land rent is unearned. Therefore, it's only fair for the government to raise revenue from taxing land value. Thomas Paine had a similar proposal to George in which land value would be taxed with 2/3 of proceeds being distributed to those over 50 (back then the average life expectancy) and the remaining third given to those under 50.

Milton Friedman considered the LVT to be the least bad tax

[https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/08/09/the-time-may-be-right-for-land-value-taxes)

One objection to the LVT is that it would put land in the hands of the government. My rebuttal is that the same could be said for any tax. An income tax is the government claiming ownership over your labor (i.e. slavery). By that logic, a property tax puts all municipal property under the ownership of the city government. If you still think that the LVT is socialist, perhaps you ought to learn what actual socialists thought of the idea such as Karl Marx. In short, socialists like Marx didn't like George because the latter was going after land rent while leaving capital alone.

[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81\_06\_20.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81_06_20.htm)

Another objection is that this will negatively affect farmers. It's easy to think this because farmers grow stuff out of the ground, therefor the LVT will be punitive. However, you have to remember that we're talking about a land value tax, not a mere land tax. This means that land in better locations will be valued more than those in more remote locations. In other words, land near the city center would be taxed at a much higher rate than land in the rural areas. If the LVT would hit any sector of the economy the hardest, it would probably be big retainers with their massive parking lots.

The third objection is that renters won't really benefit because landlords will simply shift the cost onto tenants. But as mentioned before, renters are already paying close to what they would be willing to pay (assuming there's no rent control). In other words, landlords can't raise rents because they would have otherwise done so already. For some reason, we don't assume this about other taxes. If we lower taxes, people have more spending power, therefore, landlords raise rents because people can now afford to pay more.

In conclusion, the LVT is a conservative solution to the housing crisis and to taxation because it will benefit the economy and make it easier for the younger generation to achieve the American dream.",1636954945.0

This clause was changed by Blair in 1994 removing any reference to common ownership or democratic control. Of course there are still many in the party that wish to reintroduce a new clause 4, Labour4Clause4 offer a new clause 4 which is more closely aligned with the original. 

“We stand for the inherent rights of all people to useful work, good homes, education, health care and dignity in retirement, free from all forms of discrimination. We believe that these rights cannot be fully realised under capitalism where human values are subordinated to the demand for profit. Our aim is to abolish the obstacles to the realisation of those aspirations. As a socialist party, we do not exist to manage capitalism. We aim to bring about a fundamental transformation of society, which will give to everyone a chance to live a full and satisfying life. We will adopt the means necessary for that purpose by, amongst other things, the common ownership, under democratic control and management by working people, of the commanding heights of the economy, including the banks and finance houses, the land and all the companies which dominate our economy. We stand for a democratic socialist society based upon the principle from each according to their ability to each according to their need.”

A few notes: Party factions are very loose and informal in Portugal, so the reality is a little bit more complicated than I make it out to be. Also, some details of the electoral programs may be fuzzy since I haven't actually read them and I'm just going off what I heard in the debates and on social media and newspaper articles.

\--------

The 2022 Portuguese legislative election will happen on 30 January, and with no party projected to win a majority and the left and right camp showing up very close in election polls, the results are anyone’s guess.

**Current situation**

For the past six years the country has been governed by the centre-left Socialist Party (PS) with the support of left-wing populist Left Bloc (BE) and the predominantly Marxist-Leninist Unitary Democratic Coalition (comprising the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) and their ally, the Ecologist Party “The Greens” (PEV)). This political arrangement, which for the first four years took the form of a written confidence-and-supply agreement but since 2019 has worked on the basis case-by-case negotiations, is called “Geringonça”. The term means literally “contraption” in Portuguese, and was coined by the centre-right former Deputy Prime Minister Paulo Portas who said “this is not a government, this is a contraption,” but has since been appropriated by leftists as a marker of pride. 

Despite many controversies a good number of ups and downs, the government has retained good public favourability since taking office, mostly due to the popular reversal of the previous (centre-right) government’s austerity measures and good economic results in the pre-pandemic period. 

However, things came crumbling down in late 2021 when the two smaller left-wing parties voted against the government’s 2022 budget proposal. The negotiations were expected to be tough from the start, so the PS tried to win over the other parties by committing to greatly increase public spending. The end result was the most left-wing budget proposal in a very long time. Still, the BE and PCP remained unconvinced, not so much because of anything in the budget itself, but more because of the government's refusal to negotiate other matters in tandem with the budget. Among other things, they wanted to raise the minimum wage to a higher value than the government was willing to consider and they wanted a complete and immediate reversal of the previous government's labour reforms. The PS was scared that if they gave in that could jeopardise the covid crisis recovery and, most importantly, make EU sanctions a likely prospect again.

The government did not resign after the budget was rejected, but President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa decided to dissolve the Assembly of the Republic and schedule new elections for January.

For months, it appeared that the PS had a very solid lead, polling 14 points ahead of its former rival, the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD). This lead, however, has largely evaporated at this point, and its now unclear what party will come first as well as whether there will be a left-wing majority or a right-wing one. Overall, the situation appears quite discouraging for the left, as even in the most optimistic scenarios their majority is bound to be greatly reduced, mostly due to a drop in support for the two smaller parties in that camp. At the same, on the right, not only is the PSD expected two growth, but two recently founded political parties, the right-libertarian Liberal Initiative and the right-wing populist CHEGA (Portuguese for Enough), both of which elected only 1 deputy in the last election, are set to become major political forces, creating the possibility of a “right-wing Geringonça” as already happens in the Azores regional government. 

**Political and Electoral system**

Portugal is a semi-presidential republic with a strong lean towards parliamentarism. The Prime Minister is the head of the executive branch, and while he is technically nominated by the President of the Republic (who in theory can appoint whoever they want), governments cannot do anything without the confidence of the unicameral Assembly of the Republic. Thus, effectively, whoever has a majority in the Assembly is who gets to govern. 

The Assembly has 230 seats distributed by 22 multi-member geographic electoral constituencies and elections use the D’Hondt method of Proportional Representation. Due to populational imbalances, the districts vary widely in terms of seat numbers, ranging from 48 in Lisbon District to only 2 in Portalegre District.

**Political parties**

(Ordered by current seat numbers)

**Socialist Party (PS -** ***Partido Socialista*****)**: Founded in the 1970s by disaffected ex-communists, the Socialist Party is currently Portugal’s main centre-left party, with an ideology based on social democracy and democratic socialism. They were initially far more radical during the immediate post-Carnation revolution period, with their economic program being nigh-undistinguishable from that of the communists. By the late 70s and early 80s, however, they had completely abandoned these greater ambitions, and like many other European centre-left parties began drifting towards the right, culminating in a centrist “Third Way” period in the 1990s and 2000s. A new left-turn was initiated in late 2014, when the centrist-leaning party leader António José Seguro was ousted by António Costa, Mayor of Lisbon and a member of the party’s more left-wing faction. At a time when most social democratic parties in Europe were experiencing a steep decline, Costa’s PS stayed afloat by embracing the anti-austerity movement when it was still in its peak. Thus, in the 2015 legislative election, although the ruling right-wing coalition came first, there was a solid left-wing majority due to solid growth from all four parties and Costa was able to form the first “Geringonça” government. Despite the eventual collapse of this government solution, the party has maintained its left-wing message in the lead up to the election, calling for increased public spending, a moderate increase of the minimum wage and retaining a sceptical stance towards public private partnerships in the national health service. 

Current factions:

· **Costa’s wing:** Centred around the Prime Minister and his key allies, they are descended from the traditional left-wing of the party, called the “Sampaístas” after their first leader, former Mayor of Lisbon and President of the Republic Jorge Sampaio, who was critical of the party’s rightwards drift and mentored many young leftist politicians during the 1980s and 90s. They’re a “pragmatic” leftist faction, emphasizing a strong progressive agenda but willing to make compromises to guarantee financial stability and maintain the trust of the EU.

· **The hard left:** A more radical left-wing faction currently led by the Minister of Transport, Housing and Infrastructure Pedro Nuno Santos. Generally younger than Costa’s allies and with left-wing populist positions similar to those found in the parties to the left of the PS, they were the incorrigible “enfants terribles” until they were elevated to key government positions during the first Geringonça government. Sometimes called “the Bloc-in-the-PS” or “the right-wing of the PCP”, they were crucial to keeping the left together during the last 6 years and are now seen as having amassed enough influences that Pedro Nuno Santos is a likely contender to succeed Costa as party leader.

· **Right-wing remnants**: Once the dominant wing of the party, they are now a shadow of their former selves, kept out of key party and government positions by their more left-wing colleagues, but they’re still around and follow the same centrist line as they always have.

**Social Democratic Party (PSD –** ***Partido Social Democrata*****):** Also founded in the 1970s, the PSD is often called Portugal’s main centre-right party, but in reality it’s a rather odd beast. Their founders were liberal Catholics who, for a while, had formed the only above ground opposition to the fascist Estado Novo regime, but despite this background they initially rejected a liberal or Christian democratic inclination and instead proclaimed their intention to emulate other wester European social democratic parties, with the German SPD frequently cited as an example to emulate. However, their Catholicism couples with a strong anti-communist and anti-collectivization stance made them the party of smallholders and the rural north, and also the party of white-collar workers and small business owners. This led them to gradually drift towards the right, eventually evolving into a majority liberal-conservative party. However, it remains highly factionalized and there are many in the party who still see it as centrist or even centre-left. It led the government between 2012 and 2015 under prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho, putting in place draconian austerity measures to combat the ongoing financial crises and implementing wide-ranging liberalizing changes to the economy. While supporters claimed that these measures saved the country from bankruptcy, they were widely unpopular and led to the left-wing upset in 2015. Current leader Rui Rio, a self-described centrist who purports to take the social democratic label seriously and would be centre-left in many people’s books, was a strong critic of his predecessor and has sought to distance the party from his legacy. However, the influence of the remaining “Passistas” coupled with the need to compete with the new right-wing parties has forced the PSD to retain a rather right-wing outlook on some issues despite its moderate leadership. The party’s election program calls for tax cuts on corporations, increasing the number of public private partnerships in healthcare and more fiscal restraint. Knowing that they are unlikely to form a government without the new right-wing parties, they have shown willingness to consider some of their ideas, though how many and to what extent remains to be seen.

Current factions:

· **Rio’s wing:** Centrist social democrats who seek to distance the party from its recent legacy of hard-line austerity and free market fundamentalism. They also tend to be more socially liberal than the rest of the party, having largely accepted abortion and most of the recent strides in LGBT rights (though not all) and even favouring the legalization of euthanasia. They were initially a small minority faction that mostly just happened to stumbled on the leadership, but have now increased their grip on the party apparatus after Rio successfully thwarted two consecutive leaderships challenges from more right-wing party members and then proceeded to purge their supporters.

· **Passistas:** Devout followers of the former Prime minister, who they see as having saved the country and paved the way to a more economically free Portugal with less irresponsible public spending and less government intervention in the economy. Generally more conservative on social issues like most of the party.

· **The old guard:** As the name indicates, mostly older politicians who have been in politics since the 70s and 80s, like the current President of the Republic Marcelo Rebelo the Sousa. Social Democratic on economics but very socially conservative for the most part.

· **The Madeiran wing:** A group of regionalist politicians from the island of Madeira, a PSD stronghold where the party has controlled the regional government since the 1970s. They have only loose ties to the national party and care mostly for furthering their region’s interests. Generally strongly opposed to economic liberalism, with their former leader of over 40 years Alberto João Jardim derisively calling the national party “Chicago boys” and telling them to stop having so many “funny ideas”. They are known negotiating with PS governments for parliamentary support in exchange for increased investment in Madeira.

**Left Bloc (BE - Bloco de Esquerda):** The BE was founded in the 1990s through the merger of the Maoist-Hoxhaist People’s Democratic Union, the Trotskyist Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Eurocommunist Politics XXII. If that sounds like an enormous mess, that’s because it is, and it explains why the party has a new split about every year or so. Nevertheless, the party has been very successful in uniting the former anti-soviet left and became Portugal’s main anti-austerity left-wing populist party during the recession era, attracting a large portion of the country’s millennials. While generally seen as positioned to the left of the PS and to the right of the PCP on most issues, this can vary depending on how factional politics go, and for the past two years they have taken a more hardline position than that of the communists. The party is soft-Eurosceptic, opposing Portuguese withdrawal from the Union but favouring a strong stance against EU-mandated austerity measures.

**Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU – Coligação Democrática Unitária):** A coalition of the Portuguese Communist party (PCP) and the Ecologist Party “The Greens” (PEV). The PCP is the oldest political party in Portugal (founded in 1916!) and the only one to survive (in clandestinely) the authoritarian Estado Novo regime, to which it formed the most effective opposition. They were popular (if highly divisive) during the immediate post-revolutionary period, especially in the southern rural region of Alentejo (where they led the push for land reform and for the end of the brutal latinfundia system) and in the industrial areas and fishing villages immediately south of river Tagus. Until very recently, they held a monopoly on local government in these regions, but this is gradually coming to an end due to the increasing popularity of the now more left-wing PS among traditionally communist voters coupled with the fact that the party’s most loyal supporters are now very old and dying out. The decline of the party’s local government machine has been blamed for its recent hardline turn which spelled the end of the Geringonça. The communist politicians with experience in local government are generally more moderate and technocratic, and their change in fortunes has made the party more dependent on its other main support base, the trade unions, who are unlikely to budge on minimum wage and labour laws. Ideologically, the party remains committed to Marxism-Leninism and generally defends the legacy of the Soviet Union as well as currently existing nominally left-wing authoritarian regimes (the reasons given for that can range from “solidarity with our comrades” to “we disagree with them but they have the right to self-determination""), but in practice they usually advocate only for workers rights and social democratic policies, which they see as the first step in a long process towards the construction of socialism. They are the most socially conservative of all left-wing parties but still liberal for the most part, supporting abortion and LGBT rights while opposing euthanasia and being strongly against drugs, pornography, and prostitution. They are also hard Eurosceptics who want Portugal to leave the EU.

As for the Greens, they are usually seen as a puppet party of the communists, but in reality they have full freedom to vote as they please in parliament and occasionally break from their partners on social issues (being more consistently liberal) as well as in environmental protection (their main focus which the PCP is sometimes less enthusiastic about when it generates trouble for communist-controlled local governments).

**Democratic Social Centre – People’s Party (CDS-PP - Centro Democrático Social – Partido Popular):** Originally a centrist and Christian democratic party, the CDS was Portugal’s sole non-socialist political party during the early years of our democracy, even voting against the 1976 constitution for its socialist language, which to this day they seek to remove. Since the 1980s, the party wavered back and forth between positioning itself to the right of the PSD and in the centre of the political spectrum, with the former having become the default position in recent years after much of old guard abandoned the party. Traditionally the third or fourth largest party, they are now in steep decline due to competition from the newer right-wing party and may find themselves out of parliament for the first time.

**People-Animals-Nature (PAN – Pessoas-Animais-Natureza):** Previously a single-issue animal rights party, the PAN has gradually broadened its platform to include general environmentalism and a generally centre-left economic agenda (although it calls itself neither left or right). They generally occupy the same space as green parties in other European countries (which our actual green party can’t do because it’s so close to the communists). Their platform includes shutting down all remaining coal stations as quickly as possible, opposing intensive agriculture, introducing alternative medicine to the national healthcare service and a full ban on bullfighting. They were recently perceived as being on the rise until recently, but party leader’s Inês Sousa Real’s recent scandals (turns out she practices intensive agriculture herself despite being against it), coupled with their unwillingness to say if they’d rather back a left-wing or right-wing government and a lobbying offensive by the Portuguese Agricultural Confederation and pro-bullfighting groups has weakened them. 

**CHEGA (*****Enough*****):** While for a long time it appeared that Portugal had dodged the right-wing populist wave that had taken Europe by storm, this was proven premature in 2019, when CHEGA won a seat in parliament. Since then, the party has seen a meteoric rise at the polls and is now projected to become the third largest political form, with somewhere between 5 and 10% of the vote. They are somewhat of a one-man party, very dependent on the cult of personality of its charismatic leader André Ventura. Formerly a tax inspector and sports commentators, Ventura first came to national attention as the social democratic candidate for Loures (a left-wing stronghold) in 2017. During the campaign, while talking about the need for better fiscalization of welfare beneficiaries, he accidentally commented that irregularities occurred “mainly in gypsies”, drawing in accusations of anti-ziganism. While this was unpopular with the press, it proved extremely popular with the public, and Ventura rode on a wave of anti-Roma sentiment and finished a respectable second place in race (the best result ever for a right-wing candidate in Loures). His political career in the PSD was finished, but he wasted no time in reinventing himself as the Portuguese Le Pene or Salvini. After making it into parliament, his popularity skyrocketed and now it’s unlikely there will ever be a right-wing government without him. CHEGA runs on a populist platform emphasizing anti-immigration policies, welfare reductions (especially for immigrants and Romani), law and order politics and tougher penalties for corrupt politicians. On the other hand, it is also very economically liberal, with policies including flat tax and privatisations, which allows it to gain significant corporate backing.

**Liberal Initiative (IL - Iniciativa Liberal):** A classical liberal and right-libertarian party favouring both economic and social liberalism. Promising to “dismantle socialism in Portugal” and to “make it more like liberal countries which have better salaries,” they advocate dramatic tax cuts, a flat income tax, mass privatization, a multi-payer healthcare system to replace the current payer one, a school vouchers program and the abandonment of Portugal’s free college model in favour of a system of government loans. It was also the only party to consistently oppose most covid measures. They are extremely popular among right-leaning members of the Y and Z generations and may become the fourth largest party after the next election.

**LIVRE (*****Free*****):** The most successful Left Bloc split so far, LIVRE was founded by former MEP Rui Tavares. It presents itself as a “middle of the road leftist party” not being quite centre-left but not quite far-left either. They are strong supporters of leftist unity and seek to join a new Geringonça after the next election (preferably with all other left-wing parties, but possibly just with some). They are strongly environmentalist and were the first to bring to Portuguese politics the idea of a universal basic income. Unlike the BE and PCP, they are also strongly pro-European and part of the DiEM25 movement. They elected one deputy in 2019, but she split from the party after only a few weeks, leaving them without parliamentary representation. While the party fell into obscurity for a long time after that, their 2019 result allowed leader Rui Tavares to attend the 2022 debates, where he gained exposure and his performance was lauded by the press, so they are likely to elect at least on deputy, if not much more.",1643199035.0

It makes sense to me that in the short-term the price would reflect the subjective value placed on it, but in the long-run (in a perfectly competitive market) the price would only reflect the marginal cost.

Say a consumer values a banana at 10 utils. He goes to the market and finds only one banana vendor, selling them for 8 utils. Let's say the cost of producing a banana is 1 util. In the short-term the vendor can price disciriminate and maximize profits, but in the long-term more firms are attracted to the profit-rich market. Unless the firms collude (and assuming they sell an identical product), wouldn't there be a race to the bottom to out-compete the competition, with the market price ultimately falling until it hits marginal cost at which point no firm could go lower and still make a profit?

"Should certain essential industries be ""exempt"" from the collective bargaining process?

Or having workers and employer negotiate regulations through interest groups (e.g. unions) with government oversight. This has been accomplished from social democratic countries like Norway and Sweden to more right-wing interventionist countries like South Korea and Singapore.

 I agree that this is ideal, but what of *essential industries* where such a thing could produce disaster? For example, the recent trucker's strike in Canada will likely make the supply chain mess we're enduring *worse,* and even if these truckers have valid claims they must continue to work or else *people will actually go hungry.* Similarly, I can't see collective bargaining happening in, say, ***arms manufacturing.***

I could see institutionalizing such conflicts through committees working - wage councils, employment forums, safety boards, etc. - as that's the method of tripartitism abroad. But this leads me to another question... 

Sometimes ***one side needs to win.*** And it's not always the workingman who needs to win. I'm sure most people here are pro-vaccine mandates, which is what the truckers in Canada are protesting if my analysis is correct. So naturally, the government should side with the employers who carry out the mandate. 

There's also the case of the UAW in the 60s and 70s, which demanded so much in wages and benefits that production costs were too high for automobiles - making such an essential product unaffordable for the commons.

Thoughts on the Difficulty of a Libertarian movement in the US,Conservative,6,surjmr,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/surjmr/thoughts_on_the_difficulty_of_a_libertarian/,12,"This is a follow up to a comment I made on a post about property rights.

Consider for a moment why we have rights.

Rights seem self evident, they seem to justify themselves, there is no need for religious or moral arguments for things like free speech, freedom of the press, due process of law etc. but why do we have these things?

The answer is that we have rights, and a need to exercise them when we do things that others do not want us to do.

Who exercises free speech? We all do, but we only discuss the **right** to freedom of speech when people say contentious things about large groups of people who get mad about it. Consider the Westboro Baptist Church, they are almost always mentioned in Free Speech discussions, and why? They do things which a lot of people disagree with (admittedly, many do agree with them).

In terms of property for example, if a libertarian party advocated for stronger individual property rights, that is quite agreeable.

But consider on a local scale, some neighbors advocating for increased property rights would likely come at the detriment of some other person in that neighborhood. One  person saying ""I want the right to start a business at my home without government intervention"" and that persons neighbor might say ""I want to live in a neighborhood which is free from the busyness which a business brings"".

Both of these people would like their individual rights recognized and vindicated, yet if either person got their rights vindicated, it would come at the detriment of the other.

So a libertarian advocating for more property rights in general gets into a bit of a pickle, who's rights are better? Do we just ask the entire neighborhood? What of the neighbor who does not get their way, they have been deprived of something they desire simply due to his local majority opinion, and perhaps that is how democracy is supposed to work.

I do quite like this sub, I think we have great discussions here and I believe that we all have each others interests in mind, regardless of your tilt to the ""left"" or ""right"", but I have come to a conclusion that if we want to create a movement with a focus on individual liberty, we must prioritize something beyond just vindicating individual rights and the free market. I do not know what that thing is, or should be, and perhaps the idea of a focused, institutional goal is against what some believe libertarianism is all about.  I invite suggestions and other thoughts. I just feel that in today's society, solutions to our problems are not as always as simple as shortening the arms government. Though, if somebody can suggest otherwise I would be happy to hear",1645112005.0

I got bullied for my weight, but I was not the only fat kid in the school. Somehow it was easier to be mean to the fat kid with cheap clothes than to be mean to the fat kid with expensive ones. I got bullied for my appearance - short hair clipped back by plastic hair clips, with bangs that made my face look fatter, wearing baggy checkered shirts that were handed down by my brother, and paired with my then favorite animal print long skirts. The memory that haunts me the most is when I was browsing through someone’s birthday scrapbook, and I found a picture of myself, taken without my consent or knowledge, likening my baggy long skirt to that of a cheap, colorful Indian wedding tent on poles.

Anyways, for some backstory, she's an associate manager for a local grocery store. I asked her how she's doing with supply-chain and labor issues, which is when I learned some questionable things about her hiring and supplier practises.

Regarding suppliers, she expresses an unforgiving nature when an order is but a few hours late. Apparently she is quick to source new suppliers, instead of starting dialogue with her current ones when they're having issues that no one can help. She said that she made no demands on them when they could not give her the kind of service she needed, and instead found someone who could. 

Regarding labor, she says that it is not difficult to judge which employees will succeed and which won’t. She prefers young people, especially those with rich parents. In her view, it's more likely that an employee with rich parents will have a more reliable vehicle, and be more likely to pursue education outside of the liberal arts, which brings up another thing- she actually avoids the more educated... I'm thinking that she's intimidated by them, and I'm unsure how she believes she'll succeed if she shields herself from the newest ideas and worldviews...

What's more, she's trying to start new businesses with her earnings, and she tells me that if an applicant for a loan ever mentioned his personal need or any personal feeling whatever, the interview ended and he was never given another chance to speak to her...

I'm writing here because I'm concerned about the rate at which she's spreading her ruthless and illiberal tendencies. Help!",1643755645.0

The 99 Percent Economy on updating Monetary Socialism for the 21st Century (on Paul Adler's work),Liberal,2,swrhwo,alltheleft,https://www.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/swrhwo/the_99_percent_economy_on_updating_monetary/,1,"[The 99 Percent Economy
How Democratic Socialism Can Overcome the Crises of Capitalism by Paul S. Adler](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_99_Percent_Economy/ZjGoDwAAQBAJ)

In the work above, Paul Adler makes the case for a monetary form of socialism in the 21st century.  Relevant excerpts are below:

> We should expect enormous opposition to this socialization of property from the current private owners. To compensate the current owners—including all working people whose savings had been tied up in stocks, bonds, and land—**the government will issue long- term annuities.**

[...]

> This ring will include some entire industries, **such as banking and finance**, telecommunications, public transportation, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, energy, automobile, steel, aluminum, and the defense industrial base.

[...]

> And any external financing of these [smaller private] enterprises will come from banks, which, being now publicly owned, will use our democratically determined strategic criteria to **make credit-allocation decisions**.

[...]

> We will encourage these [publicly-owned] enterprises to compete on quality and service by **setting a common price for their services**. (If we allowed competition on price, we would be creating a powerful incentive to squeeze labor, and that would be contrary to our goals.)

[...]

> Financial incentives are a second tool. **We will offer workers a collective bonus** that rewards them if their enterprise achieves high output but also penalizes them if their output is either below or above the target. This will help ensure that the economic councils are receiving good information from the enterprises about their capabilities.

[...]

> The consumer banks will operate like savings and loans associations, **paying interest on savings and charging interest on consumer loans**.

All this is in accordance with an outline of a monetary form of socialism provided in *The Social Revolution* by Karl Kautsky, *when he was a Marxist*:

https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1902/socrev/pt2-1.htm

> I speak here of the wages of labor. What, it will be said, will there be wages in the new society? Shall we not have abolished wage labor and money? How then can one speak of the wages of labor? These objections would be sound if the social revolution proposed to immediately abolish money. I maintain that this would be impossible. Money is the simplest means known up to the present time which makes it possible in as complicated a mechanism as that of the modern productive process, with its tremendous far-reaching division of labor, to secure the circulation of products and their distribution to the individual members of society. It is the means which makes it possible for each one to satisfy his necessities according to his individual inclination (to be sure within the bounds of his economic power). As a means to such circulation money will be found indispensable until something better is discovered.",1645327286.0

For example who does it apply to ? Humans are pretty obvious. But what about animals that display some form of intelligence, social behavior and the ability to feel pain. A good example would be orcas or crows. If only the ability to feel pain counts it would have to apply to pretty much every living thing with a central nervous system.

Or how to deal with property that is the result of the violation of the NAP ? In a pure interpretation property which is the result of a violation of the NAP should not exist. However that would include pretty much all land that is owned by anyone.

I'm a 20 year old american man. Looking at the state of shit right now I am just fucking furious (sorry this is gonna be a bit of a rant).

Yesterday, Russia, a massive country with a huge fucking military, invaded relatively tiny Ukraine for the great ""sin"" of existence. Civilians have been killed, and Ukraine will probably fall to Russian forces, most likely seeing a new pro-russian government installed in Kiev.

Not too long ago, the Afghan government fell to the Taliban. Once again, women are forced into subjugation, brutal punishments, all for the ""sin"" of reading and educating themselves. They must once again wear veils regardless of their consent. Musicians have had their instruments destroyed, innocent people beaten in the streets all in the name of a hard right fascist ideology that attempts to ""justify"" itself by slandering other muslims around the world. And of course, the Taliban endorsing child brides. Meanwhile, Taliban leaders send their own daughters to schools abroad. Rules for thee but not for me...

But hell, even the Afghan government the US installed was deeply corrupt and problematic. It spent 20 years effectively robbing the Afghan people. There was an acronym used to describe the government in Afghanistan: VICE (Vertically Integrated Criminal Organization). It ran protection rackets, took bribes, regularly ""lost money"" due to corruption, etc. Hell, I remember reading in some leaked US military papers that Taliban checkpoints were more popular than that national government's because when you had to pay a bribe to the Taliban to cross, they gave you a ticket so other Taliban checkpoints would know you paid, whereas the national government didn't. The corruption of the Afghan government was extreme, and I am not surprised it fell so quickly as it was basically only propped up by the Americans. If I remember correctly, they reported having several thousand more troops than they actually had. And troops themselves were deeply under equipped. Like they literally had to buy coats for themselves level under equipped. Why? Because higher ups sold off material meant for troops on the black market. And now that America has left, the Taliban has taken over. From one deeply corrupt and basically criminal government, to an all out authoritarian fascist regime. How fucking tragic.

That's not even to mention what amounts to an illegal invasion of Iraq on the part of the US thanks to the lies of the Bush administration.

Or the collapse of the resistance to Assad

Or Europe's response to the Syrian Refugee crisis

Or American support of the war in Yemen

Or Russian support of Assad and Lukashenko

Or American abandonment of the Kurds under Trump

At home, Nazis march in the streets and praise the Taliban and Russia for their brutal and aggressive actions. Trans people face increasing discrimination and crackdowns, book burnings take place in the name of ""free speech"". Fears of authoritarianism in America are on the rise as the right actively embraces and praises authoritarian leaders and practices. White Christian Nationalism has come to dominate the right in america and any who don't fit that mold are fucked. Increases in hate crimes against trans people, jewish people, asian americans, etc all took place. Meanwhile, we block refugees from countries where we fucking created the problem (Afghanistan) because, as Fucker Carlson put it, ""First we invade, and then we are invaded"", just gotta add on a little Great Replacement Theory on top of that don't you? On top of that, we have increased voter suppression, increased violence from right wing domestic terror groups (who does it target I wonder....)

Meanwhile, the democrats are too scared to do anything substantial. I mean hell, what happened to student loan cancellation that would definitely help dems win in 2022? What big changes have we got that will alter the election landscape for the democrats? I mean honestly, what hope do we have in 2022. Right now we have all of Congress and the Presidency. If shit doesn't get done before the midterms the Republicans will probably retake the Senate if not the House, and then they will continue enacting voter restriction on the state level as the federal government is unable to do anything thanks to partisan gridlock, and then we have another green bay sweep:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RykP-UkJ86k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RykP-UkJ86k), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaIuv5uG7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaIuv5uG7Y). And all because what? People are mad that they can't be racist assholes anymore? So we have to give up fucking DEMOCRACY?

I am genuinely pissed and scared. I once thought a dictator would never come to power in America. To be honest, I am starting to believe it is basically inevitable. At this point, I am kinda expecting America to turn into an illiberal democracy a la Hungary, some proto-fascist state.

Around the world, democracies are falling and autocracy and fascism are on the rise. And I am sitting here watching it happen.

I just so fucking angry and I don't feel like I have an outlet for it. I protested some, but it doesn't feel like enough, or it's not doing anything. Don't get me wrong, it felt good to shout down fascist scum, but at the same time it doesn't feel like enough. Idk man, what do i do with this anger? How do I personally fight these trends?

The people I see criticized in leftist circles follow a trend. The billionaires, of course, get daily 24/7 ire and outrage from leftists, which is understandable and, frankly, the only humane conclusion one can when looking at our world today. The old money who keep the fossil fuel profiteers' dominance over the rest of the world also strike dread even to the point of occasional hopelessness for the future of humanity.

But what about those who are in a position to stand up against exploitation, but choose not to? For example, the movie industry is heavily unionized. Those beautiful faces so many know and love so much got a break into the high life thanks to protections from a union. Yet we hear not a peep from them in support of unions.

These same actors reach their high life thanks to consumer/viewer dollars, which is almost entirely made up of working class people. Major actors travel and are plugged into the international scene, so they know how Europeans gets 30 days annual paid time off, maternity/paternity paid time off, nationalized healthcare, and the like. But they do not support these things. Even worse, they do not even attempt to popularize these things, which is the very power their fame gives them. 

What result? The moneyed interests – the folks all leftists agree are the bad guys and rightfully so – swoop in and easily own the political market for an enormous bonanza. It’s almost as if old oil wealth and newer tech wealth are so embarrassed by how easily the public simply lets them strangle the rest of us, they see the wisdom of either (1) strangling further until their control is complete and unchangeable, or (2) slowly returning us to the more democratic and mutual-supporting country and globe really for fear that a sudden change would reveal how rotten they have been to the rest of us.

The Tesla CEO, who in recent years has paid little or no income tax and whose now-trillion-dollar car company was partly built on government aid, has been especially vocal in opposing a tax on the uber-wealthy to fund a more robust social safety net in America.

Since the pandemic began, America's billionaires have seen their collective fortunes soar more than 70% to more than $5 trillion, according to a report by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies Program on Inequality, which analyzed Forbes data.

Democrats argue that billionaires' windfall alone over the past two years would be enough to pay for President Joe Biden's social infrastructure plan. But the billionaire tax legislation was dead on arrival this fall when Senator Joe Manchin voiced concerns about penalizing ""people in the stratosphere.""


Since the start of the pandemic, America’s wealthiest have seen their collective fortunes soar more than 70% to more than $5 trillion. If the government taxed just the gains accrued in the last two years — which, again, were made possible by the Fed — the rich would remain thoroughly rich and the country could fund a more robust social safety net.
 
That was the Democrats’ plan this fall. But, rather unsurprisingly, the so-called billionaire tax faced resistance from – wait for it – billionaires.

Find the flaw in this plan,Conservative,0,sx0xcx,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sx0xcx/find_the_flaw_in_this_plan/,9,"Idea for a game. Thinking in terms of realism, is there any flaw in this plan?

1) Someone creates a set of laws for a hypothetical minarchist state – zero taxes, complete freedom, extremely harsh sentences for criminals, etc

2) They create a company which people can buy stocks in

3) The goal of the company is to buy an island and create a LARP'ing environment where libertarians can pretend to have their own state

4) They scout out fitting islands that are privately owned, and buys one of them

5) With the funds from the stocks, they build a couple of underground silos on the island – one for housing, with many ""apartments"", and one which houses LARP'ing courts, prison cells, a hypothetical but non-producing gold currency factory, etc. They also buy a lot of long-storage food.

6) Many people ""go on vacation"" to this island, to LARP

7) The remaining funds are used to buy gold

8) Through underground channels, they are able to quickly buy and transfer a nice arsenal of weapons to this island, and declare it to be a new nation, which would never attack anyone, but only defend itself against any hypothetical invasion (this would ensure that there's not much of a pretext for invading the island. Governments will of course want to do it, but how do they convince the man in the street and the average soldier that this is justified?)

9) Later, the gold-rich inhabitants and investors can come together and build a large gravity-based structure next to the island (like those supporting oil platforms), strong enough to withstand waves and attacks, and high enough to withstand tsunamis. On the top of this, one would built a flat platform, and divide it into private properties according to who put in the most money. And the places on top of pillars might be more expensive, since they can support skyscrapers, etc.

How would you fix this issue? Now imagine 400 years ago a race began towards an American Dream. Whites ran theirs , Blacks ran theirs. However those presiding over the race were partial, locking the legs of the Blacks together. Giving them no chance to run a fair race. Hundreds of years past; I will propose to you a question later on. For now let us continue. So hundreds of years pass the batons have been handed forward each generation. Only 2 generations ago, a few decades at most;  the rules changed and Blacks could run with their legs unburdened. 

&#x200B;

But how will they ever catch up? Thought things seem equal on a surface level do they not, but how many hundreds, thousands of miles have been lapped by the White racers of the past? But who will propose a solution and what can that solution be? Do we hobble the white racer running now to allow the current Black racer to catch up? That would seem extremely unfair to a White racer who was handed the baton recently without much knowledge of the past. He would say “we both run with our legs free everything is equal we have the same opportunity to win”. But..but do they really? No they do not. So do you give the current Black relay racer performance enhancing drugs to force a catch up to counteract the forced disadvantage created so long ago on his ancestors part of the race ? Maybe that would make the most sense, but..but for the White racer running currently he would think it is vastly unfair and unnatural. 

&#x200B;

So what do we do? It is neither fair to hobble a relay race team for extremely long while the other is unburdened then once the lead is unchallengeable to then free the burdened team and call that true equality. However is it fair to now give the previously burdened team an unfair advantage to catch-up to reverse the bias ness of the past?

With that being said I do think he set some good precedents in regards to the presidency such as the two-term limit and the cabinet system and I think we would arguably be worse off if those precedents were not set.

Beijing Biden’s DOJ Is Ending Trump National Security Initiative Protecting the US from China – Will Adjust Its Focus,Conservative,5,t0c4va,conservatives,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/t0c4va/beijing_bidens_doj_is_ending_trump_national/,1,"By Joe Hoft

Published February 24, 2022 at 7:00am

&#x200B;

The Biden team is hell-bent on destroying the USA. Not one thing that Biden has done since stealing the 2020 Election has been for America’s benefit, but all have helped China. Now Biden is being open about it.

President Trump initiated a program that would focus on and protect the US from China.  Now Biden is ending that program.  FOX News reports:

&#x200B;

The Department of Justice announced Wednesday that it is ending its “China Initiative” program that was aimed at preventing spying by the Chinese Communist Party, and launching a new, “broader approach.”

&#x200B;

The China Initiative was started in 2018 under the Trump administration to protect U.S. national security against Chinese spying on U.S. intellectual property and in academia. The DOJ website said it was aimed at “identifying and prosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage,” as well as “protecting our critical infrastructure against external threats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises.”

&#x200B;

That program is coming to an end. In its place, the DOJ is instituting a new “Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats.”

&#x200B;

“Our goal with this strategy is to take a comprehensive approach that draws on the full extent of our tools and authorities to address the alarming rise in illegal activity from hostile nations,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the DOJ’s National Security Division said. “This includes growing threats within the United States and to Americans and U.S. businesses abroad.”

&#x200B;

Olsen said “the current threat landscape demands a broader approach,” and cited not just China, but Iran, Russia, and North Korea.

&#x200B;

According to the article:

&#x200B;

A former Justice Department official lamented that the U.S. “stopped fighting for the China initiative on Jan 20, 2021,” the day President Biden took office.

&#x200B;

The former official told Fox News China was successful in framing the issue as one of racial bias, and that the U.S. stopped trying to counter this.

&#x200B;

“We gave up. You know the champagne corks will be popping at CCP offices. They won the disinformation campaign,” the former official said.

&#x200B;

This appears to be the truth.  Lawrence Sellin in exclusive reports at TGP has shared how China infiltrated US universities and biomedical research centers and through grants, training and education used the US to build its bioweapons military initiative that was likely behind the release of COVID in the country in 2019.  The US could have prevented this through actions to identify and then address Chinese infiltration in US universities and research centers.

&#x200B;

We also see this week that a company in Alabama has to shut down due to Biden’s actions in lifting the Trump tariffs with China.

&#x200B;

A Huntsville, Alabama, solar panel factory will close after President Joe Biden exempted foreign-made bifacial solar panels from United States tariffs earlier this month.

&#x200B;

LG Electronics, a South Korea-based company, announced that it will be closing its Huntsville solar panel manufacturing operation, resulting in the layoffs of about 160 American employees and another 60 Americans who are employed as contract workers.

Neyerere was born into the family of a cheif of the Zanaki People on the 13th April 1922, during his childhood he stayed with his mother (one of his father's many wives) and assited her with farming and other domestic tasks. the communal living style of the Zanaki people would later have an infuence on the Political beliefs of Nyrere. During the 1930s, due to beings a cheif's son Nyerere was allowed a western style education, during his education he was noted as an exellent student, it was here that he was first exposed to Christianity, becoming a Catholic in 1942 following the death of his father. He adopted the ''Christian name'' of Julius following his conversion, although was said to have remaked that the custom of taking a Christian name following a batism was ''silly''. Between 1943-47 Nyerere was in higher education at the Makerere collage in Kampala. During the late 1940s Nyerere worked as a teacher, and briefly as a price inspector for the local government. during this time he met, fell in love with and subsequently became informally engaged to Maria Gabriel (despite being in an arranged marrage to a young girl back in his father's village) at the same time he also began to become involved in politics joining the Tanganyika African Association (which wanted decolonisation and liberation from Imperialism for Tanganyika) between 1949-52 He wet abroad to study at Edinburgh Univercity. Following his return to Tanganyika in 1953, Nyerere Became an active decolonisation activist, he urged fellow anti-Imperialist to be as non-Violent as possible and is alleged to have been an an adirer of Mahatma Gandhi's non-Violent campaigns in India.

Following growing Pressure form the Tanganyika African Union (of which Nyerere was a prominent member) the British eventually Left Tanganyika in 1961. In 1962 Nyerere, who by this point was already a well know political and anti-colonial figure, was elected president. He would rule the country from between 1962-1985, during this time he pursued agricultural collecitvisation, education and literacy campaigns, and forged close links with other Socialist Nations - Notably Mao's China. Despite his close links with Marxist states, Nyerere was not a Marxist-Leninist and while he was in Office Nyerere delevloped his own unique form of African Socialism called [*Ujamaa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujamaa)*.* In 1964 Zanzibar unified with Tanganyika to form the nation today known as Tanzania. In 1967 Nyerere issued the Arusha declation that afffermed his and his party's commitment to building a democratic, and Socialist Sociaty in Tanzania. Another notable achievement of Nyerere's was the 1978 invasion of Uganda, which ended the Tyranical reign of Idi Amin. In 1985 he steped down as leader of the CCM and advocated for a multy party system to be developed in the country, he did however continue to avocated for the CCM an Ujamaa in the late 80s- early 1990s.

Nyerere Died of complications from Leukemia in a London Hospital 1999, he was 77. His body was flown back to Tanzania and given a state funeral. Today he is greatly respected in the country and seen as the father of the nation.

Written & Proposed By [Me]
All vocabulary can be located at the bottom of this bill.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that Pharmaceutical Drug Manufacturers and Health Insurance Commissioners should be regulated and restricted to a profit margin of no more than 30%.



Section 1:  This bill intends to enforce a regulated cap on the profit margin of prescription drug manufacturers and health insurance commissioners in order to limit price gouging. The profit margins of insurance premiums will be reduced to 30% (as opposed to 97%). The cost/retail profit margin of pharmaceutical drug manufacturers will be limited to 30% (as opposed to the median 75% ).

Section 2:  The regulation of drug prices will be limited to 30% of the wholesale cost in profit as enforced by the FDA. The regulation of health insurance premiums will be monitored by the NAIC (National Association of Insurance Commissioners), and will be regulated by a new federal organization. This new agency will be named Health Insurance for All Americans (HIFAA) and will be responsible for enforcing and regulating the price margin cap on health insurance premiums.

Section 3: Health Insurance For All Americans will be funded and managed by their parent agency The Department of Health and Human Services and work alongside the FDA. For every insurance commissioner that does not comply a $1,500 dollar fine will be issued for every overpriced premium sold.

Section 4: This bill will be enacted January 1st, 2022.

Section 1a: Key vocabulary for this bill:
Profit Margin: the amount by which revenue from sales exceeds costs in a business.
Price Gouging: Price gouging occurs when a seller increases the prices of goods, services or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair.
Health Insurance Premium: A health insurance premium is an upfront payment made on behalf of an individual or family in order to keep their health insurance policy active.",1637157088.0

His voice rose: ""Oh God, who is--"" and broke off.

""-- John Galt?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" he said, and shook his head as if to dispel some vision, ""only I don't like to say that.""

""I don't, either. I wish I knew why people are saying it and who started it.""

""That's it, ma'am. That's what I'm afraid of. It might have been me who started it.""

""What?""

""Me or about six thousand others. We might have. I think we did. I hope we're wrong.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well, there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for twenty years. It was when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody -- almost everybody -- voted for it. We didn't know. We thought it was good. No, that's not true, either. We thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid according to his need. We -- what's the matter, ma'am? Why do you look like that?""

""What was the name of the factory?"" she asked, her voice barely audible.

""The Twentieth Century Motor Company, ma'am, of Starnesville, Wisconsin.""

""Go on.""

""We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wasn't too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had any doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut -- because they made it sound like anyone who'd oppose the plan was a child-killer at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise? Hadn't we heard it all our lives -- from our parents and our school-teachers and our ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech? Hadn't we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there's some excuse for what we did at that meeting. Still, we voted for the plan -- and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma'am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil -- plain, naked, smirking evil, isn't it? Well, that's what we saw and helped to make -- and I think we're damned, every one of us, and maybe we'll never be forgiven...

""Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try pouring water into a tank where there's a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it, and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider, and the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand slinging buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six for your neighbor's supper -- for his wife's operation -- for his child's measles -- for his mother's wheel chair -- for his uncle's shirt -- for his nephew's schooling -- for the baby next door -- for the baby to be born -- for anyone anywhere around you -- it's theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures -- and yours to work, from sunup to sundown, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of your life, without rest, without hope, without end... From each according to his ability, to each according to his need...

""We're all one big family, they told us, we're all in this together. But you don't all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a day -- together, and you don't all get a bellyache -- together. What's whose ability and which of whose needs comes first? When it's all one pot, you can't let any man decide what his own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht -- and if his feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it's not right for me to own a car until I've worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage on earth -- why can't he demand a yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed? No? He can't? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he's replastered his living room? ... Oh well... Well, anyway, it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma'am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just one meeting to discover that we had become beggars -- rotten, whining, sniveling beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work didn't belong to him, it belonged to 'the family' -- and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them was his 'need' -- so he had to beg in public for his relief from his needs, like any lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife's head colds, hoping that 'the family' would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, because it's miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm -- so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each claiming that his need was worse than his brother's. How else could it be done? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort got away with the jackpot?

""But that wasn't all. There was something else that we discovered at the same meeting. The factory's production had fallen by forty percent, in that first half-year, so it was decided that somebody hadn't delivered 'according to his ability.' Who? How could you tell it? 'The family' voted on that, too. They voted which men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay -- because you weren't paid by time and you weren't paid by work, only by need.

""Do I have to tell you what happened after that -- and into what sort of creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when we knew that if we did our best for 'the family,' it's not thanks or rewards that we'd get, but punishment? We knew that for every stinker who'd ruin a batch of motors and cost the company money -- either through his sloppiness, because he didn't care, or through plain incompetence -- it's we who'd have to pay with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good.

""There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to 'the family,' didn't ask anything for it, either, couldn't ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn't gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn't come up with any ideas, the second year.

""What was it they'd always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compete for who'd do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn't it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who'd do the worst job possible. There's no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not -- your 'housing and feeding allowance,' it was called -- and above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You couldn't count on buying a new suit of clothes next year -- they might give you a 'clothing allowance' or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn't enough money for new suits for everybody, then you couldn't get yours, either.

""There was one man who'd worked hard all his life, because he'd always wanted to send his son through college. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan -- but 'the family' wouldn't give the father any 'allowance' for the college. They said his son couldn't go to college, until we had enough to send everybody's sons to college -- and that we first had to send everybody's children through high school, and we didn't even have enough for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fight over nothing in particular -- such fights were beginning to happen among us all the time.

""Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records. I guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days, he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music. Well, they didn't give him any 'allowance' for records -- 'personal luxury' they called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody's daughter, a mean, ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth -- this was 'medical need,' because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority complex if her teeth weren't straightened out. The old guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he couldn't forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them.

""Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don't ask how we got the money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there's always ways to get the rotten ones. You don't break into grocery stores after dark and you don't pick your fellow's pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle, but if it's to get stinking drunk and forget -- you do. Fishing tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn't any 'amusement allowance' for anybody. 'Amusement' was the first thing they dropped. Aren't you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it's something that gave you pleasure? Even our 'tobacco allowance' was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month -- and this, they told us, was because the money had to go into the babies' milk fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn't fall, but rose and kept on rising -- because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they didn't have to care, the baby wasn't their burden, it was 'the family's'. In fact, the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a 'baby allowance'. Either that, or a major disease.

""It didn't take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nicke's worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn't marry, he wouldn't help his folks back home, he wouldn't put an extra burden on 'the family'. Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility, he couldn't marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it. They bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all over the country, every unmarried pregnant sister, for an extra 'disability allowance,' they got more sicknesses than any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes -- what the hell, 'the family' was paying for it! They found more ways of getting in 'need' than the rest of us could ever imagine -- they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed.

""God help us, ma'am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we'd been given a law to live by, a moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed it -- for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next man's dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the dishonest collected. The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort of a law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren't many chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country's labor. Within one year under the new plan, there wasn't an honest man left among us. That was the evil. the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else that it could do -- and it was called a moral ideal!

""What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were cheating or plain incompetent, whether they were unwilling or unable -- what difference did that make to us? If we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs -- all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half-stockyards -- a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease -- beasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever's need.

""Love of our brothers? That's when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one man's new shirt, for another's wife's hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house -- it was taken from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to spy on one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as to cut their 'allowance' at the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday -- which he'd paid for by gambling, most likely. We began to meddle into one another's lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get somebody's relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn't want anyone to marry, we didn't want any more dependents to feed.

""In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn't speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now -- well, I'll tell you about just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names and we all liked her -- we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she'd have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for town. They never established the cause of death. No, I don't know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I -- and that's what I can't forget! -- I, too, had caught myself wishing that she would die. This -- may God forgive us! -- was the brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us!

""Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you're not goting to remind me that they'd sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one, too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma'am, depends on what it is you're after. And what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that.

""Eric Starnes, the youngest -- he was a jellyfish that didn't have the guts to be after anything in particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public Relations Department, which didn't do anything, except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn't have to bother sticking around the office. The pay he got -- well, I shouldn't call it 'pay,' none of us was 'paid' -- the alms voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn't riches. Eric didn't care for money -- he wouldn't have known what to do with it. He spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn't stand him.

""Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what the size of his take of -- his alms -- had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out, and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for him -- it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack -- a hundred pounds, we weighed them -- of magazines in Gerald's office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap show-off who's got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough -- except that he makes no bones about the cash being his, and you're free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don't. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesn't care for material wealth, that he's only serving 'the family,' that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it's necessary to keep up the presige of the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public -- then that's when you learn to hate the creature as you've never hated anything human.

""But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists -- just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting -- by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, trying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rules to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody's life except his own -- then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the 'family meetings' -- in the name of 'production efficiency and time economy,' one meeting used to take ten days -- and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Starnes' office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then she made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a ten-minute period on the agenda for discussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a factory's income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people's value. Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father's time, all of his money wouldn't have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you sould have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who'd talked back to her once and who'd just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who's ever preached the slogan: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.'

""This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination -- when five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn't do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choice -- it's because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren't so innocent either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn't do it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we'd be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn't a man voting for it who didn't think that under a setup of this kind he'd muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There wasn't a man rich and smart enough but that he didn't think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better's wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he'd get unearned benefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who'd get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all his inferiors who'd rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss's, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. That was our real motive when we voted -- that was the truth of it -- but we didn't like to think it, so the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good.

""Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we'd asked for, it was too late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in the first week of the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest-skilled workers. A man of self-respect doesn't turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but they couldn't take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a pesthole -- till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability.

""And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century -- and, somehow, we couldn't make ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we couldn't quit, because no other employer would have us -- for which I can't blame him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesville fast -- till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory's needy kept stretching, but the list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don't know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor that didn't have something wrong with it -- the magic stamp began to work the other way around: people wouldn't take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century. And it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but because we needed the orders so badly.

""By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out? What good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane?

""Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to work, when you're tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To work -- and whenever any men failed anywhere, it's you who would have to make up for it. To work -- with no chance to rise, with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle, any famine, any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work -- with no chance for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through college. To work -- on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you'll never see, whose needs you'll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question -- just to work and work and work -- and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This -- a moral ideal?

""Well, we tried it -- and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world -- and that the plan was a noble ideal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy -- the one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year -- got up, as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.""

...

""But what about John Galt?"" she asked. ... ""You were going to tell me who was the John Galt they mean -- if there ever was such a person.""

""I hope there wasn't, ma'am. I mean, I hope that it's just a coincidence, just a sentence that hasn't any meaning.""

""You had something in mind. What?""

""It was...it was something that happened at that first meeting at the Twentieth Century factory. Maybe that was the start of it, maybe not. I don't know... [needs completing]<",1645647890.0
Demolishing The communist spending(keynesian) blunder,Conservative,7,sws6uy,Capitalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/sws6uy/demolishing_the_communist_spendingkeynesian/,1,"Saving is not Hoarding, there's major difference.

Hoarding is keeping a stockpile of money in a vault or under your bed. Saving on the otherhand is loaning it to banks which later circulate the financial market to fund other capital. Saving is the only force behind wealth as opposed to keynesian spending that kills of value by debasing a currency through indiscriminate printing. i called it keynesian because keynesianism is socialism. it goes along with Marx's Socialist policies In Communist manifesto where marx pointed out specific means to transfer wealth from the wealthy to the poor through progressive taxes,higher interest rates,inheritance taxes,wealth taxes,welfare states. This socialist phase is a precursor to the ""soymunist utopia"" marx longed for so its imperative to demolish this preposterous idea that discourages saving.


John Gaynard Keynes utilises income in order to derive his consumption function and spending multiplier. he also  require interest rate to bolster a positive consumption line. but,when the majority of households are included, such positive possibility is disproved


He postulates a different consumption function, which forms the basis of his fiscal theory. The image i provided illustrates the function, where the x-axis measures income, and y-axis spending. This function has a + intercept and a + slope. The + consumption line derives Keynesian multiplier. I will prove that the same Keynesian drivel to prove that such consumption line cannot be positive, to demolish the multiplier delusion.


John gaynard keynes dedicates couple of chapters to rescue his marginal inclination to consume, or the positive slope of the consumption line. His justification include: (1) A change in wage-unit; (2) A change in the discrepancy between income and net income; (3) sudden changes in capital-values not allowed for in calculating net income; (4) Changes in the rate of time-discounting, for example in the ratio of exchange between present goods & future commodity; (5) Changes in fiscal policy; (6) Changes in expectations of the relation between the present and the future level of income; (7) Any other subjective factors.
These are the factors that may influence the shape of the consumption line or may shift it, to be precise,Keynes considered income as more valuable than interest rate.and we will prove the opposite

 The Combination of Interest Rate & income
If someone works for a single period, but lives for 2 periods, he will budget his income between  2 periods in order to maximise his total utility, which is supposed to be:
(A)U =logC1 +logC2.
considering that person has only the first period income, Y, his budget constraint is:
(B)C1 + 1 C2 =Y, 1+i
where 2nd period consumption should be discounted by interest rate, i. 
Maximise (A)subject to (B)to achieve the following solutions:
C1 = 0.5Y , and C2 = 0.5(1 + i)Y .

Alternatively, if that individual has income from the 2nd period, his budget constraint becomes:
(B') C1(1+i)+C2 =Y , and the utility maximizing solutions are:
C1 = 0.5Y , and C2 = 0.5Y . 1+i



We may plot the corelation between consumption & income graphically. Since Y may be income from Period 1 or 2, there are 2 different graphs. consider for the moment that Y happens to be from Period 2. Given positive interest rate, the higher Period 2 consumption associated with the income may deliver the Keynesian positive consumption line, as illustrated in (B) If interest rate is zero, the consumption line will be a horizontal line. In this regard, Keynes requires interest rate to support his theory. though, there is another graph.
suppose next that income is from Period 1. Since the second period has no income, C2 is the intercept. If the interest rate is zero, both consumptions are identical, and the consumption line is horizontal. If interest rate is positive, C2 is the larger than C1, the slope of the consumption line is negative, as depicted in (C) If employment or lifespan is not certain, or if future income is expected to decline, people will save a bigfer proportion of their income, and the slope will be further diminished.

Now Keynes consumption line can be positive or negative, but provided that more people work in Period 1, the consolidated or averaged line could not be positive.
A higher income, i:e because of government’s consumption cash voucher, just shifts the consumption line upward, but does not change its slope. This shifting has been misunderstood by Keynesian economists as a positive relation between income and consumption.
Milton Friedman’s  45 degree permanent consumption line could also be explained by this model. If this country has only two people,one is working and the other is not, the total income must be Y, and C1+ C2=Y, whatever amount Y may be. The empirical result may deviate from 45 degrees  because of the existence of interest rate.

 John Gaynard Keynes' consumption line couldnt be positive. Without a positive consumption line, any addition of government spending do not increase income more than proportionately. There's no multiplier any more, and Keynes' fiscal policy becomes unsubstantiated.

Keynesianism is the communist's sneaky way to destroy capitalism. let's not allow that to happen

The welfare state and democratic elements of Australia,Liberal,48,swql6m,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/swql6m/the_welfare_state_and_democratic_elements_of/,32,"I decided to do a write up going into some aspects of Australia's welfare state and democratic form of government, this won't cover every aspect of every specific thing but I tried to get most of the important stuff, hopefully you find this interesting.

\- Australia has a universal health insurance system called Medicare, this insurance covers 100% of the costs for many services and care at public hospitals and a portion of the cost at private hospitals and is funded by a 2% levy on taxable income. Services which are covered under Medicare are also listed under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, depending on the situation medicare reimburses anywhere between 75 and 100 percent of the schedule fees, depending on what the service is and whether it was conducted at a private or public hospital. One of the main things missing from Medicare currently is dental, however there is dental coverage for children and and emergency services for adults with a pensioner concession card. There is also the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is a list of medicines that the federal government buys in order to lower the price, however drugs not within this scheme can be quite expensive, but most needed pharmaceutical medications are covered. Many General Practitioners do bulk billing which means consultations are of no cost under medicare, however those who do not do bulk billing can still have a portion of the costs subsidized under medicare. There are also caps on the gap costs for Medicare as it relates to out of hospital services which is currently $495.60 AUD this value gets indexed to the Consumer Price Index every year. Other things like the emergency room are free, while ambulances are only free and covered in Queensland and Tasmania, in every other state if you want ambulances to be covered you need to buy ambulance insurance. Along with medicare there is also the National Disability Insurance scheme which covers all the costs related to dealing with disabilities for those with permanent disabilities.

\- Every Australian worker is entitled to a minimum of 4 weeks (20 days) of paid vacation days, this is in addition to public holidays which varies by state from anywhere between 10 days in Western Australia to 13 days in Victoria.

\- While Australia used to have tuition free University thanks to Gough Whitlam's Labor government in the 70s, they later changed to college being paid through tuition fees under Bob Hawke's labor government. However the system put in place to get loans for education wasn't the worst thing, under the HECS loan system the debt you take is interest free and only requires repayment once you make over $47,014 AUD starting from 1% of income and it has a progressive tax income bracket which ramps up to 10% of income once you make over $137,898 AUD a year. The only adjustment made yearly to the loan is an indexation to the consumer price index (CPI) in order to keep the loans real value throughout time as it relate to cost of living, however the loans are all interest free so that is the only adjustment done. These loans also get written off in the event of death. It's not free education but as a loan repayment system, it's definitely one of the much more sensible models.

\- PHDs are free of charge to Australian citizens under the Research Training Program, so there's no tuition for PHD programs in Australia.

\- Every Australian is entitled to 10 days of paid sick leave, it all can add up through years so it doesn't go away if not used.

\- Australia has paid maternity leave which lasts for 18 weeks long along with 2 weeks of paid paternity leave for fathers, all of which is paid out at the national minimum wage in Australia.

\- Childcare in Australia is subsidized on a federal level, 85% of the cost is subsidized for families with incomes below $70,015 AUD, over $170,015 AUD the subsidy is 50%, over $344,305 AUD the subsidy is 20% and beyond $353,680 AUD the subsidies cut off.

\- Australia's minimum wage is currently $20.33 AUD an hour and is reviewed every year by the fair work commission who both review and adjust the minimum wage on a yearly basis.

\- Australia requires employees get paid a higher rate when given overtime as well as given advance notice of any overtime and bars employers from having overtime risk the employees health or personal responsibilities, employees are also given the right to refuse unreasonable overtime if they don't meet the many factors laid out in the law, all these factors are laid out in Australia's [fair work](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employment-conditions/hours-of-work-breaks-and-rosters/hours-of-work/when-overtime-applies) legislation

\- Australia has a child benefit system known as the Family Tax Benefit, which can be divided into Family Tax Benefit Part A and Part B. Under Part A of this benefit scheme parents can get up to \~$191 AUD for children up to 12 and \~ $248 for children up to 19 every two weeks, however this can vary depending on both circumstances as well as yearly income. Family Tax Benefit Part B is an additional benefit on top of Part A for people such as single parents, families with only one source of income, and this benefit can pay up to $162.54 AUD for children under 5, $113.54 AUD for children between 5 and 18, usually payed out every two weeks, however it can also be paid as a lump sum at the end of the financial year. Tax Benefit Part B also pays out an extra \~383$ AUD payment at the end of the financial year. All of these benefits are not taxable, making them even more beneficial for the recipient.

\- On top of all of those child benefits Australia also pays you $575 AUD when you have a newborn child as an upfront lump sum payment along with a newborn supplement of up to $1725.36 AUD over 13 weeks for your first child and $576.03 AUD over 13 weeks for each additional child. All of these payments are also not taxable.

\- Australia's retirement system comes in multiple parts. The first part is known as superannuation which was introduced in the 1990s under Paul Keating's Labor government. The way it works is your employer is required to put in a specific percentage of your wage into a superannuation savings account (the current rate is 10.5% of ordinary time earnings, however this rate will increase every year). Once this money is in a super account of your choosing, it is then invested by the account in a diverse array of sectors so that it can grow through many years. For Americans this is similar to a mandatory 401k investment system, except the entire working population has it. On top of superannuation Australia also has an pension system which is paid for through general income taxation and is paid out after you reach retirement age, the maximum payout can vary depending on your assets and net worth however the pension can pay up to $967.50 AUD for those who are single and $1,458 AUD for couples every two weeks. The other aspect of Australias retirement system is additional superannuation savings (which are encourage through tax benefits) along with voluntary private sector retirement savings.

\- Australia also has an unemployment benefit system which pays anywhere between $573.30 AUD to $862.10 AUD every two weeks depending on your situation. On top of this when you're on unemployment benefits you are also eligible for rental assistance which can rage from $95.02 every two weeks to $189.70 every two weeks depending on your situation. These are also funded through general taxation on a federal level so unlike the US, things don't vary as much state by state.

\- Australia also has a Youth Allowance system, which pays those who are in education/job training. For those in education and under 24 years old, payments can range from $313.80 AU to $577.40 AUD paid out every two weeks depending on your age and living situation.

\- For those 25 and older attending school/apprenticeship you can get Austudy which can pay up to $679.00 every two weeks, depending on your situation.

\- Australia has an interesting voting system, with mandatory voting enforced by fining those who don't turn in a ballot on election day. The way elections work within Australia's parliament are through voting for two bodies, the house of representatives, and the senate. The house of representatives are voted for through ranked choice ballots in single member districts, meaning that you can vote for whoever you like without fearing your vote being wasted, the terms for the house are a maximum of 3 years. The districts for the house of representatives are done by the Australian Electoral Commission which is a non partisan body, so gerrymandering isn't as much of a thing in the Australian house of representatives. The australian senate works in a very different manner using a proportional representation system, which means seats are divided up by political parties in respect to the percentage of the popular vote they get in a state. When you vote for senate you can also vote for either a party or for specific senate candidate within a party. Each state has twelve senators and each territory (which includes the northern territory and the Australian capital territory) gets two senators, the terms for the senators last for 6 years. Usually during each federal election 40 senate seats are up for grabs with the exception of double dissolution which occurs when the senate and house are in a legislative deadlock and the prime minister requests a double dissolution, as a result when double dissolution occurs every senate seat is up for grabs during the election.

\- Australia, like the US and Germany also has a federal government system. So states/territories have some control over how things go in specific states/territories. For example in the Australian Capital territory, it is legal to grow your own marijuana plants, something that is illegal in every other Australian State.

Post-war propaganda was explicit about the need for women to relinquish their wartime factory jobs to returning men and the suburban home was the perfect fix for re-establishing normative gender roles,Liberal,10,rsnuvv,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rsnuvv/postwar_propaganda_was_explicit_about_the_need/,2,"I was recently reading Leslie Kern's new book. She was writing, in part, about the growth of the suburbs after World War II. This is from the book: 

If the racial effects of suburban development linger today, so too do the gendered effects. Hayden puts it succinctly: “Developers argued that a particular kind of house would help the veteran change from an aggressive air ace to a commuting salesman who mowed the lawn. That house would also help a woman change from Rosie the Riveter to a stay-at-home mom.” Post-war propaganda was explicit about the need for women to relinquish their wartime factory jobs to returning men and the suburban home was the perfect “fix” for re-establishing normative gender roles. By providing a spatial solution to the temporary widening of women’s horizons, the public-private, paid-unpaid work divide could be “naturally” re-established between the sexes.

The suburban lifestyle both assumed and required, in order to function properly, a heterosexual nuclear family with one adult working outside the home and one inside. Large houses, isolated from transit and other services, meant the stay-at-home wife and mother was required to perform a full-time domestic caretaker role, overseeing the home and managing the needs of the breadwinner and children. As feminst planner Sherilyn MacGregor states, this built form has “created a lasting infrastructure for the \[gendered\] division of labour,” one that pre-supposes the traditional heterosexual nuclear family.

**PREAMBLE**

Considering that it is a multipolar world, not a unipolar world of geopolitical hegemony, that has historically given class movements in multiple countries political momentum in terms of regular class struggle,

Considering that developing countries can play off competing imperialist powers against each other, especially on trade,

Considering that, even if a multipolar world may make the great leveller of inter-imperialist war more likely, it also makes the great leveller of revolution more likely by utterly discrediting at least one imperialist power,

The following ought to be obligated upon immediately, outside a revolutionary period for the working class, including the absence of mass party-movements.

The following ought to be obligated upon all relevant parties immediately, including ""lesser evil"" imperialist powers.

**UKRAINE AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION**

- Immediate, comprehensive demobilization of the entire Armed Forces of Ukraine, including but not limited to heavy weapons and other military equipment

- Immediate, comprehensive ceasefire on the part of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation

- Withdrawal by the Russian Federation of heavy weapons

- OSCE monitoring

- Immediate constitutional reform in Ukraine including decentralization, taking into account the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic

- Withdrawal by the Russian Federation of remaining military equipment, foreign armed formations, and mercenaries - subject to the aforementioned constitutional reform

- All other provisions of Minsk II

- Immediate diplomacy for other relevant peace conditions

- Immediate end to all crackdowns on anti-war protesters

**US and EUROPE**

- No direct NATO member involvement whatsoever, including no-fly zones

- No support for individuals choosing to fight for the Ukrainian government

- No weapons deliveries to the Ukrainian government

- Abolition of all sanctions against the Russian people, including vital sectors of the Russian economy

- Immediate denunciation of chauvinist practices engaged by, or tolerated by, Ukraine

- Immediate acceptance of war refugees

- Immediate satisfaction of all geography-based security interests of the Russian Federation, on the part of all Atlanticist powers (the US and Europe)

- Abolition of NATO, subsequent to the aforementioned security interests satisfaction

Workers are the masters of history and the driving force behind historical development. We metal workers have contributed to the development of the metal industry and social development as the main players in production, and have been fighting at the forefront of the Korean labor movement against capitalist exploitation, oppressive structures, and foreign forces.

Inheriting the spirit of unity and indomitable will to fight of our senior workers, we vigorously establish a metal union for a new leap forward in the democratic union movement.

We, metal workers, will fight in solidarity with workers around the world against the globalization of neoliberal capital that leads to the spread of subordination, discrimination and poverty in order to protect human dignity and equal life, and firmly work with the people and progressive forces of this land. In solidarity, we will take the lead in building a society in which the workers and the people are the masters, an equal society in which oppression and discrimination are abolished, and a unified motherland in which the two Koreas are united.

I'm a guy from Norway. Lately I've been reading - and watching some youtube videoes - about the corona pass situation and I've tried to take in all the different perspectives, from ""Goverment knows best"" to ""This is robbing my personal freedom"". What I've noticed in my online research (on forums, comments, videoes etc) is that SOME Americans have a really warped understanding of what a social democracy actually is. I've come across people that seriously believe we have to stand in bread lines to get breakfast every day in Scandinavia. And I've seen several people compare a social democracy to the society in George Orwell's 1984, which is very strange IMO cause George Orwell was himself a socialist and the book is not a warning about socialism, but about totalitarianism.   


Anyway, this has made me interested in hearing from American people that believes in Social Democracy. How do you feel that the general understanding of a social democracy is in the US?

Thoughts on labor market monopsony?,Liberal,19,rq9bso,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/rq9bso/thoughts_on_labor_market_monopsony/,5,"Introductory paragraph for those that aren't already aware, monopsony is the flipside of monopoly. A monopoly is a single seller while a monopsony is a single buyer. In the labor market, firms are the buyers of the labor that workers sell. Aside from restricted cases, there are no literal monopsonies. What we're really interested in is if there is concentrated power on one side in the form of some price setting power as opposed to price taking predicted by perfect competitive market conditions. We could call the ability to price set wages on the part of firms ""monopsony power.""

If you believe in monopsony power, you can justify a range of labor policies as being economically efficient, such that minimum wage laws and collective bargaining wouldn't lead to unemployment. So whether or not it exists feels very important to establish. Failing to establish labor market monopsony means conceding that strong labor policy sacrifices employment for some people (though it's a bullet you could perhaps make a case for biting.)

A counter I've heard is that low skilled laborers actually have a lot of firms available to them to work for. Going from a low skilled job to a completely different low skilled job, let's say from being a construction worker to being a retail worker, doesn't have high transition costs compared to say switching from being a chemical engineer to being a computer programer. Therefore low wage, low skilled workers ought to be experiencing less monopsony power than high skilled workers.

The good counter counter I've heard is job search frictions are what really causes monopsony power for most low skilled workers. Perfectly competitive labor economic theory predicts that any firm that attempts to set wages would lose all of its workers immediately. I'm sure there would be an increase in turnover, but a firm probably wouldn't lose literally all its potential workers. Partially because people don't perfectly monitor their other options, partially because of a prospect theory type thing where people are more likely to act to avoid loses than to gain, and partially because changing jobs is stressful, involves considerable cognitive effort and possibly even moving to really maximize income. That might give employers some leeway in being able to price set.

What are your thoughts though? Does it exist? Why does it exist? Can we point to good empirical evidence that it exists?",1640674088.0

I dedicate this text to my parents, thanking them for being my support system ever since I was born.

Have you ever heard or read somewhere a phrase like that: ""behind a great man is always a great woman""?

Because behind a great woman, usually, is also a great woman, perhaps her motherly figure, her girlfriend or wife, her daughter, her grandma, and or her maid.

First of all, just to make things clear, I was only able to write this text venting because of how lucky I am that I was able to dedicate the majority of my time to my education studying, because I can rely upon my mom to do domestic chores and upon my present dad as a ""breadwinner"", that's to say that I recognize how lucky and privileged I am of having a support system, what many feminine people lack, although they can find support with one another, and that is what usually happens, specially in the case of many feminine people who achieved success in life as ""breadwinners"".  

Approaching, through the lens of afro-feminisms, inside this rather minoritary group of feminine people who achieved success in life as ""breadwinners"", many of them are white women who have had the lucky and privilege to have in their lives another feminine person in a supporting role as their support system that they could count on, and usually, that's a domestic maid, specially an woman of color or foreign woman, that, usually, due to lack of higher degrees of education face less opportunities in life for them and end up having to take on those supporting roles.

This isn't anything new in history other than an inheritance from the times of slavery and colonization, ever since dating back to those times, women of color had to sacrifice investing focus and time into their domestic, personal and family lives to take care of the lives and children of white women for these women focus on achieving their own personal success, while the families and children of women of color, usually, were left deprived of attention and care out there in the world if not on their own and forced to mature faster than their whither and richer peers, specially when it comes to so called ""third world"" countries.

Curiously, since those maids spend more time with the kids of those, usually, whither women from higher classes than them, they know better about kids that are not theirs than of about their own kids, usually having to take on motherly roles to raise children that are not even theirs and that, usually, are known lesser by their own mothers, who have little time for them, because they are busy investing their time and energy working, because, paraphrasing the philosopher Karl Marx, ""we must work to live, and live to work"" in the capitalist patriarchal way of organizing and (re)producing human existence and living life model we currently live in as a society.

If you don't believe what I have said so far, I highly recommend watching this very short ""YouTube"" video entitled ""Who Knows Kids Better? Mums Vs Maids | Inspirational Video"" in the channel called ""Heart Touching Films"", which you can check out in the following link: https://youtu.be/8oME-ar9WpI

In a video in the ""YouTube"" channel of Kristen Leo entitled ""The Collapse Of Hetero Relationships"", which you can check out in the following link: https://youtu.be/ioRCGlQ30Ec, recommends that everybody is better off living with their parents if they have the appropriate environment or conditions to do so, that way, maids wouldn't be necessary to take care of the domestic lives of other feminine people, but ultimately that doesn't solve their issues, because the maids would still need other ways to work to produce their future existence and survive while also providing to who they care for, so they would end up just looking for other jobs if that were the case and still leaving their own families out of affection and proper care, that's to say that the maids have no other choices, they are not guilty for all of that, the condition of their families and lives is ultimately a product of the ways of (re)producing existence in the society they live in, on the contrary, those maids that hold together not only their lives but both the lives of their families and those of other families are very admirable women in their strengths.

Perhaps, the best way out for those maids come from recommendations proposed when taking the lens of afro-feminims into consideration, that's to say that, ultimately, if only the maids were paid by the governments, like housewives in countries like Argentina already are thanks to feminisms, for spending all their time and efforts taking care of their domestic lives and families while raising their children with a better education that could pay off improving the future of society, what could impact everyone positively, would definitely be the best way out, as far as I am aware.


But what happens when this figure of the subserviant woman in a supporting ""secondary character"" role in her own life is not present in the life of another woman?

Anyway, in the capitalist patriarchal sociocultural model of organizing and (re)producing human existence and dividing gender roles and expectations, somebody has to take care of the domestic chores, usually considered feminine, in order for another person achieve success while ""working to live, and living to work"", again paraphrasing Karl Marx when he criticized such models of organizing and producing existence, rather unsustainable models since they end depending upon a whole variety of kinds of exploitation of different kinds of femininities, and, ultimately, the exploitation not only of human resources but the resources from MOTHER nature in general, also known as the very first and most exploited lady of them all through history.


Off course none of those are not the only definite model for the way of organizing and living your life, besides those, out there is also the women who does both the sociocultural gender roles imposed, expected and forced upon women/mothers and men/fathers, she basically carries the whole responsibility of holding together the lives of those she cares about on her own back.


Although this alternate, rather androgynously genderqueer and anglospheric, ideal of femininity is as much of an empowered warrior as also are the lesbian eco-feminists, she usually ends up having to ""wear both the pants and aprons"" in her relationships with disproportionate heteronormative dynamics of gender role divisions and expectations, having to ""parent"" her kids and usually rather immature boyfriends or husbands that can exploit their empowered skills and strengths, that if they have a boyfriend or husband to begin with, otherwise they have to play both ""motherly"" and ""fatherly"" roles for their children, what scares men away, usually.

Perhaps, the character called ""Nicole"" in the cartoon called ""The Amazing World Of Gumball"", who is the mother of the titular character, ""Gumball"", is the best example of such alternative rather androgynous ideal of femininity, since the show usually pulls out of her jokes, that come across to me as more of social satire than mean-spirited, about her breaking down in anger due to her ""short fuse"" because the of all the pressure put upon her for having to carry by her own back all the responsibilities of keeping together the lives of those she cares about, while not having to only parent her children but also parent her immature lazy husband that she loves deeply regardless of all that anyway.

But what happens when a man is not present in the life of a woman?

Well, there is also the jealously that some hetero women have over lesbian and aromantic asexual women being able to picture and find their happiness without men in their lives, specially when talking, for example, about alternative ideals of (organizing and producing their) existence, specially lesbian eco-feminisms, which are about escaping the patriarchies and capitalisms towards living independent, as in sustainable and self-sufficient, minimalist lives in a rural commune, without men and money, living off subsistence vegan agriculture, sharing and trading while embracing all of nature, inclusive your queer feminine nature shamelessly, independently and sustainably, an ideal utopian romantic rural fantasy setting, to say the least.

I am sorry if I came across as ""harsh"" because of my rather ""acid"" sense of humor, when trying to break down what lesbian eco-feminisms are about into a nutshell, while comparing two different ideals of femininity inherent to two different ideals of organizing existence and living:

https://www.reddit.com/user/DoNotTouchMeImScared/comments/rbdgud/unsustainable_patriarchal_capitalisms_x/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Both of them are technically housewives, their differences revolve around them being very different ideals of femininity inherent to two different, rather white eurocentric, ideals of organizing and producing existence and living: the housewife in the left side of the image is an rather retrograde ideal of femininity attached to very conservative worldviews and values, while, on the other hand, the housewife on the right side of the image is a rather androgynously genderqueer ideal of femininity attached to very progressive worldviews and values.

I'm not gonna lie, but the ""cottagecore"" ideals and aesthethics may often come across as just an white eurocentric ideal of femininity rebranded towards sapphic and ambientalist women when linked to embracing a rather fantastical and romanticized version of nature, so to say, ""cottagecore witches"" are just housewives but gay and hippie.


In this another post about the same topics I made a few days ago, a lot of comments made by heteropesimist/heterofatalist feminist women, who in their hopelessness, were resentful and jealous of such alternative ideal socio-environmentalist feminist romantic rural fantasy setting of lesbian eco-feminisms which sapphics can dream of and aspire as a direction towards in their lives as an alternative possibility of existence, were deleted:

https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/ra6o9f/dont_we_all_dream_of_that_then_we_gotta_unite_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


Before this week, never would I have ever thought that someday I would have to deffend hetero marriage against heteropesimist/heterofatalist women, while also defending feminisms and (gender)queerness against environmentalists.

If you have no idea what heteropesimism or heterofatalism is about and want to understand better the feelings of hopelessness of hetero women who believe they are doomed to a fate of pain because they also believe that ultimately there is no way out nor hope in living (love) lives fred from exploitations, I highly recommend giving this other text i wrote another day about the topic a read: https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/r9zflf/heteronormative_and_homonormative_relationship/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I cannot entirely understand how painful that must be to face being forced so ""bitterly"" to ""wake up"" from the dreams of a fairytale romantic ""happily ever after"" fantasy with a charming prince you have grown up with, dreamed of and aspired towards for so long as a meaningful direction for your life.

I am not gonna lie, due to feeling like that, I often end up idealizing and daydreaming about and finding so appealing the lesbian eco-feminist model of existence as an alternative to the capitalist cis-heterero-normative patriarchal model of existence I live with that keeps bringing me more and more pain through the years.",1639016897.0

What is the libertarian position on the Ukraine conflict?,Conservative,0,t038ab,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/t038ab/what_is_the_libertarian_position_on_the_ukraine/,19,"Donetsk and Lugansk are the two separatist territories in Ukraine at play here(collectively known as the Donbas region), the leaders of these areas are backed by Russia. They had a vote on 2014( The 2014 Donbas referendum) to officially separate from Ukraine and become an independent republic which passed: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/11/eastern-ukraine-referendum-donetsk-luhansk](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/11/eastern-ukraine-referendum-donetsk-luhansk)

These people democratically voted to separate themselves from Ukraine but Ukraine and other countries internationally failed to recognize their democratic vote. Ukraine has been shelling these two cities ever since in order to beat them into submission and force them to stay part of the country.

Minks agreement was enacted in 2014 to calm down the carnage that was going on in the region as a temporary solution. Everything in the Donbas region was to be done ""On temporary Order of Local Self-Governance in Particular Districts of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts"",  so they got some self-governance but had to comply with most of Ukraine's rules and there was a ceasefire.

There were multiple violations to the ceasefire after the Minks protocol was enacted though and Ukraine kept bombing the Donbas region. Russia has now become the first country to recognize the 2014 Donbas referendum and assert these two cities are indeed two separate republics, it is now to responding to the shelling the separatist have been dealing with for years from the Ukranian side.

People see this as a random invasion into Ukraine but that seems to be far from the truth. These two regions were already largely separated from Ukraine and  even voted to separate themselves from the country. Their leadership is Russia backed and has been fighting Ukrainian aggression for years now. Looks to me like Putin is responding to the Ukrainian aggression on these two cities. Then again Russia could just want to annex them and is using that as a pretext.

The dirty truth about investing in stocks,Liberal,7,r12tjh,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/r12tjh/the_dirty_truth_about_investing_in_stocks/,13," 

Actually, most investors lose money in the stock market. Not triple their money. That’s a myth. For example all those stories about how if you bought the S&P 500 or DOW decades ago are lies. Why? **Because 80% of the original S&P 500 went bankrupt or collapsed in price significantly and then were REPLACED by other companies.** You’d be lucky to break even in the stock market. Only hedge funds who have the advantage of information that regular investors lack, tend to do well, like in the recent Robin Hood scandal. The moment retail traders get a bright idea, the whole system tries to shut them down. The system is not designed to allow average Joes to profit. The only way average people make money reliably is by buying up property/land and becoming a rent-seeker landlord (the bane of capitalism according to Adam Smith).

The entire press is in on the scheme of impoverishing retail stock traders. **They NEVER mention that much of the DOW Jones rise during the 2000’s was due to removing bad stocks and replacing them with rising ones. i.e. DOW could be 20,000, t**hen you take out Blockbuster and replace it with Apple and it goes to 21,000 instead of falling to 19,000 as it should. Again, the vast majority of the original S&P500 have all gone bankrupt or were removed from the index for “low performance” and replaced.

Did you know that most of the world’s economic news is part of a monopoly of information thanks to the Associated Press and they HOLD key economic information for several key minutes and sell that information to traders.

I kept noticing when I was doing a lot of day trading that I kept being a few minutes behind the curve and kept wondering what the heck was going on, only for the news to show up 2–3 minutes later. I did research and found out about the press’ secret financial info monopoly. The price to know things 5 minutes before everyone else? $10,000/month for a single license.

 

**Stocks are all a zero-sum game. 1 person wins, the other loses. You sell high (winning), means someone else is buying high (losing).**

In order to buy low and sell high, there has to be an believing-the-hype guy buying high and a panicked average Joe selling low. That person is usually the average guy who lacks the info the hedge funds have.

**THAT is why the media constantly promotes lies about buying stocks to the average Joe: so THEY can be the rubes who lose all their money in the stock market to the benefit of the hedge funds.**

Simply put, the common man is easy prey. The best stocks often are not available for the public to buy anyways.

And stocks constantly get diluted. They are essentially corporate currency which the company can inflate at any time. When they give CEOs $200 million in stock, you know what they are doing? They PRINT $200 million new shares of stock. They don’t buy it from investors. That’s right, you just got screwed and diluted shares.

Thoughts on Liberals and Rational Thinking?,Liberal,5,o6hfpi,Liberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/o6hfpi/thoughts_on_liberals_and_rational_thinking/,8,"A huge part of the reason I've identified as relatively liberal is because I have strong reasons to beleive that many policies and ideas that are labeled as liberal are in fact scientifically sound. Having worked in (natural science) academia for much of my life so far, I really came to appreciate the scientific method, high quality data, trustworthy sources and rigorous statistical analysis as key components to forming opinions on any topic. Equally important is critical review and ability to change and adjust opinions if new facts are identified. 

At an earlier age I self-righteously thought that conservatives were far less likely to think in these terms, and that liberlas, on the other hand, were driven by scientific rationalism rather than ideology. While I still beleive that this is still true to some extent, the amount of liberals I have encountered that beleive in things dogmatically, refuse to debate hypotheses (or even consider alternate hypotheses), or cite research results with very little understandng an nuance has been disheartening.

A few examples that have come to mind over the years include the gender wage gap - it's causes and nuances, how it is defined, what 70 cents on the dollar actually means. Statistics on race and crime, discussion of black on black crime or the relationship between black inner city culture and crime, in addition to all the systematic/socioeconomic/racism reasons that are discussed. Questions about trans athletes, bone structure, lung volume, etc. that presists even after hormonal treatment. There are other examples, but it seems like sometimes even raising or questioning these topics can get you accused of all sorts of terrible things. 

Another somewhat specific example, but one that is especially relevant to me, is Russia, since I am Russian-American. Putin is awful (and getting worse), and I actively participate in anti-Putin protests when I'm there. However, when I discuss him or Russian politics with US liberals, I notice that there are many blatant misconceptions. For example, people tend to think of Putin and Trump as having the same mindset - in some ways they do - but in others, they are absolutely different. For example, Putin is very much NOT an ethno-state nationalist, goes out of his way to cater to the conservative part of muslims in Russia, and has quite lenient immigration policies, mostly affecting people from Central Asia. The far right , at least the ethnic far right, in Russia hates Putin as much as the liberals do, and he has been equally brutal to both groups. Multiple times when I've brought this up, I've been called a Putin supporter, fascist, etc., even though it's an objective fact that just doesn't seem to fit into the liberal worlview in the US. 

There are other examples, but this post is already too long. What do you think? Are many liberals in the US (and elsewhere) guided by similar unobjective ideology/dogmatism as many conservatives? Is this a problem for liberalism?",1624468654.0

For the first time since 2005, a party has won an outright majority. And that party is the party we all know and love, PS. The Socialist Party.

Here is more info regarding the results:

The Socialist Party, the party we all know and love, has won 41.68% of the vote, garnering them a majority of 117 seats, just 1 more of the required 116-seat majority. And it seems as though they won every electoral multi member district in Mainland Portugal and in the Azores Islands. Meanwhile, the Madeira district was won by the Madeiran electoral pact between the Social Democrats, the CDS-People's and the People's Monarchists, which is gonna be talked about below.

The misleadingly-named center-right Social Democratic Party, won 27.8%, giving them 71 seats.

The far-right Chega! got 7.15%, now at third place, garnering themselves 12 deputies, 11 more from the 1 they elected in 2019.

The classical liberal and right-libertarian Liberal Initiative is at 4th, with 4.98%, and giving them 8 seats, 7 more than the 1 deputy they elected in 2019.

Formerly third place, the democratic socialist Left Bloc is now at a dismaying 5th, at 4.46 percent of the vote and 5 seats.

The electoral pact between the Communists and Greens, the CDU, are now at 6th, with 4.39 percent of the vote and 6 seats.

The conservative and Christian democratic CDS-People's Party have fallen from 5th to 7th, with 1.61 percent of the vote and no seats. You heard it right, none, falling from the 5 they had elected in 2019.

The green PAN, is at 8th with 1.53% and 1 deputy.

The LIVRE party, is at 9th with 1.28% of the vote and 1 seat.

The Madeiran electoral coalition between the Social Democrats and the CDS-People's, are at 10th, with 0.94% of the vote and 3 seats.

The Azorean electoral coalition between the Social Democrats, CDS-People's and People's Monarchist, garnered 0.53% of the vote, now at 11th place and 2 seats.

From someone who's country is also a victim of constant Russian state media manipulation that attempts to ignite ethnic tensions. I'm a Latvian and my native language is Russian.

It really shows how out of touch they are. Far away from the conflict, probably too young to follow the news when the 2014 invasion happened & learning nothing from history books to boot.

I live in a country severely affected by Russian state propaganda who have been trying to ignite ethnic tensions between Latvian and Russian speakers ever since Putin got into power. It is the most sleazy and dishonorable kind of manipulation.

Over the years I've seen countless false narratives propagated from Russian state media about how evil our government is and how oppressed the Russian minority here supposedly is. I know those narratives to be false because I am a Russian minority who lives here. They claim I am oppressed and need saving. *I do not*. **THEY LIE**.

More importantly I know the history, culture and context of what they're reporting on to have a more nuanced understanding of what is actually happening. That is not to say that there aren't issues, but they are minor enough for them to be solved in a civil democratic manner. Of course their propaganda articles and news segments often start with a true statement, but it is immediately presented in a very black and white manner and buried under paragraphs of Russian nationalist rhetoric. Sometimes it is more subtle, like ""you're free to reach your own conclusions"" from cherry picked facts. They try to appeal to all sorts of demographics with all sorts of manipulative tactics.

In any case their aim is to put fellow countrymen against one another through waves of disinformation, and then when tensions reach a boiling point they ""step in"" to ""save"" somebody, even though their real goal is to achieve their geopolitical aims. Latvia could have suffered the same fate, but at times like this we are so glad to be in the EU and NATO.

It is a shame that so many of my countrymen have bit the bait of the Russian state media narrative. However with these sanctions and cyber attacks I hope it brings an end to their era of lies.

May our political system break free from ethnic identity politics and move on to solving actual problems with solutions that would benefit us all. Actual social democratic parties would rise and russian nationalist and latvian nationalist parties would diminish.

Without providing solid evidence, our corporate-controlled government and mainstream media portray Maduro as a corrupt, repressive, and illegitimate leader with little to no support.

# Why is the US Corporatocracy so Keen to Remove Maduro?

While Venezuela’s economy is not a strictly-state-run economy, its oil industry is nationalized and uses its revenues for the benefit of its citizens (especially the poor).

After years of crippling US sanctions Maduro stepped over a crucial line in October when his government announced that Venezuela was abandoning the US dollar and would be make all future transactions on the Venezuelan exchange market in euro.

Saddam Hussein also went off the dollar in favor of the euro in 2003 – we started dropping bombs on him the next month.

A similar decision by the Gadhafi government in Libya (2011) was quickly followed by a devastating US-orchestrated conflict - culminating in Gadhafi's capture by radical Islamists who [sodomized him with a bayonet before killing him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUf6ypUz8LI).  Since then, Libya has gone from Africa's wealthiest country to a truly failed-state complete with a slave trade!  To make matters worse, after the collapse of the Libyan government, its military arms were smuggled out of that country and into the hands of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria - enabling US-orchestrated chaos in those countries.

# Who cares what currency a country uses to trade petroleum?

# Answer: US oligarchy

The US dollar is central to US world economic domination.

Like all other modern currencies, it is a fiat currency – backed by no real assets to prop up its value.

In lieu of a “gold standard” we know operate on a de-facto “oil-standard”:

""After the collapse of the Bretton Woods gold standard in the early 1970s, the United States struck a deal with Saudi Arabia to standardize oil prices in dollar terms. Through this deal, the petrodollar system was born, along with a paradigm shift away from pegged exchanged rates and gold-backed currencies to non-backed, floating rate regimes.

The petrodollar system elevated the U.S. dollar to the world's reserve currency and, through this status, the United States enjoys persistent trade deficits and is a global economic hegemony."" [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/072915/how-petrodollars-affect-us-dollar.asp)

“The central banking Ponzi scheme requires an ever-increasing base of demand and the immediate silencing of those who would threaten its existence. Perhaps that is what the hurry \[was\] in removing Gaddafi in particular and those who might have been sympathetic to his monetary idea.” [Anthony Wile](https://www.thedailybell.com/all-articles/editorials/anthony-wile-gaddafi-planned-gold-dinar-now-under-attack/)

# US Foreign Policy is about Oligarchy Not Democracy

Since World War II, [the US has attempted to over-throw the 52 foreign governments](https://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list).  Aside from a handful of exceptions (China, Cuba, Vietnam, etc.), the US has been successful in the vast majority of these attempts.

US foreign policy is not about democracy – it is about exploiting the world’s resources in the interests of a small, ultra-wealthy global elite.

This exploitation benefits a small percentage of people at the top of the economic pyramid while the costs are born by those at the bottom.

# US CIA Coup Playbook:

**How to Plunder Resources from Foreign Countries While Pretending to Support Democracy**

1. Find a country with resources you want.
2. Send in an “[Economic Hitman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuAct1BxHU)” to offer bribes the country’s leader in the form of personally lucrative business deals.  If he accepts the deal, the leader will amass a personal fortune in exchange for ""privatizing” the resources you wish to extract.

If the leader will not accept your bribes, begin the regime-change process.

3) Engage in economic warfare by imposing crippling sanctions on the country and blame the ensuing shortages on the leader’s “socialist” policies.

4) Work with right-wing allies inside country to fund and organize an “[astroturf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)” opposition group behind a corporate-friendly puppet.

5) Hire thugs inside country to incite unrest and violence against the government in coordination with your opposition group.   Use corporate media to publicize the orchestrated outbursts as popular outrage and paint a picture of a “failed state” mired in corruption and chaos.

6) When the government arrests your thugs, decry the response as the brutal repression.  Use corporate-owned media to demonize the target government as a despotic regime while praising your puppet opposition as champions of democracy.

7) Work with right-wing military leaders to organize the overthrow the government (offer them the same business deals the current leader refused).

8) If a military-led coup cannot be organized, create a mercenary army to carry out acts of terrorism against the government and its supporters.  Portray the mercenaries as “freedom fighters” and their acts of terrorism as a “civil war”.

9) If the target government has popular and military support and is too well-defended for your mercenaries to over-throw: label the country a “rouge state” and wait for the right time to invade.  Meanwhile, continue to wear the country’s government and populace down using steps 3 – 8.

10) Escalate the terror campaign within the country to provoke a military response from the country against the US.  If they won’t take the bait , fabricate an attack or threat that you can sell to the US population as justification for an invasion.

11) Once the government is removed, set up your puppet regime to provide the illusion of sovereignty.  The regime will facilitate and legitimize your appropriation of the country’s resources under the guise of ""free"" trade.

12) As you continue to extract the country’s resources, provide intelligence and military support to the puppet regime to suppress popular dissent within the country.

13) Use the demise of the former government as yet another example of the impracticality of “socialism.”

# [‘Venezuela’: Media’s One-Word Rebuttal to the Threat of Socialism](https://fair.org/home/venezuela-medias-one-word-rebuttal-to-the-threat-of-socialism/)

[ALAN MACLEOD](https://twitter.com/AlanRMacLeod) FEBRUARY 8, 2019

A recent Gallup poll ([8/13/18](https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx)) found that a majority of millennials view socialism favorably, preferring it to capitalism. Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is the [most popular](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bernie-sanders-most-popular-politician-poll-trump-favorability-a7913306.html) politician in the United States, while new leftist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (AOC) policies of higher taxes on the wealthy, free healthcare and public college tuition are highly popular—even among Republican voters (FAIR.org,[1/23/19](https://fair.org/home/ocasio-cortez-rattles-pundits-across-the-corporate-media-spectrum/)).

Alarmed by the growing threat of progressive policies at home, the establishment has found a one-word weapon to deploy against the rising tide: Venezuela. The trick is to attack any political figure or movement even remotely on the left by claiming they wish to turn the country into a “socialist wasteland” (Fox News,[ 2/2/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/venezuela-is-the-socialist-wasteland-that-ocasio-cortez-and-fellow-democrats-are-leading-the-u-s-toward)) run by a corrupt dictatorship, leaving its people hungry and devastated.

Leading the charge have been Fox News and other conservative outlets. One Fox opinion piece ([1/25/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dan-bongino-hey-ocasio-cortez-sanders-venezuelas-socialism-has-been-a-disaster-what-say-you)) claimed that Americans should be “absolutely disgusted” by the “fraud” of Bernie Sanders and Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, as they “continue to promote a system that is causing mass starvation and the collapse of a country,” warning that is exactly what their failed socialist policies would bring to the US. (Back in the real world, while Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez identify as socialists, Warren is a self-described [capitalist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-02/why-elizabeth-warren-still-calls-herself-a-capitalist), and Booker is noted for his ties to Wall Street, whose support for his presidential bid he has reportedly been [soliciting](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/wall-street-and-new-york-business-execs-gear-up-for-2020-presidential-election-.html).) A second Fox Newsarticle ([1/27/19](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-now-pushing-many-of-the-same-socialist-policies-that-destroyed-venezuela)) continues in the same vein, warning that, “At the heart of Venezuela’s collapse is a laundry list of socialist policies that have decimated its economy.”

*The* *Wall Street Journal* *(*[*1/28/19*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialists-of-the-world-unite-11548722544)*) describes calls for negotiations in Venezuela as “siding with the dictator.”*

In an article entitled “Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn and the Starving Children of Venezuela,” the Washington Examiner ([6/15/17](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/bernie-sanders-jeremy-corbyn-and-the-starving-children-of-venezuela)) warned its readers to “beware the socialist utopia,” describing it as a dystopia where children go hungry thanks to socialism. The Wall Street Journal ([1/28/19](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socialists-of-the-world-unite-11548722544)) recently condemned Sanders for his support of a “dictator,” despite the fact Bernie has [strongly criticized](http://inthesetimes.com/article/21697/democrats-president-donald-trump-coup-venezuela-juan-guaido-nicolas-maduro) Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and dismissed Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, as a “dead Communist dictator” (Reuters,[ 6/1/16](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-usa/venezuelas-maduro-rooting-for-revolutionary-friend-sanders-in-u-s-campaign-idUSKCN0YN32Q)).

More supposedly centrist publications have continued this line of attack. The New York Times’ Bret Stephens ([1/25/19](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/opinion/venezuela-maduro-socialism-government.html)) argued: “Venezuela is a socialist catastrophe. In the age of AOC, the lesson must be learned again”—namely, that “socialism never works,” as “20 years of socialism” has led to “the ruin of a nation.” The Miami Herald([2/1/19](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article225431885.html)) cast shame on Sanders and AOC for arguing for socialism in the face of such overwhelming evidence against it, describing the left’s refusal to back self-appointed president **Juan Guaidó, someone whom** [**less than 20 percent**](https://www.thenation.com/article/venezuela-coup-guaido-maduro/) **of Venezuelans had even heard of**, let alone voted for, as “morally repugnant.”

**This useful weapon to be used against the left can only be sustained by withholding a great number of key facts—chief among them, the US role in Venezuela’s devastation. US sanctions, according to the Venezuelan opposition’s economics czar, are responsible for a halving of the country’s oil output (FAIR.org, 12/17/18). The UN Human Rights Council has formally condemned the US and discussed reparations to be paid, with one UN special rapporteur describing Trump’s sanctions as a possible “crime against humanity” (London Independent, 1/26/19). This has not been reported by any the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN or any other national US “resistance” news outlet, which have been only too quick to support Trump’s regime change plans (FAIR.org, 1/25/19).**

**Likewise, the local US-backed opposition’s role in the economic crisis is barely mentioned. The opposition, which controls much of the country’s food supply, has officially accepted responsibility for conducting an “economic war” by withholding food and other key goods.**

**For example, the monolithic Empresas Polar controls the majority of the flour production and distribution crucial for making arepa cornbread, Venezuela’s staple food. Polar’s chair is Leopoldo Lopez, national coordinator of Juan Guaidó’s Popular Will party, while its president is Lorenzo Mendoza, who considered running for president against Maduro in the 2018 elections that caused pandemonium in the media (FAIR.org, 5/23/18).**

**Conspicuously, it’s the products that Polar has a near-monopoly in that are often in shortest supply. This is hardly a secret, but never mentioned in the copious stories (CNN, 5/14/14, Bloomberg, 3/16/17, Washington Post, 5/22/17, NPR, 4/7/17) focusing on bread lines in the country.**

**Also rarely commented on was the fact that multiple international election observer missions declared the 2018 elections free and fair, and that Venezuelan government spending as a proportion of GDP (often considered a barometer of socialism) is actually lower than the US’s, and far lower than most of Europe’s, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation.**

*The London* *Daily Express* *(*[*2/3/19*](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1081839/labour-news-jeremy-corbyn-jo-cox-venezuela)*) demonstrates that redbaiting works equally well on either side of the Atlantic.*

Regardless of these bothersome facts, the media has continued to present Venezuela’s supposedly socialist dictatorship as solely responsible for its crisis as a warning to any progressives who get the wrong idea. So useful is this tool that it is being used to attack progressive movements around the world. The Daily Express ([2/3/19](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1081839/labour-news-jeremy-corbyn-jo-cox-venezuela)) and Daily Mail ([2/3/19](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6662757/Corbyn-allies-rally-round-Labour-leader-Venezuelas-socialist-president-Maduro.html)) condemned UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for his “defense” of a “dictator,” while the Daily Telegraph([2/3/19](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/02/03/venezuela-labours-blueprint-britain/)) warned that the catastrophe of Venezuela is Labour’s blueprint for Britain. Meanwhile, the Greek leftist party Syriza’s support for Maduro (the official position of [three-quarters](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14303) of UN member states) was condemned as “shameful” (London Independent, [1/29/19](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-us-sanctions-alexis-tsipras-greece-support-a8751771.html)).

“Venezuela” is also used as a one-word response to shut down debate and counter any progressive idea or thought. While the panel on ABC’s The View ([7/23/18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vW32S19vp0k)) discussed progressive legislation like Medicare for All and immigration reform, conservative regular Meghan McCain responding by invoking Venezuela: “They’re starving to death” she explained, leaving the other panelists bemused.

President Trump has also used it. In response to criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren over his “Pocahontas” jibe, he replied that she would “make our country into Venezuela” (Reuters,[ 10/15/18](https://reuters.com/video/2018/10/15/warren-would-destroy-the-country-trump?videoId=473661112&videoChannel=1003)).

The weapon’s effectiveness can only be sustained through a media in lockstep with the government’s regime-change goals. That the media is fixated on the travails of a relatively small and unimportant country in America’s “backyard,” and that the picture of Venezuela is so shallow, is not a mistake. Rather, the simplistic narrative of a socialist dictatorship starving its own people provides great utility as a weapon for the establishment to beat back the domestic “threat” of socialism, by associating movements and figures such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jeremy Corbyn with an evil caricature they have carefully crafted.

# Corporate Propaganda Blitz Against Venezuela’s Elected President: MSM Will Not Let Facts Interfere With Coup Agenda

[Facts Don’t Interfere With Propaganda Blitz Against Venezuela’s Elected President](https://fair.org/home/facts-dont-interfere-with-propaganda-blitz-against-venezuelas-elected-president/)  [Joe Emersberger](https://fair.org/author/joe/)

**Guaidó, anointed by Trump and a new Iraq-style Coalition of the Willing, did not even run in Venezuela’s May 2018 presidential election. In fact, shortly before the election, Guaidó was not even mentioned by the opposition-aligned pollster Datanálisis when it published approval ratings of various prominent opposition leaders. Henri Falcón, who actually did run in the election (defying US threats against him) was claimed by the pollster to basically be in a statistical tie for most popular among them. It is remarkable to see the Western media dismiss this election as “fraudulent,” without even attempting to show that it was “stolen“ from Falcón. Perhaps that’s because it so clearly wasn’t stolen.**

**Graph: Approval Ratings of Main Venezuelan Leaders Nov 2016 - July 2018 Data from the opposition-aligned pollsters in Venezuela (via Torino Capital) indicates that Henri Falcón was the most popular of the major opposition figures at the time of the May 2018 presidential election. Nicolás Maduro won the election due to widespread opposition boycotting and votes drawn by another opposition candidate, Javier Bertucci.**

**The constitutional argument that Trump and his accomplices have used to “recognize” Guaidó rests on the preposterous claim that Maduro has “abandoned” the presidency by soundly beating Falcón in the election. Caracas-based journalist Lucas Koerner took apart that argument in more detail.**

What about the McClatchy-owned Miami Herald's claim that Maduro “continues to reject international aid”? In November 2018, following a [public appeal](https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/14147) by Maduro, the UN did authorize emergency aid for Venezuela. It was even reported by Reuters ([11/26/18](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-un/u-n-approves-9-million-in-aid-for-crisis-stricken-venezuela-idUSKCN1NV2AR)), whose headlines have often broadcast the [news agency’s contempt](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-imports-exclusive/exclusive-as-venezuelans-suffer-maduro-buys-foreign-oil-to-subsidize-cuba-idUSKCN1IG1TO) for Maduro’s government.

It’s not unusual for Western media to ignore facts they have themselves reported when a major “[propaganda blitz](http://www.medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/2019/893-venezuela-blitz-part-2-press-freedom-sanctions-and-oil.html)” by Washington is underway against a government. For example, it was generally reported accurately in 1998 that UN weapons inspectors were withdrawn from Iraq ahead of air strikes ordered by Bill Clinton, not expelled by Iraq’s government. But by 2002, it became a staple of pro-war propaganda that Iraq had expelled weapons inspectors (Extra! Update, [10/02](https://fair.org/extra/what-a-difference-four-years-makes/)).

And, incidentally, when a Venezuelan NGO requested aid from the UN-linked Global Fund in 2017, it was [turned down](https://plataformalac.org/en/2017/02/global-fund-denies-humanitarian-support-to-hiv-people-of-venezuela/). Setting aside how effective foreign aid is at all (the [example of Haiti](https://haitiliberte.com/the-oxfam-sex-scandal-the-role-of-ngos-today-journalist-kim-ives-speaks-with-sharmini-peries-of-the-real-news-network/) hardly makes a great case for it), it is supposed to be distributed based on relative need, not based on how badly the US government wants somebody overthrown.

But **the potential for “aid” to alleviate Venezuela’s crisis is negligible compared to the destructive impact of US economic sanctions.** Near the end of the Miami Herald article, author Jim Wyss cited an estimate from the thoroughly demonized Venezuelan government that US sanctions have cost it $30 billion, with no time period specified for that estimate. Again, this calls to mind the run-up to the Iraq invasion, when completely factual statements that [Iraq had no WMDs](https://fair.org/take-action/media-advisories/star-witness-on-iraq-said-weapons-were-destroyed/) were attributed to the discredited Iraqi government. Quoting Iraqi denials supposedly balanced the lies spread in the media by US officials like John Bolton, who now leads the charge to overthrow Maduro. Wyss could have cited economists independent of the Maduro government on the impact of US sanctions—like US economist [Mark Weisbrot](https://therealnews.com/stories/new-oil-sanctions-on-venezuela-would-destroy-whats-left-of-its-economy), or the emphatically anti-Maduro Venezuelan economist [Francisco Rodríguez](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/12/why-more-sanctions-wont-help-venezuela/).

**Illegal US sanctions were first imposed in 2015 under a fraudulent “state of emergency” declared by Obama, and subsequently extended by Trump. The revenue lost to Venezuela’s government due to US economic sanctions since August 2017, when the impact became very easy to quantify, is by now** [**well over $6 billion**](https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/14073)**. That’s enormous in an economy that was only able to import about $11 billion of goods in 2018, and needs about $2 billion per year in medicines. Trump’s “recognition” of Guaidó as “interim president” was the pretext for making the already devastating sanctions much worse. Last month, Francisco Rodríguez revised his projection for the change in Venezuela’s real GDP in 2019, from an 11 percent contraction to 26 percent, after the intensified sanctions were announced.**

**The $20 million in US “aid” that Wyss is outraged Maduro won’t let in is a rounding error compared to the billions already lost from Trump’s sanctions.**

Former US Ambassador to Venezuela William Brownfield, who pressed for more sanctions on Venezuela, dispensed with the standard “humanitarian” cover that US officials have offered for them (**Intercept**, [2/10/19](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/10/intercepted-podcast-vijay-prashad-venezuela-india/)):

>And if we can do something that will bring that end quicker, we probably should do it, but we should do it understanding that it’s going to have an impact on millions and millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat, getting themselves cured when they get sick, or finding clothes to put on their children before they go off to school. We don’t get to do this and pretend as though it has no impact there. We have to make the hard decision—the desired outcome justifies this fairly severe punishment.

How does this gruesome candor get missed by reporters like Wyss, and go unreported in his article?

**Speaking of “severe punishment,” if the names John Bolton and Elliott Abrams don’t immediately call to mind the punishment they should be receiving for crimes against humanity, it illustrates how well the Western propaganda system functions. Bolton, a prime facilitator of the Iraq War,** [**recently suggested**](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/02/01/yiiiiikes-john-bolton-threatens-send-venezuelas-maduro-offshore-us-prison-guantanamo) **that Maduro could be sent to a US-run torture camp in Cuba. Abrams played a key role in** [**keeping US support flowing**](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/1/30/allan_nairn_trump_s_venezuela_envoy) **to mass murderers and torturers in Central America during the 1980s. Also significant that Abrams, brought in by Trump to help oust Maduro, used “humanitarian aid”** [**as cover to supply weapons**](https://twitter.com/kgosztola/status/1091848921771638785) **to the US-backed Contra terrorists in Nicaragua.**

In the Miami Herald article, the use of US “aid” for military purposes is presented as another allegation made by the vilified Venezuelan president: “Maduro has repeatedly said the aid is cover for a military invasion and has ordered his armed forces not to let it in, even as food and medicine shortages sweep the country.”

"The Social Democratic Federation of the United States of America, 1936 - 1957",Liberal,17,r8kl4r,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/r8kl4r/the_social_democratic_federation_of_the_united/,0,"The Social Democratic Federation of the United States of America (SDF) was formed in 1936 by a faction of the Socialist Party of America called the Old Guard, in response to the rise of the ""Militant"" faction in the party, young radical members:

 ""*It all began with the formation of groups in the Socialist Party that wanted to commit it to direct action. ""Direct action"" means that an organized group will take any action, illegal as well as legal, that it believes will bring about the reform, changes, or objective it seeks. The general strike for political purposes, sabotage, the use of violence, the spread of fear, the paralysis of industry, trade, commerce, and even government are examples... The direct-action groups in the Socialist Party called themselves Militants; some formed the Revolutionary Policy Committee; others used other names. When they first appeared on the scene, they wore blue shirts and adopted the upraised arm and the clenched fist as a form of salute. They insisted that the party coin flamboyant slogans, organize street demonstrations, arrange great protest rallies, and in general, do the things that the Communists had made popular in their day-to-day activities. In due time, organizations of students, youths, tenants, housewives, and the unemployed formed by the Socialist group entered ""United Fronts"" with like organizations under Communist auspices. The fronts became transmission belts for the Communists... Most of the fronts sought to carry out the objectives of Soviet foreign policy, to glorify the Soviet system, and to spread confusion in the ranks of society. We were convinced that by engaging in United Front activities, we, who were opposed to Communist aims, would soon become witting or unwitting parties to the furtherance of those aims and to the destruction of democracy.*""  

The Old Guard called itself such because they believed they represented the Socialist Party's traditional commitment to democracy and reformism, and opposition to communism. In response to the declarations at the party convention in 1934, which the Militants had gained great influence in the party, the Old Guard formed the Committee for the Preservation of the Socialist Party, which would become the Social Democratic Federation. It affiliated itself with the Socialist International. Unlike the Socialist Party, which ran its own candidate, Norman Thomas, the SDF supported FDR and the New Deal. In 1957 it merged back into the Socialist Party, its ideas winning as from this point on the Socialist Party supported progressive Democrats rather than running third party in elections.",1638603826.0
Some folks were saying this place used to be Libertarian but the mods allowed it to be taken over by non libertarians but a key aspect of Libertarianism is free speech so technically speaking banning those who didn't represent Libertarian views would go counter to the views of Libertarianism.,Conservative,118,sr1vg3,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/sr1vg3/some_folks_were_saying_this_place_used_to_be/,72,"Idk, it's just a random thing I noticed. My personal opinion on this claim is that Libertarianism has multiple forms. Right wing, left wing and probably anarchism to some extend, each differ in their own ways and all have different approaches on I guess to achieve true libertarianism. 

I'm pretty ok with having a wilder range of variety but it seems like this might be an issue for some folks which is pretty understandable. 

From what I've seen in the posts on this place the content seems to be pretty Libertarian but with just enough variety in our views that it doesn't just become a circlejerk. 

We discuss, we argue and we don't always disagree and that's ok. Even if this were to be a specific type of Libertarian sub only the mods would only end up being massive hypocrites if they ended up banning folks who didn't align with their view of Libertarianism. 

One of the core beliefs of Libertarianism stops the mods from banning folks (unless they blatantly break reddit's rules) 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think this place has a variety or not and do you think that's a good or bad thing. 

My personal beliefs in politics is that while I may disagree with many folks and agree with others from both sides on certain matters it's never wise to get angry at what other people believe in. They're entitled to their own beliefs as am I.",1644701745.0

The Cheating Wife/Woman and how her story sometimes tragically ends (in fiction and reality),Liberal,26,mff02f,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/mff02f/the_cheating_wifewoman_and_how_her_story/,27,"Cheating has been going on since, well as long as humans have been around basically. Desire is a part of us and we often act on it. Sex is one of our primary and greatest desires (unless you're asexual and nothing bad about that, just to make it clear). In relationships we know people sometimes desire others when they're already with someone. Sometimes they pursue the other person/people and sometimes they don't. Sometimes it remains a secret and other times it doesn't...but...what happens...when the secret is revealed...bad things may happen.

Now men cheat too, it happens and they do get confronted too, sometimes attacked (which isn't great either). I'm not saying it isn't understandable why someone would get mad at learning someone they're with had cheated. But what some do once they've learned the truth...is horrifying.

Now, it seems that in fiction, there's a difference in how often a cheating man is presented in contrast to a cheating woman. In one film (which I can't remember and didn't watch), but a man who had a wheelchair-bound wife as a result of an accident they were in (and she blames him for while taking her anger out on him while seeking some kind of miracle cure) and he has an affair with a woman (who is also married) yet it's supposed to represent a means of sympathy for him. That his affair is understandable and that he isn't bad for what he does. (There's also the matter of his wife being found dead and him being suspected of it, but I didn't watch the film so I don't know what happened.) This isn't to say how it's always presented, but it speaks as to how the cheating man is portrayed.

However, in the 1995 film Above Suspicion, a woman cheats on her paralyzed husband...and...I don't know what happened to her and her lover...but I saw some horrifying comments online that they 'deserved what happened'...and I know her husband planned their murder from the hypnosis...and I think he got away with it (didn't watch the movie). But it's framed in more than one 'colorful' way by people that she deserved what happened to her because she was cheating on him. We see women humiliated, degraded, beaten...and murdered because they cheated on a man. Women will be threatened with guns...or gunned down by men once they learned of the affairs.

Here's two links that shows in regards to the film I mentioned how some say what happened to the lady was deserved:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDxt8G0n6lM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDxt8G0n6lM)

[https://letterboxd.com/realy\_bad/film/above-suspicion-1995/](https://letterboxd.com/realy_bad/film/above-suspicion-1995/)

In our world, there are men who have murdered their wives, fiancés, and girlfriends for learning they cheated on them. The women's deaths have been all kinds of horrifying and cruel. And fiction reflects this. Women die usually cruel deaths at the hands of men for being in affairs and people will say they deserved it, that they were glad it happened. Some say it should be expected if cheating happens. One guy on a site said he'd be glad to find out his wife was cheating so he could, as he said, decapitate her. And there are...stories where women have met such fates for cheating.

I know cheating is a sore spot for people and it garners heated attitudes from some. Some despise it no matter what, some perhaps aren't judgmental, but the 'popular' perspective is contempt. (I have never been in a relationship or been with anyone, but I find it complicated...and I certainly don't believe someone should be killed for being in/having an affair. As a guy, I don't know if this means more or less for what I'm saying. Maybe this is a statement coming from privilege...I don't know...but I felt regardless, it's something that should be said.)

Yes, men have died for being involved in affairs and this is also terrible. When we look at it, it's often the men a woman is cheating with (as in the movie I said and in other fiction, such as the movie Shooting the Warwicks where a cheating wife and the man she slept are murdered by her husband...and in several crime shows the same thing happens). Yet we also see where the women men cheat with are killed, but not the man at the hands of the/because of the wife as a way to 'punish' the cheating man. The women die, but he lives. We really don't, or don't usually, see this in the opposite case. The cheating woman and man die, or just the cheating wife.

Just...the women dying...for just embracing/acting on desires...is terrible...and it's cruel that men can/do get away with it. A few decades ago in Kentucky, a man learned his wife was sleeping with a Senator's son and murdered them both, but got away scot free because it was 'a matter of honor'. Men have murdered cheating women for millennia and gotten away with it, hell, they're often celebrated/uplifted for 'giving the woman what she deserved'.

No one should die for being involved in/having an affair. If someone thinks they should/tries to kill that person for cheating, they deserve to be cheated on. (A controversial opinion/perspective, I admit...but the suffering of women is often some of the worst when she acts on her desires...and society applauds when she gets her 'just desserts'.)

(I'm sorry for the rant...but...I keep coming across these stories, both in reality and in fiction...and I couldn't keep not saying something. Such stories replay in my mind constantly, and my heart breaks, my blood boils...and I cry...I know this may flair tempers and some may call me insane for this...but...women shouldn't die for being involved in affairs...)",1616982119.0

And as a result, I try and read stuff to the left of me and see if I find it convincing or not. And so I have read like actual radical leftist literature, workers revolution type deal. And seeing Republicans call democrats radical leftists literally makes me burst out laughing. They aren't even leftists, let alone radical militant leftists.

Anyways, here is a comment I left on that post, but I would love to hear your thoughts, what do you think would actually happen if Republicans met a real militant leftist?

Post in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/sys2nh/an_11_point_plan_to_rescue_america_rick_scott/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I always wonder how these guys would react if they actually met someone from the actual radical left. The dems aren't leftists, no matter how much Republicans like to paint them as such. Hell even ""radical bernie"" is fairly moderate as socialists go (some would argue he isn't even socialist. Fun fact, I was reading a communist newspaper and it said Sanders was basically evil because he still supported racist imperialism, etc).

Anyways, I seriously wonder what would happen if a Republican like this guy actually met a radical leftist. I'm talking full on Kroptokin style anarcho-communist, or hell like a libertarian Marxist or even a frickin tankie.

I am to the left of most people in this sub (market socialist), but like, I'm still fairly committed to the democratic process as opposed to the workers revolution the radical militant left actually wants.

Idk, like, I guess these guys have no idea what socialism or ""the left"" actually is. You can disagree with socialist policies,  that's fine, but like, at least actually know what you're talking about? Have a clear definition of what the word you so hate means? Cause you know who else hates the dems and Biden? Communists.

Hell, you know what real hard core communist types call someone like sanders? A ""radical liberal"". Idk I find that deeply funny, weird how hard-core marxists (yes ik not all Communists are marxists and not all marxists are communist, just roll with me here), and conservatives use the same word to describe their political opponent. They mean totally different things by radical and liberal.

Yeah I'd love to see this guy talk to like an actual revolutionary Marxist type. That would be entertaining to watch lol.",1645595601.0

"Been dreaming up a new political system, curious if it was popular here?",Liberal,2,3jugy2,Communist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Communist/comments/3jugy2/been_dreaming_up_a_new_political_system_curious/,0,"I don't have much experience with politics but have been constructing this idea of a new system based on what seems most natural to me. People dislike the notion that a few hundred have the power to control millions. There isn't much of a way around this, but it should be possible to create a political system and government that better represents the populous, and more precisely to represent our best selves. My version of this “proportional representation” is as follows:

Everyone comes together to form groups of between one and three hundred people. These groups are geographically based and so every four years one must attend a local hall with your ""roughly"" 150 neighbours and vote on two representatives, largest proportion of votes wins. Understandably, fewer groups would be 'based' in rural Scotland than groups based in cities, per square mile.

The second step is how the political system is thus built upon this foundation. Assuming an average size of 150 people per group, in the UK there would be 400,000 groups, and these would be gathered into clumps of 10, each clump representing 10 neighbouring groups, and so about 1500 people. The two elected representatives of each group would come together and the twenty of them would represent the 2000 part time. This is the first rung/tier of the political system and the twenty of them would act as a sort of neighbourhood leader. Every four years they would vote for two of them to move to the next rung.

This second tier would form after 10 neighbouring pairs of ""first tier representatives"" came together and the twenty representatives would represent their collective 15,000. This second tier, would be paid a decent salary, would fulfil a role similar to an mp or district/county council, and serve a 4 year spell. The twenty men/women in the second tier would also vote for two of them to go on to represent in the third tier.

The third tier: This would constitute the two representatives of ten second tier groups coming together and representing their collective 150,000 people. Finally, the twenty in the third tier would nominate 1 person to enter a final tier of around 400 people. These 400 people would hold a position that could be comparable to the present-day government. The 400 would be composed of two groups of 200, in the UK there would be a northern group and a southern group. This is where the normal citizens can vote again. 5 representatives from each group of 200 will campaign much like the present day system and two of them will be voted through to fulfil the figurehead/leader role.

(Oh and the thing about pairs acting as representatives of the populous was partly inspired by the Roman democracy before the Emperors became a thing.

Negative rights seem to be one of the hallmarks of libertarianism. So, in that case, is land use a natural right? Someone has to actively restrict me from using most of the land in the USA, to actively restrict me from cutting down trees or building something on said land, living off of it.

And, on a very practical level, I am very curious; humans are animals, after all, and we don't deprive *other* animals the right to use land.

Perhaps unlike air, land is exhaustible, so it naturally gets some market value. But, what if everyone was given a plot of somewhere on an order of magnitude of an acre? With 2.4 billion acres in the USA, the 330 million population, that would only add up to about 13% of the land in the USA. 

I'm not advocating here, I'm actually just curious and am trying to work this problem out myself. I would really like it if more people had access to land, personally.

"The NTOA, an organization that provides training guidelines and certifications for SWAT teams across the country, has released a statement saying they no longer support the use of “No Knock” raids.",Conservative,90,t1bt6n,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/t1bt6n/the_ntoa_an_organization_that_provides_training/,12,"This could drastically decrease, if not completely eliminate the use of no knock raids in the United States.

***copied from my work email.  This was forwarded to the entire department by the SWAT commander who received it directly from NTOA.***

This message is shared on behalf of the NTOA and its Board of Directors.

 

No-knock warrant service has been the subject of many discussions over the past 30 years. These conversations often result in vigorous and passionate debates, and more often than not end with an agreement to disagree. Recent high-profile incidents have refocused the spotlight on this issue, resulting in renewed scrutiny and making no-knock warrants a key issue in the police reform movement.

 

We at the NTOA have had this same experience and are intimately aware of the complexities of this topic. As experienced law enforcement professionals, we appreciate the challenges facing policing, and our intent is not to add to those difficulties.

 

We can all agree that there is no easy answer, but there is a correct answer: No-knock search warrants, though well-intended, no longer pass the test of tactical science, risk mitigation practices, and liability-conscious decision-making.

﻿

The NTOA’s position on this is not new, nor is it a surrender to the forces of change. Still, we appreciate that this blunt and definitive statement is likely to cause angst and believe we must explain our reasoning.

 

﻿The NTOA was created with a mission to help save lives through training, education and tactical excellence, and has been teaching and writing about the no-knock issue for years. This mission has not changed.

 

No-knock is a legal/judicial exception to the constitutional knock-and-announce requirement. No-knock warrants became popular within policing during the “War on Drugs” of the 1980s. The fact that those dealing in illegal narcotics were often armed and had criminal histories involving violence, coupled with the threat of evidence destruction, created a dangerous challenge for law enforcement. As a result, law enforcement adopted the tactics of surprise, speed, and “violence of action” (intimidation). Law enforcement hoped that this combination would quickly overwhelm any resistance and avoid injuries.

 

The no-knock exception was the critical element to the surprise component of the tactics. It wasn’t long before no-knock became synonymous with dynamic entry/movement. Even today, the two terms are inextricably linked. The no-knock became a tactic used for many, if not most, warrants during the 1980s and early to mid-1990s. More often than not, these missions were successful, sometimes despite ourselves. Unfortunately, we also began to notice a pattern of SWAT officers losing their lives or being seriously injured. Multiple incidents of loss of life forced the NTOA and many agencies to re-examine how we managed risk and to seek alternatives to the no-knock “tactic.”

 

For years, the NTOA has advocated for the priority of safety and life, which drives strategic decision-making and critical thinking for the development of operational plans and orders. Tactical leaders and supervisors create these plans daily while sending personnel into harm’s way. These safety priorities are well known to all of us, but as a reminder, they are:

 

__1. Hostages/victims

__2. Innocent bystanders

__3. Public safety personnel (Police, EMS, Fire)

__4. Suspect(s)

__5. Drugs/evidence (Controlling objective)

 

Agencies initially used no-knock search warrants to protect the officer from violence and preserve evidence for the prosecution. Though the intent sounds reasonable and is noble in theory, the practice is flawed at its very core. Evidence is the controlling objective for most search warrants, which is the reason for the warrant’s planning and service. Though it is the controlling objective, we must apply sound risk mitigation principles to the problem to better serve the ultimate end state: “suspect(s) in custody and investigation to continue.” We understand the priorities of safety and life. We know from a critical thinking perspective how to build proper strategy to provide effective tactical resolution to the problem while maximizing safety.

 

For example, if the warrant is for the recovery of drugs, the no-knock warrant purpose is to preserve evidence. The safety priorities ensure the safety of the officers, innocent bystanders, and the suspect before preserving evidence. If the no-knock warrant is used based on the propensity of violence, this further violates the safety priorities. Stealth entry, approach, breaching of the door, crossing the threshold, or other covert means of access only risk the following scenarios:

 

__• The misidentification by the occupants of the police as intruders;

__• The compression of space and time negatively affects the ability to correctly interpret situations and the environment for both the police and occupants;

__• The misidentification of intent on the part of occupants and the police;

__• Police create an environment along with the suspect’s intentional or unintentional actions requiring correct interpretation from both sides, which often does not occur, leading to an unfortunate tragedy.

 

The NTOA’s template for sound, defensible risk mitigation is straightforward. Consider all aspects of the mission, including the objective(s), intelligence and applicable legal constraints. Next, consider all of the tactical options at your disposal, and then using the safety priorities, select the safest alternative possible to accomplish your mission. Finally, have the flexibility to adjust to the circumstances (exigency) as they present themselves.

 

The strategy and tactics developed on a search warrant should always speak to the safety priorities based on intelligence known to the officers. Applying tools and tactics that can be justified and supported by risk mitigation and the safety of all concerned within the environment is mandatory.

 

When considering the priority of safety and life, it is difficult, at best, to justify or defend no-knock warrant service. Lessons learned over many years and our desire not to repeat our past mistakes are the foundation for our position.

Can a society afford Universal Basic Income?,Liberal,5,shb1h9,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/shb1h9/can_a_society_afford_universal_basic_income/,6,"This is the fundamental sticking point of the UBI proposal(s). Many people do not believe that a society can afford UBI - that funding this for everyone would lead to everyone being impoverished.

That argument leaves me with a strong distaste - it directly implies that the person believes that it's necessary for people to exist in the margins in order for the rest of us to enjoy a reasonably comfortable life.

But if we dig even further and realize that the 99% of us exist on a mere 2% of the available resource pie, and most of us are able to meet our basic needs, that we could take some of that 98% of resources that we simply never even see, and use that to bring everyone up.

[Per the World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/poverty-rate-by-state), between 7 and 20% of people in the USA live in poverty. That implies that the remaining 92-79% of people are consuming the bulk of that 2% share of the resource pie.

If we increased that share to a mere 3%, that extra 1% alone would ensure that everyone had their basic needs met, and no one lived in poverty any longer.

I've grown to realize that the people who oppose UBI fail to recognize just how much of our resources have been funnelled to the 1%, and we simply never even see those resources in circulation.

There's far more out there than we realize. No one except for the 1% needs to spend a dime to see UBI realized. Nor Universal Health Care, or universal education.

I was recently having an argument with my right libertarian father and brought up the productivity-pay gap as something that helps keep poor people trapped even though they are working hard.

He brought an angle I was skeptical off but hadn't fully examined:

He argued that basically capital is now more productive than before, and this accounted for the gap because it means capital is more productive than labor.

My gut reaction is to say: well generally speaking, the more productive capital is, the more productive labor is, so those two should relatively correlate. Why? Well, more productive capital means less actual labor is needed for to produce the same number of goods, and since output increases, labor contribution must as well, otherwise output would remain constant. However, I am not aware of any economist or study that has examined whether increased capital productivity accounts for the productivity-pay gap.

I share Smith’s view that we were not in a strike wave, but I have some differences with his reasoning and with his choice of historical reference points. Specifically, the decline of the labor movement is not explained by a decline in profit rates, but rather by institutional transformations that have hemmed in the labor movement’s tactics and ultimately changed what kind of labor movement we have.

**Bio:**

Lenin was born in the town of Sibirsk (now Ulyanovsk) on April 22 1870, as Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov into a family of petty Bourgeosie minor nobles. Lenin was one of 8 siblings. In 1886 his father died suddenly of a brain Haemorrhage, an event that allegedlly caused Lenin to become an atheist. Just one year later Lenin's older brother (Alexander) was hung for being involved in Socialist politics and protests/a plot to assassanate the the Czar this even was a catalyst to Lenin's Radicalization and installed a deep hatred of the Czarist regime in him. In 1887 Lenin enterd the Kazan univercity, here he joined a student organisation (Zemlyachestvo) during this time he would lead protests over Czarist laws which had recently banned the student organisations, for this action he was arrested, expelled from the univercity and temporaraly confined to his family's estate. After a few months he was allowed to return to Kazan, however not to the Univercity during this time Lenin became aware of thr writings of Karl Marx and read *Das Capital*.

In 1889 Lenin relocated with his family to Samara, here he increasingly go involved in underground Socialist political groups, and became fully devoted to Marxism, this was in contrast to most Russian Socialists at the time, who wer agrarian Socialist of the Narodnik movement, one which from this time onwards Lenin would frequently critisize. In 1893 Lenin moved to Saint Petersburg and became involved in undergound Marxist groups, he also first met his future wife - Nadezhda Krupskaya during his time in the city. During the 1890s Lenin Left Russia and traveled around Europe, meating Socialist party/group leaders and theorists as well as collecting liturature which he covertly smuggled back into Russia. Due to smuggling the Socialist theory into Russia, translating it and attemting to distribute it to the proletariate, the Police arrested Lenin and several other Socialists with connections to him. In 1897 he was sentenced to 3 years exile in Siberia for the crime of 'sedition'. Lenin was exiled to the remote Siberian town of Shushenskoye, during his time here he was joined by Nadezhda Krupskaya due to her having organised a workers strike. After having completed his stint in Siberia, Lenin went into exile in Western Europe (primarily Switzerland) where he continued to write socialist articles which were clandestinely spread in Russia, during his time in exile in Europe he also met with other Marxists exiles including Leon Trotsky. In 1903 the Second Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) conference was held in London, during the conference Lenin's ideas caused friction and a split within the Party, this lead to the creation of two factions within the RSDLP the Majority faction (the Bolsheviks) led by Lenin, and the Minority faction who were more reformist than revolutionary (the Mensheviks) the two factions were soon locked in a bitter feud.

During the 1905 Revolution Lenin wrote numous articles urging the Bolshevilks to take an active role in leading the revolution, and to use violent and extream tactics whenever nessassary, this was justified by Lenin as he saw that the revolution was at risk of being compromised by it's Liberal wing, which were happy with the Czarist consestions of setting up a Duma and adopting a constitution, rather than what the Socialist Wing of the revolution aimed to achieve - a Proletarian workers state. His views on the Revolution were, predictably, condemed by the Menshaviks. despite Lenin's predition about the revolution coming true, he felt that it was safe enough to return to Russia during this time. After returing, Lenin became an editor for the revolutionary newspaper *Novaya zhizn*, and arranged for various acts of theift and robbery, most notably the Tflis Bank robbery of  1907, which was overseen by Lenin's close associate  Joseph Jugashvili. These activities caught the attention of the Czarist Secret police ( the Okrana) an Lenin was forced to flee again int exile in Europe in 1907. during his second stint of exile Lenin Lenin kept in close contact with Bolsheviks who remained in Russia, giving them advise and his opinons via letters. In 1910 Lenin visited the eighth congress of the Second International. Lenin was visited by Joseph Stalin in 1913 while he was in exile and they discussed amoung other things, how the ethnic minorities would be treated in a post revolutionary Russia.

Lenin was in Austro-Hungarian Galicia when the First world War broke out, due to his Russian citizenship he was briefly detained before being release once it was clear that he was not a Romanov agent. After this Lenin returned to Switzerland. Lenin condemed the German Social Democratic party for supporting the German war effort, which ran in contrast to the Second International's resolution to oppose the conflict. In February 1917 the Feburuary Revolution dethroned Czar Nicholas II and replaced his autocratic rule with the Liberal-Democratic provisional government. The provisional Government was initially very popular but soon lost most of it's support due to it's insistence on continueing the war. Lenin was happy when he hear the news about the revolution and managed to convinced the German government to allow him and several other revolutionaries to board a train for Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) (the Germans beleive that the revolutionaries would hurt the Russian war effort so agreed to this proposal) once back in Russia Lenin was greeted by eager crowds of Bolsheviksa and their supporters at the train station, here Lenin gave a speach critisizing the provisional government, urging an end to the war and that all power be given to the Soviets (Workers Councils)

Between July  16-20th 1917 Bolshevik supporters clashed with troops loyal to the Provisional government during *The July Days.* Following this, the provisional government cracked down on the Bolsheviks and raided their offices and issued an arrest warrent for Lenin, accusing him of being a German agent. Lenin had to go into hiding in a series of safe houses. In august an attempted coup was lauched againt the provisional government by General Kornilov, to defeat this, the leader of the Provisional governement (Alexander Kerensky) allowed Leon Trotskey and other bolsheviks to rally their supporters into an armed force known as the Red Guard in order to defend Petrograd and conduct sabotage to slow down the coup forces. the reactionary coup was soon defeated by the workers and the bolsheviks had a huge boost in both their power and their popularity. Sensing that it was now safe to do so, Lenin came out of hiding and retured to Petrograd. Once back in Petrograd Lenin called a meeting of the Bolshevik leadership and after a vote, it was ageed that a revolution was needed to overthrow the Liberal-Bourgeous Provisional Government in onder to establish a proletarian state. The Bolsheviks rallied their loyal Red Guard millitia to overthrow the government, after a shot was fired from the pro-Bolshevik controlled Battleship *Aurora* Bolshevik milititias captured key areas, such as tellagraph stations, railways, and political offices in and around Petrograd, largely without meeting any resistence from the disorganised Provisional Government. During this time Lenin Rallied the people to support the Bolshevik cause under the slogan *'' Peace, Land and Bread!'' -* promising that the Bolsheviks would end the war (Peace) redistribute land to the peasants from the nobility, and provide food/work for the starving masses in the cities.

In 1918 an ellection for the Constitutional Assembly was held, the Bolsheviks did not win the election however Lenin rejected the results sighting the fact that the election had been rushed - the Bolsheviks had not had time to properly campaign, and the results did not take into account the fact that the winning party - the Social Revolutionaries had split into two factions, the popular Left Social Revolutionaries (who sometimes co-operated with the Bolsheviks) and the reactionary Right SRs. Lenin also critisied the Constitutional Assembly as taking power away from the Soviets. After giving the assembly a proposed motion that would limit it's power, which the assembly rejected, the Bolsheviks accused them of counter revolutionary activity and used this to shut down the assembly, while increasingly centralisng centralising power into the hands of the Bolshevik party. During this time Lenin refused to work with other Socialist party such as the SRs or the Menshaviks. In 1918 the political situation remained tense as the war continued and the Germans made large gains following the collapes of the Russian Army due to the Revolutions. in March 1918 the Capital was moved from Petrograd to Moscow as a precautionary measure, and Lenin took up residence in the Kremlin, also in March, the Bolsheviks start to negotiate an end to the war with Germany, in the end they were forced to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which while ending the war, seceded Large amounts of land to the Central Powers, mostly in the Baltics and Ukraine and was seen as a humiliating concession. 1918 also saw two assasination attempts on Lenin's life, most famously the one in August 1918 by SR dissident Fanny Kaplan, this even was used as a one of the  justifications by Lenin for the rolling out of *The Red Terror* a campaign of propaganda, arrests and executions that aimed to destroy counter-revolutionaries and help stabalise the political situation in a way that favored the Bolsheviks and Socialism.

Despite the War, assasinations and Red Terror, Lenin still implemented numourous reforms and polices in late 1917- through 1918, amoung these was the seizing of Aristocrat and church owned land and redistribution of it to the peasants, the switching of Russia from the Archaic Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, a mass literacy progam and free education were introduced, the seperation of church and state was declard and womens rights were promoted by the Socialist woman's organisation Zhenotdel, which was founded in 1919. Between 1918-22 Lenin was largely occupyed with matters to do with the Russian civil war as and had to implement a policy of 'War Communism' whcih saw the state grown in power and the apropriation of Grain from peasants for the war effort (essentially total war). Numous Reactionary factions attemted to topple his Socialist Government as well as invasions by the Polish and military intervention by the entente that saw American troops in Siberia and French and British in Ukrain fight the Red Army as well as peasant Uprising against the forced confiscation of grain and other goods for the war effort eg, the Tambov rebellion. The enormous pressure and stress of both the civil war and implementing Socialist policies and the woulds he receved from the assasination attempts cause Lenin's health to seriously decline during this period, and as the 1920s started Lenin's health only continued to decline and he suffured numourous strokes. Due to his declining health Lenin increasingly withdrew from political life and the day to day running fo the Party. In 1921 Lenin introduced the New Economic policy (NEP) this was essentially a form of state Capitalism, which was seen as a nessesary evil to help rebuild Russia after the ravages of not only the Civil war, but also the Famine of 1921-22 that it caused, and the devistation brought about by the Flu Pandemic. the early 1920s also saw projects to increas electrifoction of the country, something Lenin was vigerously in favor of. 1922 saw the fuit of all his work for Socialism as December of that year saw the official declaration of the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

In late 1923 Lenin wrote a testiment which gave critiques of several of the leading figures of the Bolshevik party, notably Trotsky and Stalin, the testiment recommended the removal of Stalin from the post of general Secritary, as Lenin remarked that he was ''too crude'' for the role, the document also critisized Trotsky fro being suceptable to being over buerocratic and idealistic. Crucially the document was vague about who should succeed Lenin and this was left unclear after his death and would lead to infighting inthe Bolshevik party following  Lenin's passing. Lenin died on the 21st of January 1924 at the age of 53. following his death he was given a State funeral with his body lying in state for mouners to few for several weeks, after which his body was eventually embalmed and placed in a temporary mausoleum in Red Square, this was latter replace by the perminent Mausoleum which stands to this very day with Lenins body still on display.

Hi guys :)

Would anyone be willing to take part in my survey for my dissertation? It should take roughly 5-10 minutes. It concerns your perceptions of sex offenders and it’s impact on the justice system. I hope to examine if public opinion can heavily influence custodial sentencing and if so, what factors mediate this. I’m in the final year of psychology and need anyone over the age of 18 and living in the UK. It would be much appreciated!

(Disclaimer: the survey concerns topics of sexual offending, so please do not participate if you have had past experiences or vulnerability to this topic. There are no details into the offences, it simply states that a sexual offence has been committed)

I would like to buy a house this year, because I will have little to no income during grad school next year, and literally buying a house (with excellent grants covering down payment and closing in my state)and paying mortgage payments is cheaper than renting. I know other grad students need cheap places to live, so I was planning on asking people in my program if they wanted to live with me. It would be 2-3 sharing a house, and it would be cheaper for all of us (I was thinking of asking for like 100+utilities a month, in my city the market rent for this same situation would run at least 600+utilities.)

I feel weird about this because I don’t want a world with private landlords, and at the end of them living with me they wouldn’t have a stake of ownership in the house…but we haven’t abolished private landlords yet, and they’re still in my city charging exorbitant rents, so this is the best option on the table currently.

dear all, hello. i am at a point in my life (college) where i am figuring out my beliefs and how that aligns with my everyday actions as well as what i study in school and my career choice. i recognize my privilege, i was lucky to be born into a family with significant wealth. i grew up w a new cell phone, vacations multiple times a year, etc. i am accustomed to that lifestyle and dont want to give it up. i have been thinking about what to study and for me right now its between journalism and computer science or economics. very different!  i have been learning a lot about how to budget salaries and realized that the journalist salary would be very low and uncomfortable for me. the idea of making 30k and living in a rural area (to save money) or trying to live on that in an expensive city is not appealing to me. upon talking to others, they said that parents usually help young entry level journalists with bills, rent, etc. i know my parents would be able to help me in this way if i asked but i feel ashamed to ask because 1) i should be able to support myself and 2) that worsens the problem for people who don't have a safety net and i don't want to take opportunities away from them. i could chose to learn about and pursue a career in something i'm less interested in and good at just to not let my parents help me financially (they said that it would not be a burden on them but the ethics concern me bc i feel that its not fair and i would preferably give them money as a thank u for raising me.) if i did it and didnt ask for their help, im concerned that the lack of economic safety net in this country (united states) would leave me struggling and facing tough choices like paying rent or food and i dont want to experience that. regarding career choice, while i feel guilt about wealth and spending their money in the beginning of my career without earning it myself, i dont want to be poor either. i also dont want to chose a profession that would not pay me enough to live comfortably. at the same time, i would like to enjoy what i do at my job and what i study in college. ahhh! what do u think about this?

i have been learning a lot about the experience of being poor in the united states and how tough it can be to live on minimum wage, it seems like minimum wage is below living wage and really sucks. it seems hard to save on that amount and treat urself because everything is going to bills. so ive been reading a lot about it and i realize that minimum wage is not enough to provide a comfortable lifestyle.

also, my parents recently offered to fund a study abroad program in europe this summer but idk whether or not to accept it bc feel so guilty about accepting bc theres so many people that dont have a roof over their head and are struggling. idk what to do, whether i should go or not. should i stop enjoying luxurious things bc so many people are unable to?

also im studying econ rn. is that bad? im like learning about stocks in class and then going home and reading about how they perpetuate inequality. is it morally ok to invest in the stock market? does it take away money from people who are working?

tldr: (pls read the post its alot more detailed) what kind of career should i pursue? how does money factor into that decision? how do you deal with being wealthy in a country where its so rough to be poor? can you use your wealth to go on vacations and go out to eat while also uplifting people who have less privilege and help them go on vacation? can you be rich and enjoy luxurious things and a leg up while also trying to end poverty?

i feel very confused about my next steps. sorry if i sound naive ive just started learning about living wage etc and am trying to form my opinion and figure out how to deal w capitalism and understand it, and what my next moves should be in this system. any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated, im feeling very confused rn.

I would like to read something non scientific, novels or poetry would be perfect. Obviusly i remarked that my authors' knowledge is mostly masculine. 

So which female great authors - who have meant something for you - and which of their publications would advise me to read?

Video about how the US funded Ukrainian neo-nazis,Liberal,0,sw8bqt,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/sw8bqt/video_about_how_the_us_funded_ukrainian_neonazis/,5,"So I recently watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtOx6dW_0vU) video by the Gravel institute about how the US (in)advertently has funded the Azov battalion and more generally the neo-nazi movement in Ukraine.

I am quite foggy about the chronological order of the conflict and Russia's more general involvement in support (or creating) the separatists in the Donbas region apart from the little green men, so the video has made me question my previous perception of the conflict.

Although this doesn't concern social-democracy that much, I am coming to this subreddit as I feel it has the ability to foster and provide the most nuanced and honest conversation on various topics.

My main questions are: 1) do you feel like support the Ukrainian army, including the Azov battalion can still be justified with the goal of driving out Russia even considering the fact that the training, funds and arms are bolstering an already quite influential neo-nazi movement in the country? 

2) Why do you think the US state department blocked the attempts to limit aid and training specifically to the neo-nazi branch? Is it a ""necessary evil"" to support the nazis to help them drive out Russians and if so do you think the West has a strategy to then limit their influence after the conflict ends (if it does and of course depending on how it does). 

3) Was the anger and outrage at the fact that the newly elected Ukrainian government in 2014 was quickly being usurped by neo-nazis enough to cause anti-governemnt protests that resulted in separatist rebellions in Donbas and a referendum in Crimea? I feel like this is one of the most iffiest points in the whole video bordering Russian propaganda. I think certain people were mad that the ultra right have gotten such high positions like the interior minister, but to make it seem liks this was enough for people to rebel on their own and to ask for seccession just because the new government had far-right members? The video seems to neglect the fact of Russian support and influence on the creation of those separatist movements.

My personal opinion is that support for Ukraine and it's army is still very much justified and I do hope that funding even the Azov battalion is a temporary measure to drive out Russians and that the West and Ukraine have a plan to then diminsh neo-nazi influence after the crisis hopefully ends. However, that doesn't seem very realistic and even if the crisis ends with Ukraine becoming a ""stable"" country the neo nazi influence won't just disappear. 

Nonetheless, I do think that the West can still support the Ukrainian army without necessarily sharing training and aid with the neo-nazi branch, and definitely not meeting with people who praise Adolf Hitler and sieg heil in public, like McCain and Biden have done.",1645271352.0

Logical Arguments for Filibuster Reform,Liberal,6,oofchx,progressive,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/oofchx/logical_arguments_for_filibuster_reform/,1,"It looks like Manchin and Sinema are still holding their positions on their filibuster, the threat it poses to democracy and progress notwithstanding. It seems that arguments regarding what could be accomplished by eliminating the filibuster will not work. Instead, logical arguments regarding and against the filibuster itself need to be made. I have proposed a couple below, and hope they can provide assistance to others who want to push the issue.

&#x200B;

* The Senate is currently 50-50, and even without the filibuster Manchin and Sinema can still shape policy by withholding their vote. By contrast, if they withhold their support for filibuster reform or abolishment, they run the risk of the Senate falling squarely within the control of either party. Once this happens, that party could get rid of the filibuster without them, and enact policies more extreme than they would like. By contrast, if the filibuster is reformed now, they can help craft a more moderate policy, preventing a future Congress from seeing the need to enact a policy they see as ""extreme.""
* The purpose the Senate was created was to protect the minority. The reason we have a Senate was to allow small states to have a voice equal to that of large states. If the founders believed that it was necessary to further protect minority rights, they would have written a supermajority threshold into the Constitution. The founders knew how to require a supermajority, as they did it both for amending the Constitution and overriding vetos. Since they didn't write it in here, they did not think it was necessary. There is no need to have the filibuster to ""protect minority rights"" in an institution that is designed to do exactly that without an added requirement.

&#x200B;

I will close with saying that even if Manchin and Sinema don't support full elimination, there are still viable alternatives, such as a talking filibuster. Another alternative that I have seen mentioned would be to have multiple votes to end a filibuster, with the vote threshold being lowered each time. In any case, at a minimum the rule should be changed so that any threshold is fulfilled when that fraction of the Senators present vote Yea. This would be instead of the current rule when the threshold is fuiffled when only when that fraction of all Senators, present or not, vote Yea.",1626828965.0

Women are getting assaulted by trusted males in their lives, women are not safe on streets, women are facing challenges in everyday life. Should we not focus more on that. 

I am not saying there women in workforce is NOT an issue. It is an issue, so is people of colour in leadership, which is where I am stuck at. I am far more capable from a lot of people I work with but I won't get to leadership sooner than them. They have the network, they have more common grounds with people in leadership. They will build stronger alliances and grow faster. 

My argument is we, both women and people of colour came in late. This was an issue 10, 20, 50 years ago. White males had a headstart and hence they have formed this network and trust at the top leave. We are surely breaking into it fast. I truely believe that making women safe or avoiding racism outside work will have a snowball effect.

**PREAMBLE**

Considering that it is a multipolar world, not a unipolar world of geopolitical hegemony, that has historically given class movements in multiple countries political momentum in terms of regular class struggle,

Considering that developing countries can play off competing imperialist powers against each other, especially on trade,

- Immediate, comprehensive ceasefire on the part of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation

- Withdrawal by the Russian Federation of heavy weapons

- OSCE monitoring

- Immediate constitutional reform in Ukraine including decentralization, taking into account the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic

- Withdrawal by the Russian Federation of remaining military equipment, foreign armed formations, and mercenaries - subject to the aforementioned constitutional reform

- All other provisions of Minsk II

- Immediate diplomacy for other relevant peace conditions

- Immediate end to all crackdowns on anti-war protesters

**US and EUROPE**

- No direct NATO member involvement whatsoever, including no-fly zones

- No support for individuals choosing to fight for the Ukrainian government

- No weapons deliveries to the Ukrainian government

- Abolition of all sanctions against the Russian people, including vital sectors of the Russian economy

- Immediate denunciation of chauvinist practices engaged by, or tolerated by, Ukraine

- Immediate acceptance of war refugees

- Immediate satisfaction of all geography-based security interests of the Russian Federation, on the part of all Atlanticist powers (the US and Europe)

*Trump has backed himself into an untenable position.* When he solicits votes for himself or any other GOP candidate he is implicitly suggesting the “election fraud” issue was an anomaly and unlikely to transpire again.

Anything less than total commitment to some kind of extreme measures to fix the “election fraud” will be seen by conservatives as a weak handed response. Anything less than commitment to an armed coup will upset his most ardent and extreme followers.

It will be interesting to see how he attempts to work his way around this issue. The smartest move here might be to take the easy way out- don’t commit to anything and make your speech vague as possible, with no promises or commitments to anything or anyone.

New commune initiative in Europe,Liberal,2,sp1sip,socialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/sp1sip/new_commune_initiative_in_europe/,0,"We (a group of 7 currently) would like to create a commune somewhere in the southern Europe (Galicia looks like a good place). I suppose this initiative may be relevant for people here.

The commune is to be built on the following premise: recreating society based on the scientific method, principles commonly accepted in science and open debate in order to maximise fulfilment and wellbeing of a human life.

The above-mentioned premise is the only thing that commune members should agree with. Everything else is to be derived from the premise. However, a commune member should also be open-minded as decision making is based on respectful debates. So be ready to debate on the topics of egalitarianism, antinatalism, veganism, anticapitalism, environmentalism, etc.

The reason for wanting to make a shared value system based on the premise is that one of the reasons why communes fail seems to be heterogeneity in values. With the proposed method we expect to solve that issue because people tend to do things that they find to be right if there are no obstacles. The reason why we have many different stances on things is because people may think that their stance is correct or someone else's stance is wrong because they based it on a different premise, have different information or a fault in logic. We took into account those three.

The currently proposed government/economic model looks pretty much like socialism. Hence, posting to this sub.

**Government/economic model**

No money or private property (to a sensible degree) in the commune. A non-profit organisation (NPO) will be established that is going to own all assets and handle monetary interactions with the outside world. Community members will be voting on all expenses that are going to be done by the NPO. The vote should be unanimous. If not, a debate will be held until everyone agrees. 

For-profit companies (FPCs) will be created in order to get money from the outside world. Companies should not require members to leave the community (or at least they must agree). The work that has to be done will be kept at minimum (no 40 hour work weeks). Members vote on what companies are established and how they operate. Example: a software development company (or some other remote work company), where community members volunteer to do work. Instead of hiring workers, companies can hire our company (no need to pay social tax, multiple people instead of one). 

Members are responsible for ensuring prosperity of the commune. Required jobs will be agreed upon together and posted for anyone to perform. Every member decides themselves how much they work and what they do.

I think the new generation is going to be fed news of impending doom for the future, caused by the decisions of the previous generations. I think as its looking more likely that we wont be able to prevent the global temperatures rising in time, a closer inspection of why? will occur, and inevitably the answer will lie on capitalisms relationship with consumerism and the vicious cycle or creating lots of crap nobody needs or 20 brands of butter and a totally unneccessary amount of choice everywhere.

Of course, money is the greatest incentive to innovation and capitalism could encourage the technology to save the day but imo the pendulum is moving the other way, and capitalisms pure inefficiencies on world resources may well see it overthrown, more likely to be replaced by a tech + socialism model OR countries exploiting the situation to monopolize resource through war.

It's not clear to me that increasing taxes on the wealthy will improve government nor society. 

Isn't it **better that the wealthy invest** in companies and nonprofits that compete vs a guaranteed cash flow to government?
If the wealthiest are taxed more as a percentage, what then?

Best case scenario: 
This redistribution of funds goes to support a certain societal safety net. And those who are middle income are taxed less so they can support their local economy and save/invest in their future.

Granting this best case scenario:
Would this be counterfactually worse than if the wealthiest invested in these communities? 
But I'm not certain that the increased tax dollars will actually go to help those in need.

Socialists (generally speaking) don't want to see past the hypothetical. They like the first order effects because that feels good.
However, I'm not certain that giving the government more power (via increased funding and programs) will actually help. Governments are corporations, too.

How would increased tax dollars impact the government? What about the organizations the ultra wealthy support?

The trouble is, while both of them seem to have current maps, both sites have drawn exactly opposite conclusions currently regarding who is ""winning"" and who is ""losing"" (aside from all Americans who truly believe in representative democracy who are the real losers in this case, regardless of political leaning).

Politico shows a net loss of 19 competitive districts with the GOP gaining 12 and the Dems gaining 7, respectively. FiveThirtyEight shows a net loss of 8 competitive districts with the GOP *losing* 3 and the Dems gaining 11, respectively. Thus the former site currently shows the GOP as overall gaining from gerrymandering and the latter site shows the Dems as overall gaining.

Both sites have the same left-center bias with high factual reporting according to media bias fact check, so I imagine the discrepancy comes from how they're actually tallying what a ""competitive"" versus a partisan district is. FiveThirtyEight shows details on their calculations while Politico is a bit more nebulous, but they both say they take demographics (notably racial makeup and college degrees) heavily into account.

There in New York he became involved with the Socialist Party. In 1917 he began his involvement with organizing workers into unions. In 1919 he became President of the National Brotherhood of Workers of America,  an union which organized among African American shipyard and dock workers. In 1925 he helped found and became the President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first African American trade union with a charter in the American Federation of Labor. He soon entered the young civil rights movement. He helped to organize demonstrations in 1941 that helped to push FDR to pass  Executive Order 8802 and sign the Fair Employment Act to fight discrimination in the defense industry.  He helped form the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service, which in 1947 successfully pressured Truman to end segregation in the armed forces. In the late 1950s he started to work with Martin Luther King Jr in the movement for integration in schools following Brown v. Board of Education. In 1963 he helped to organize and lead the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, giving the opening and closing speeches along with fellow Socialist Bayard Rustin. This event is famous for Martin Luthor King Jr.'s I Have A Dream speech. This march was vital in pushing the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. He remained a lifelong member of the Socialist Party, which in 1972 changed its name to Social Democrats USA. He died of natural causes in 1979.

Terrorism is not war, and war is not terrorism.  War requires the courage to face armed adversaries, fully prepared for the reality of being shot and killed for your beliefs.  Terrorism cannot be answered by the state, even retribution is impossible, because the perpetrators of terrorist acts almost never survive, and do not value life even if they did.

The **ONLY** thing that would make this whole mess less tragic is if it could somehow be undone - to lower the body count of the innocent.  The past can't be changed, but these events aren't done unfolding.  There will be more of them.

No policy will unwind the hate from the vile fundamentalist mind, nor stop them from arming themselves and finding their way into your local shopping mall, your kids' schools, your coffee shops, your churches and synagogues .  Policy can't do fuck-all about them, and neither can police.  These acts are calculated to happen in the places where people feel the most safe, where they are not on their guard, where the first responders will *always* be too late to prevent an urgent hardship from becoming a tragedy.  **That is the very point.**

Calling this ""an act of war"" is a feeble abstraction that makes it sound like there's some front to which we can march an army, away from the place where we can leave our precious and delicate loved ones safely behind, in homes that the enemy would never be able to reach.  But there is not.  The enemy defines the front, and that front is *where you least expect it.*

Gun control, and the cultivated culture of abnegating responsibility for personal security onto the police, the state, and anyone else is as much to blame for the scale of this awful catastrophe as the savage, regressive, hateful, inhuman shit-soup of Muhammed's chosen assholes.

"Internationalist, rebel, fathers shadow - Friedrich Adler",Liberal,12,r8nfyo,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/r8nfyo/internationalist_rebel_fathers_shadow_friedrich/,3,"Hello friends and comrades,

&#x200B;

after the last effortpost was about Victor Adler, I noticed that there was another famous person that I mentioned in this piece. Victors son, Friedrich Adler. A curious rebel, always in the shadow of his famous father with a lot of energy for the movement. So today I'd like to talk about Friedrich Adler.

&#x200B;

**Birth and upbringing**

Friedrich Wolfgang Adler was born on July 9th 1879 in Vienna. As mentioned before, Victor Adler (then only a physician) was his father. His mother Emma (born Braun) was the sister of the German Social Democrats Heinrich and Adolf Braun as well as an ardent socialist at heart. Raised in Vienna in good schools, he learned a lot about the probems of working class people and his fathers occupation as physician helped with that.

Victor always thought that Friedrichs unstable health alongside his leaning for fanaticism would not be fruitful for a political career. Instead, his father persuaded Friedrich to go to Switzerland after his *Matura* (final high school exam/A-level exam) to study. Friedrich went to Zürich and started his studies in Physics with his diploma as teacher in Physics and Mathematics in 1897. His Ph.D. came in 1902, again in Physics. While in Zürich he befriended famous scientist Albert Einstein, with whih he would share a life-long friendship.

&#x200B;

**First steps into the workers movement**

In 1909 both Adler and Einstein applied for the new post as professor for Theoretical Physics in Zürich, but Adler rescinded his application in favor of Einstein. Why he rescinded his application isn't sure, most say it was to better engage in the local workers movement.

Already in 1897 Adler joined the *Verband der österreichischen Sozialdemokratie in der Schweiz* (Organisation of the Austrian Social Democracy in Switzerland) and from 1898 onwards as writer for the Swiss newspaper *Volksrecht* (whose Chief Editor Adler would be from 1910 to 1911). Alongside this, in 1901 Adler took up a leading position in the *Verband der Internationalen Arbeitervereine in der Schweiz* (Organisation of International Workers Unions in Switzerland). This would prove as a first omen for his future as an internationally minded Social Democrat. 

Interestingly enough is one small thing in Adlers life story. As Einstein went to the University of Prague in 1911, he recommended Friedrich Adler to take up his former posting in Zürich as his sucessor. But Adler refused this offer. Instead, in the same year he returned to Vienna - becoming one of the four Party Secretaries (alongside Otto Bauer) and editor for *Der Kampf* (The fight), the theoretical monthly paper of the SDAPÖ. Here he showed his interest for an internationalist and pacifist course but remained alone with this. Instead, he set his hopes on the Zweite Internationale (Second Internationale) to keep the peace in Europe, especially as the Balkans began to crumble once again.

&#x200B;

**First World War**

As a pacifist and antimilitarist, Friedrich Adler was against the war and the great hoorah of the European nations for this conflict. Adding to this, the Second Internationale weakened and dismantled itself as most members supported their nations in the war, known as *Burgfriedenspolitik* (Union Sacrée, Party Peace) as well as the position the SDAPÖ took, supporting the Monarchy in the war against Serbia and Russia. He even believed that this position of the party would strengthen the Tsarist Reaction. After a matialistic-patriotic piece by Chief Editor Friedrich Austerlitz in the *Arbeiter-Zeitung* (Workers Paper) in October 1914, Friedrich started is way into isolationism - attacking Prime Minister Stürkgh and his policies in regards to the war as well as the party and his own father, who was leader of the party.

Friedrich didn't serve in the military, as did a lot of higher-ups in the Party. On October 20th 1916, he held a very sharp attack against the party leadership, completing his isolationism in the party. One day later, a weapon would be his new tool.

&#x200B;

**The Shooting of Stürkgh**

One day after the fateful speech, on October 21st 1916, Friedrich Adler killed Austrian Prime Minister Karl Stürkgh in the Dining Hall of the famous Viennese Hotel Meissl & Schadn with a pistol. The reactions in the party were distant, Friedrich Austerlitz wrote that the action was *""\[...\] der ganzen sozialistischen Ideenwelt fremd und unbegreiflich.""* (foreign and incomprehensible to the socialist world of ideas), adding that Adler was a human  *„der einem Wahne folgt“*  (following an illusion) committing himself to  „*unseligen Tat \[…\] im Fanatismus der Selbstzerstörung \[…\] selbst dahin gibt und grausam vernichtet, was noch ein reiches Blühen versprach.“* (an unncessary action in fanatisicm and self-destruction, sacrificing himself and destryoing violently what promised a rich blossoming).

This action showed a great irony: Friedrich Adler, a pacifist, killed the Prime Minister.

In the trial, Adler used this as a floor for agitation against his own party, for a reckoning. Saying that the bureaucratic apparatus has taken over the party, he launched his hate primarily against the Refomist Karl Renner, accusing him of cowardice and loss of principle. The tip of the iceberg was, that Adler accused the party of becoming the reactionary element in Austria itself - leaving the ideas of the Second Internationale. Adler justified his action to start a process of rethinking in the party and if possible in society, being an assassination against Austrian Morale - establishing the psychological foundation for coming mass actions in the country.

As expected, Friedrich Adler was sentenced to death. Oddly enough, shortly after the trial Austerlitz changed his opinion of Adler in his articles, saying that he was at least a *""Märtyrer seiner Überzeugung“* (martyr of his own belief) who sacrificed himself in ardent bravery to serve Social Democracy and its ideas. A pardon of the newly crowned Emperor Karl I. reduced his sentence to 18 years imprisonment, which was cancelled after Karl gave Adler an amnesty as one of his last acts as Emperor in November 1918.

Adler was freed on November 9th 1918 and returned to Vienna on the next day awaited by his brother Siegmund and his father Victor.

Surprisingly, the party didn't follow his ideas, rather confirming the party leadership and adding karl Renner into the main leadership board, the *Parteivorstand*. But the masses received the message, slowly but surely the party would transition away from supporting the war outright.

&#x200B;

**Friedrich Adler as hero of the people in the ""Austrian Revolution""**

Shortly after his liberation from prison, the SDAP as well as the Communists regarded Adler as hero of the people, the latter tried to get him to join their movement by granting him the position of Party leader - which he both refused. Instead, Adler reamained true with the Social Democratic Party, maybe because he thought that after the death of his father (November 11th 1918, one day after he returned) it was the right thing to do. As one of the main figures in the party, he took over the lead for the workers councils - defeating the first try of Communists to take over on November 12th 1918 but the situation remained tense with a communist uprising in Hungary and Bavaria. Another try of taking over (helped by leaders of the Third Internationale) was again defeated in June 1919. His actions, as Otto Bauer said it, saved Austria.

&#x200B;

**The Internationalist**

The party reshuffled its posts in the leadership after the death of Friedrichs father Victor. Party leadership went to Karl Seitz (a Reformist) with Otto Bauer being the real man in charge as Chief Ideologue. bauers idea of *Integraler Sozialismus* (Integral Socialism - unting the split workers movement) was recognised as a necessity by Adler. Therefore, he led the *Internationale Arbeitsgemeinschaft sozialistischer Parteien* (International Working Group of Socialst Parties). The idea behind this organisation was to lead the reformists towards revolutionary action while calming the Soviet Regine down and bringing it to a social democracy. But as the first talks showed that the trenches were too deep, the group returned back to the Second Internationale and fusioned with it to the *Sozialistische Arbeiterinternationale* (Socialist Workers Internationale) in 1923. Up until 1940, Friedrich Adler would remain leader of this Internationale.

Julius Braunthal, his secretary, said the following about Adler:

 *„Er war aber der Kopf der Internationale. Er steuerte ihre Politik in den zahllosen Kommissionssitzungen, die in den Perioden zwischen den Kongressen über seine Anregung zusammentraten, und in den Sitzungen des Büros und der Kongresse, deren Beratungen und Beschlüsse er durch Memoranden vorbereitete. Er stellte durch die Vorschläge der Tagesordnung der Konferenzen die Probleme im Einklang mit seiner Politik zur Debatte und beeinflusste durch die Wahl der Referenten die politische Linie ihrer Behandlung.“* 

(But he was the head of the Internationale. He led its politics in the countless meetings that happned in the periods between the congresses assembling over his proposal, as well as in the meetings of the bureau and the congresses, whose talks and resolutions he prepared with memoranda. Through putting the recommendations of the congresses agenda, he set the problems in accordance with his politics to debate and influenced through the vote of the speakers the political line of their treatment.)

But this Internationale soon dissolved. In 1933 its last congress occured - in 1940 it was dissolved as he head to flee Paris during the German advance into France. Before the flight, adler helped the SPD in exile by moderating the sides and supporting the resisitance in Germany itself.

&#x200B;

**Informal leader of Soial Democratic Exile**

After the Anschluss in 1938, a lot of the illegal Social Democrats had to flee Austria and the Exile in Brno in Czechoslovakia. Alread in March, the Organisation fled to Brussels where the *Revolutionären Sozialisten* (the resistiance in Austria up to that point) should fuse with the *Auslandsbüro der österreichischen Sozialisten* (Foreign Bureau of the Austrian Socialists, ALÖS) to the *Auslandsvertretung der österreichischen Sozialisten* (Foreign Representation of the Austrian Socialists, AVOES). Friedrich Adler became a leading figure of this organisation - becoming the de facto leader after the death of Otto Bauer in July 1938 in Paris.

As mentioned, AVOES and the Internationale had to flee - they went to New York with some of AVOES estabilshing another office in London. They could not achieve a unified representation for Austria though. The leader Joseph Buttinger left AVOES in 1941, Adler remained as now leader. In early 1942 he established the Austrian Labor Commitee (ALC).

&#x200B;

**In the wilderness - later life and death**

Slowly but surely, Adler left the work of the ALC - criticising parts of its work. In 1944, he rescinded his post as ALC boss, transfering it to Otto Leichter.

Returning to Europe in 1946, Adler was confronted with the question of the KPÖ towards the new SPÖ about its position to the Anschluss. While Renner in his position as Federal President was able to distance himself from this, Friedrich Adler couldn't. He saw himself as an Internationalist, German and then Austrian. The reactions to this were quite strong and only hardened the belief that he should leave politics. First closing the office in Brussels he went to Switzerland to his daughters, working on the History of the Workers Movement.

Adler published the correspondence between his father and Karl Kautsky as well as with August bebel in 1954. The biography he planned about his father was never finished as he lacked the power for it in his later years. His last visit to Vienna in 1952 for the 100th birthday of his father was a triumphant one, greeted warmly by the party.

Friedrich Adler died on January 2nd 1960 in Zürich aged 80. He was buried in the grave of his father at Viennas Zentralfriedhof with a street named after him in Favoriten in 1989.

&#x200B;

**Final remarks**

Friedrich Adler remains a bit of a mystery to this day, his whole life being filled with dialectics. As son of the party founder he had to walk in great shoes, as pacifist he killed a prime minister and as ""defender of Austria"" he saw himself as German, as Internationalist remaining calm but unclear about the main line. Especially his belief in Socialism bordered towards devout religiousness. he followed a way between Social Democracy and Bolshevism in the interwar years, but had to see it fail.

Still, his achievements for Austrian Social Democracy were and still are great ones. He was the hero very few people talk about today. While being a mystery, I was able to learn a few things of his life for mine and I regard him as a living dialectic - something that I have to live with myself. But Friedrich Adler showed me that it is a necessity to live such a dialectic: remaining realistic but seeking for a better future, a utopia so to say.

"Flipped Script: An experiment in telling men to smile the same way they often tell women to, as if they were entitled to smiling women",Liberal,215,n92ztc,feminisms,https://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/n92ztc/flipped_script_an_experiment_in_telling_men_to/,23,"I hope this is not in violation of the rules. 

So when I saw a post last week about a woman sick of being told to smile, it inspired me.  I've seen the type of complaint before, but this one made me realize exactly how pernicious it was.  I decided to try it on men, and especially those who told a woman too. The results were amusing, and a couple of stories worth telling so I thought I would share.

I'm a 41 year old overweight male, which I feel is important for the context of the reactions I got.  I consider myself feminist, and read several women's subreddits so i can better understand issues i am not directly affected by, because i can better speak out when i see issues when i am more aware of them.  

First, I counted a total of 104 men I told to smile. Of those

23 ignored me completely

31 Actually smiled (plus 4 who laughed)

18 gave me strange looks but otherwise did not react

29 got varying degrees of offended (16 of whom called me gay)

2 threatened me with violence

1 threatened me with sexual harassment

Of special note, those who I told to smile after they told a woman to were FAR more likely to fall into the offended category than the actual smile category. Be aware none of these men did I react instantly to tell them to smile, but waited a few minutes to let their incident be ""cold"".

Three stories are really worth sharing.

The first happened on day 2 of the experiment. As part of one of my cases was a zoom call with a judge and the opposing council. Before the session was called, the opposing lawyer told my client they should smile instead of scowl (she wasn't scowling, she was just waiting nervously). She ignored him and I said nothing as the court was called into session. During the first recess, at the end as we were returning but before it was called back into session, I told him ""You should smile more when you talk, you are more handsome that way"". He went purple and told me it was ""wildly inappropriate to talk to him like that"". I asked him why he thought it was ok for him to speak to my client that way then. The judge said nothing, but she did chuckle before starting the session. I'm certain she has had her share of the problem too.

Second story was the threat of sexual harassment. This was in a grocery store. The man told the clerk she needed to smile as she started ringing him up. I waited till she was done, and as he was gathering the last of his bags, I told him his face would be more attractive if he smiled. He got MAD. And threatened to sue me for ""sexual harassment"". I pointed out that since we had no work relationship, he couldn't, but what he did to the young woman WAS harassment. He yelled again (wish i had written down what) then left before the scene got any further.

The last story worth telling was the good one with a better ending. This time a contractor doing some work in the building, told one of our aides the smile. So later that day, made an excuse to pass by where he was working and told him to smile. His first reaction was to be offended. But then he actually caught himself and said ""wait, is this because i said it to the girl earlier"". I nodded, and that was the end of it. Now I don't know if the question to him was a moment of self awareness about how uncomfortable it was, or just thinking I was getting revenge and he brushed it off, but I'd like to think the former? Maybe?

Anyway, I don't really have a point just thought I'd share this hoping you all found it as amusing as I did.

I wish i had kept better numbers how many of these were after they told a woman to smile, vs just told to smile and exact numbers on the difference.",1620648835.0

"Russian Communist Workers Party (RKWP-KPSS) ""We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the workers of Kazakhstan!""",Liberal,13,rxrbys,DemocraticSocialism,https://www.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/rxrbys/russian_communist_workers_party_rkwpkpss_we_stand/,3,"    
The Russian Communist Workers' Party (RKWP-KPSS) expresses class solidarity with the striking workers of Kazakhstan    
Statement of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the RKWP-CPSU    
The beginning of 2022 in Kazakhstan was marked by a workers' strike in the Mangistau region. The reason for the speech was a shock jump in gas prices - two times. And the real reasons are that the 30-year domination of capitalism in Kazakhstan has led to an enormous growth of social contradictions. The luxury of the elite is side by side with the poverty of the working masses. People are especially hated by the prosperity and reign of the Nazarbayev clan, the former secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, who turned from a comrade into a master and guarantor of the exploiting class    
The strikers' first demands were purely economic - lower gas prices for consumers, higher wages and better working conditions. A strike began in the workers' town of Zhanaozen, well-known to us and to the whole world, where in 2011 a many-month strike of oil workers took place, brutally suppressed by the authorities. The protesters were shot at. Dozens of workers were killed, hundreds were arrested and imprisoned. The RCWP, ROT FRONT and many communist and workers' parties of the world then expressed fraternal solidarity with the strikers, an angry protest against the inhuman reprisals, and carried out numerous support actions. Representatives of our party, with a real risk to their lives, went to the scene of the events, where they met with workers' leaders, handed over material support, and expressed a strong protest to the regional authorities.    
Events unfolded rapidly. Since the authorities as usual did not react in any way to the protests of workers, in just a few days the strike covered the entire region, and then escalated into mass unrest. The workers were supported by city dwellers, then workers in many regions of Kazakhstan went on strike in solidarity with their class brothers. The authorities indicated their readiness to make partial concessions. But the workers and the rising people were no longer satisfied with pitiful handouts from the master's shoulder. The authorities began to pull troops to large cities. And then the protesting masses of Kazakhstan literally revolted, already putting forward political demands for the resignation of the country's government and the departure from power of the hateful Nazarbayev clan.    
The authorities were really afraid of the strength of the united people, the president satisfied all the economic demands and sent the Government into resignation.    
However, one cannot calm down and celebrate victory. Power in the country remains in the hands of big business. The troops have not been returned to their places of permanent deployment. The enterprises are in the hands of the former owners. The authorities have already turned to their CSTO partners for help, who understand the danger of an example of a popular uprising for other republics. It should be understood that the bourgeoisie of Kazakhstan crossed the line already in 2011 by shooting the workers of Zhanaozen. Today they will probably stop at nothing. At the slightest opportunity, all the concessions snatched from the gentlemen will be taken back, repression will return with the same fury. Capital cannot exist without exploitation. Therefore, the workers need to organize themselves into class organizations and fight not for a change from one clan to another, but for their workers' power. The communists understand that these protests cannot do without the participation of other capitalist clans opposing the Nazarbayev family - the synchronization of the protests and the one-sided orientation of slogans was too obvious. It is no secret that for many years in the territory of the former Soviet republics various NGOs, funded by capital, have been working on the training of universal activists, incl. large foreign states. Activists have their own headquarters, finances, connections and at a certain moment they try to ride the protests and take them in the direction their owners need, reducing everything to replacing one ruling clique with another, but leaving inviolable the relations of private property. Any mass action by the people awakens various social strata to political life. Our party expresses unconditional support to those working people who is fighting against the abominations of capitalism and the ruling elite who have lost all shame. We see in their struggle the growth of the self-awareness of the working class, the acquisition of invaluable experience of successful struggle and the awareness of the need to organize the class. Of particular importance is the awareness of the need for class solidarity, the transition from demands for one master to demands for the entire ruling class, and from purely economic demands to political ones. We strongly condemn the actions of the declassed elements, provocateurs and marauders who joined the popular protest, discrediting the actions of the multinational proletariat of Kazakhstan and making it easier for the authorities to forcefully suppress strikes, rallies and demonstrations under the guise of ""protecting the population from terrorists.""

We see that it is still far from the revolutionary situation. So far, the workers of Kazakhstan have neither an organization, nor, moreover, a communist consciousness. But they took a step forward in their struggle, and this step must find our support.    
The authorities of Kazakhstan and the bourgeoisie of the Russian Federation with one voice are diligently bypassing the class essence of events and are trying to reduce their assessments to intimidation by the ""Maidan"". In the ranks of the protesters, pogromists and nationalists are already playing a provocative role. This is a well-known tactic of the bourgeoisie - to distort the essence of events, to reduce them from the class struggle to conspiracies and coups. The communists have already learned lessons from the events in Ukraine and have long warned that even if there was no Maidan, it would be profitable for the bourgeoisie to invent it as a scarecrow.    
We know that every step in the class struggle is a step forward. Today they will learn to make limited demands, they will feel their strength, having achieved a reduction in prices and the resignation of the government, tomorrow, you see, and a party with knowledge of the way will be found, - they will figure it out and go further - to socialism.    
We protest against the use of CSTO forces as gendarmes!    
We protest against the interference of the Russian Federation in the affairs of Kazakhstan and the possible use by the Russian authorities of the experience of the bloody suppression of the indignation of the people in October 1993.    
We demand from the authorities of Kazakhstan not to allow repressions against the people, we demand the release of all political prisoners, incl. convicted of participating in the Zhanaozen protests in 2011    
We demand freedom of action for trade unions, the abolition of bans on the activities of the Communist Party of the Republic, legalization of the actions of the Socialist Movement of Kazakhstan;    
There is no fascization of the CSTO regimes and authorities!    
Long live class solidarity!    
Long live proletarian internationalism!    
Workers of Russia! Rise to the fight against the power of capital together with Kazakhstani class brothers!

What is a reactionary?,Liberal,13,qgeb4t,SocialDemocracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/qgeb4t/what_is_a_reactionary/,22,"What is a reactionary? Like I think I know, but I don't feel like I understand it. Sorry if it's a stupid question, this might be coming from the fact that in my language it's not really used as term, we just have conservative.

From common use one can make the conclusion that reactionary=conservative, but is it though?

from wikipedia:

> In political science, a reactionary or a reactionist is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante, the previous political state of society, which that person believes possessed positive characteristics absent from contemporary society. 


From the above description I would make a conclusion that a reactionary is someone that does not necessarily have an ideology on how things should be, but simply prefers things to a prior state of things - left or right. For example if a conservative government made a change that I dislike and want to revert it, it would make me a reactionary. Another example, someone sympathetic to the soviet regime wanting things to go back as they were (I'm from the Baltics) is also a reactionary. But a conservative party implementing Reagan/Thatcher type economic reforms in the Baltics would not be reactionary as there was never a precedent for them, but still could be considered conservative?

This would make reactionaries VERY context specific.

Also, left wingers wanting to go back to some type of new-deal type economics could be also considered a reactionary?

Edit: it seems like ""reactionary"" tends to have negative connotations, and for me it seems to be - ""it depends"".",1635276978.0
